        "INTEREST OF AMICI \n\nAmici curiae  are  professors  of  international \nlitigation  with  expertise  in  the  various  doctrines  of \nU.S. law based on international comity. They have a \nstrong  interest  in  the  proper  application  of  these \ndoctrines  by  U.S.  courts.  A  list  of  amici  and  their \nqualifications is provided in the appendix.1 \n\nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nPetitioners alleged that respondents and their \nco-conspirators  established  a  cartel  to  fix  the  prices \nof  vitamin  C  exported  to  the  United  States  in \nviolation of Section 1 of the Sherman Act. 15 U.S.C. \n§  1.  Respondents  did  not  deny  the  allegations  but \nrather  claimed  that  their  actions  had  been  required \nby  Chinese  law,  and  respondents  moved  to  dismiss \nthe  complaints  under  the  act  of  state  doctrine,  the \ndoctrine  of \nforeign  sovereign  compulsion,  and \nprinciples  of  international  comity. In re Vitamin C \nAntitrust Litigation,  837  F.3d  175,  180  (2d  Cir. \n2016).  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  of  the  People’s \nRepublic  of  China  filed  an  amicus  brief  supporting \nrespondents,  which  represented  that  under  Chinese \nlaw  all  vitamin  C  legally  exported  during  the \nrelevant  time  had  to  be  sold  at  coordinated  prices. \nId.  at  182.  The  district  court  rejected  each  of \nrespondents’  three  defenses,  both  upon  a  motion  to \n\n1  All  parties  have  consented  to  the  filing  of  this  brief. \nPetitioners’  consent  is  on  file  with  the  Clerk.  On  February  15, \n2018,  Respondents  filed  a  blanket  consent  letter  with  the \nClerk. No counsel for any party has authored this brief in whole \nor in part, and no person other than amici or their counsel has \nintended  to  fund  the \nmade  any  monetary  contribution \npreparation or submission of this brief. \n\n1",
        "judgment.  Id.  After  a \n\ndismiss  and,  following  discovery,  upon  a  motion  for \nsummary \nfound \nrespondents liable for violating the Sherman Act, the \ndistrict  court  awarded  petitioners  approximately \n$147  million  in  damages  and  permanently  enjoined \nrespondents  from  further  violations  of  the  Sherman \nAct. Id. \n\njury \n\nOn  appeal,  the  Second  Circuit  declined  to \naddress  the  act  of  state  doctrine  or  the  doctrine  of \nforeign sovereign compulsion. Id. at 194. Instead, the \ncourt of appeals held that “principles of international \ncomity  required  the  district  court  to  abstain  from \nexercising  jurisdiction  in  this  case.” Id.  at  179.  The \ncourt  of  appeals  applied  a  “multi-factor  balancing \ntest,”  id.  at  184-85,  developed  by  the  Ninth  and \nThird Circuits in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of \nAm., N.T. & S.A.,  549  F.2d  597,  614-15  (9th  Cir. \n1976),  and  Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum \nCorp.,  595  F.2d  1287,  1297-98  (3d  Cir.  1979).  The \nSecond Circuit read this Court’s decision in Hartford \nFire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993), \nas  establishing  a  prerequisite  to  any  such  analysis: \nthat complying with both U.S. and foreign law would \nbe  impossible.  Vitamin C,  837  F.3d  at  185-86.  To \nanswer  that  preliminary  question,  the  court  of \nappeals had to determine the content of Chinese law \nand thus “the amount of deference that we extend to \nthe  Chinese  Government’s  explanation  of  its  own \nlaws.” Id.  at  186. The  court  held  that  it  was  “bound \nthe  Chinese  Government’s \nto \nto \nrepresentations.  Id.  at  189. \nthat \nIt \nrespondents  could  not  comply  with  both  U.S.  and \nChinese law, id. at 192, and after weighing the other \nfactors  in  its  multi-factor  test,  the  court  of  appeals \nits \nconcluded  that  “the  district  court  abused \ndiscretion  by  failing  to  abstain  on  international \n\ndefer” \n\nfound \n\n2",
        "comity  grounds  from  asserting  jurisdiction.”  Id.  at \n194. \n\nin \n\nerred \n\ntreating \n\nPetitioners  filed  a  petition  for  certiorari \npresenting  three  questions:  (1)  whether  the  court  of \nappeals  erred  in  reviewing  the  motion  to  dismiss \nrather than the final judgment; (2) whether the court \nthe  Chinese \nof  appeals \nGovernment’s  representation  as  conclusive;  and  (3) \nwhether the court of appeals erred in holding that it \ncould  abstain  from  exercising  jurisdiction  on  a  case-\nby-case basis. In response to this Court’s call for the \nviews  of  the  United  States,  the  Solicitor  General \nrecommended that the petition be granted limited to \nthe  second  question  presented,  noting  possible \nprocedural  problems  with  the \nfirst  and  third \nquestions.  This  Court  granted  certiorari  limited  to \nthe second question in the petition. \n\nto  answer \n\nIn  answering  that  question,  the  Court  should \ntake  care  not  to  endorse  the  Second  Circuit’s \ndoctrine of abstention based on international comity. \nFirst, as this Court acknowledged when it limited its \ngrant  to  the  second  question,  it  is  not  necessary  to \naddress  abstention \nthe  question \npresented.  The  principle  of  international  comity  is \nthe  foundation  for  many  doctrines  of  U.S.  law,  each \nof  which  has  specific  requirements  tailored  to  a \nparticular  context.  How  much  weight  a  U.S.  court \nshould  give  as  a  matter  of  international  comity  to \nthe representation of a foreign government about the \ncontent  of  its  own  law  is  a  separate  question  from \nwhether a U.S. court should be allowed to dismiss a \ncase over which it has subject matter jurisdiction on \nthe basis of international comity.  \n\nSecond,  the  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine  of \nabstention  based  on  international  comity  conflicts \n\n3",
        "(2010) \n\n(2016) \n\n(criticizing \n\nwith  the  decisions  of  this  Court  and  threatens  to \nsupplant  more  narrowly \ntailored  doctrines  of \ninternational  comity.  Viewed  as  a  doctrine  of \nprescriptive  comity,  the  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine \nconflicts  with  this  Court’s  decisions  finding  that  a \ncase-by-case  balancing  approach  is  “too  complex  to \nprove  workable.”  F.  Hoffmann-La  Roche  Ltd.  v. \nEmpagran S.A.,  542  U.S.  155,  168  (2004); see also \nRJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community,  136  S. \nCt.  2090,  2108 \n(rejecting  “case-by-case \ninquiry”); Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., \n561  U.S.  247,  259 \nthe \n“methodology  of  balancing  interests”).  Viewed  as  a \ndoctrine  of  adjudicative  comity,  the  Second  Circuit’s \ndoctrine  runs  against  the  “virtually  unflagging \nobligation  of  the  federal  courts  to  exercise  the \njurisdiction  given  them.”  Colorado  River  Water \nConservation Dist. v. United States,  424  U.S.  800, \n817  (1976).  The  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine  also \nthreatens  to  supplant  more  narrowly  tailored \ndoctrines  of  international  comity,  such  as  the \ndoctrine of foreign sovereign compulsion and the act \nof state doctrine that were raised below in this case. \nThis  Court  has  carefully  placed  limits  on  each  of \nthose doctrines, limits that would effectively become \nirrelevant  if  this  Court  were  to  endorse  the  broad \ndoctrine  of  abstention  that  the  Second  Circuit \napplied.  \n\nHaving  granted  certiorari \n\nlimited  to  the \nsecond question presented, this Court should answer \nthat  question  only  and  should  not  prejudge  any  of \nthe other comity questions raised by this case. \n\n4",
        "ARGUMENT \n\nI. \n\nIT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS \nABSTENTION BASED ON \nINTERNATIONAL COMITY IN ORDER TO \nANSWER THE QUESTION PRESENTED \n\nof  doctrines  based \n\nAs  argued  to  the  courts  below,  this  case \ninvolves  a  number \non \ninternational  comity.  Those  doctrines  include  the \nthree defenses raised by respondents and  addressed \nby  the  district  court:  the  act  of  state  doctrine,  the \ndoctrine  of \nforeign  sovereign  compulsion,  and \nabstention  based  on  international  comity.  They  also \ninclude the recognition of foreign law, and as part of \nthat  analysis,  the  question  presented  in  this  case  of \nwhat  deference  to  give  a  foreign  government’s \nrepresentations in determining the content of foreign \nlaw.  The  Second  Circuit  answered  the  question \npresented  in  the  context  of  applying  a  doctrine  of \nabstention  based  on  international  comity.  But  those \ntwo  comity  questions  are  distinct,  and  it  is  not \nnecessary for this Court to address abstention based \non  international  comity  in  order  to  answer  the \nquestion presented.  \n\n“International  comity  reflects  deference  to \nforeign  states  that  international  law  does  not \nmandate.”  Restatement \nof  Foreign \nRelations  Law  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction \n§ 101  cmt.  a  (Am.

Rev. 2071, 2099-2019 (2015) (reviewing doctrines).  \n\nPrescriptive comity is the basis for recognizing \nforeign  law,  both  under  conflict-of-laws  rules,  see, \ne.g., Bank of Augusta v. Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, \n589 (1839) (“[T]he laws of one [country], will, by the \ncomity  of  nations,  be  recognized  and  executed  in \nanother  .  .  .  .”),  and  under  the  act  of  state  doctrine, \nsee, e.g., Oetjen v. Cent. Leather Co.,  246  U.S.  297, \n303-04  (1918)  (noting  that  the  act  of  state  doctrine \n“rests  at  last  upon  the  highest  considerations  of \ninternational  comity  and  expediency”).  This  Court \nhas also held that “principles of prescriptive comity” \nmay limit the reach of U.S. law. Empagran, 542 U.S. \nat 169; see also RJR, 136 S.

Doctrines  of \nadjudicative  comity  like forum non conveniens  may \nalso restrain the jurisdiction of U.S. courts. See RJR, \n136  S.  Ct.  at  2115  (Ginsburg,  J.,  concurring  and \ndissenting)  (noting  that  “comity  concerns”  can  be \nmet  through  “the  doctrine  of forum non conveniens \n[that]  enables  U.S.  courts  to  refuse  jurisdiction”); \n\npublication of which is expected in 2018.

Because \nthe  petitioners  in Hartford Fire  did  not  claim  that \ncompliance  with  both  U.S.  and  foreign  law  was \n“impossible,” this Court reasoned that there was “no \nneed \nother \nconsiderations  that  might  inform  a  decision  to \nrefrain from the exercise of jurisdiction on grounds of \ninternational  comity.”  Id.  at  799.5  The  Second \nCircuit read Hartford Fire “narrowly,” “as suggesting \nthat  the  remaining  factors  in  the  comity  balancing \n\nlitigation \n\naddress \n\nthis \n\nin \n\nto \n\n5 In Hartford Fire, Justice Scalia argued in dissent that \ncustomary  international  law  requires  a  balancing  of  factors  in \neach  case  to  determine  if  the  exercise  of  jurisdiction  is \nreasonable,  relying  on  Section  403  of  the  Restatement  (Third) \nof  Foreign  Relations  Law  of  the  United  States  (Am.

The  International  Court  of  Justice  has  held \nthat  “the  existence  of  a  rule  of  customary  international  law \nrequires  that  there  be  ‘a  settled  practice’  together  with opinio \njuris.”  Jurisdictional Immunities of the State (Germ. v.

In the absence of settled state practice, no customary-\ninternational-law  obligation  can  exist.  For  this  reason,  the \nRestatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law concludes that \n“state  practice  does  not  support  a  requirement  of  case-by-case \nbalancing  to  establish  reasonableness  as  a  matter  of \ninternational  law.”  Restatement  (Fourth)  of  Foreign  Relations \nLaw  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction  § 211  reporters’  note  3 \n(Am.

This  Court \nrejected that argument, concluding that such a case-\nby-case  approach  was  “too  complex  to  prove \nworkable.”  Id.  As  an  example  of  this  unworkable, \nbalancing  approach,  the  Court  cited  Mannington \nMills, see id.,  one  of  the  two  cases  from  which  the \nits  multi-factor  test.

See 15 U.S.C. § 6a \ntrade  or \n(limiting  FTAIA \ncommerce  “other  than  import  trade  or  import \ncommerce”).

See, e.g., Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1293-\n94;  Trugman-Nash, Inc. v. N.Z. Dairy Bd.,  954  F. \nSupp.  733,  736  (S.D.N.Y.  1997);  Interamerican \nRefining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc.,  307  F. \nSupp.  1291,  1304 \n(D.  Del.  1970);  see  also \nDepartment of Justice & Federal Trade Commission, \nAntitrust  Guidelines  for  International  Enforcement \nand  Cooperation  §  4.2.2  (2017)  (recognizing  foreign \nsovereign  compulsion  defense  to  antitrust  claims). \nWhere courts have recognized the doctrine of foreign \nsovereign  compulsion,  they  have  generally  imposed \ntwo  requirements:  (1)  that  “the  person  in  question \nappears likely to suffer severe sanctions for failing to \ncomply with foreign law”; and (2) that “the person in \nquestion  has  acted  in  good  faith  to  avoid  the \nconflict.”  Restatement  (Fourth)  of  Foreign  Relations \nLaw  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction  §  222  (Am. \nLaw Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2016).  \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  discretionary  abstention \ndoctrine  would  supplant  the  more  narrowly  tailored \ndoctrine  of  foreign  sovereign  compulsion.  Before \nabstaining  on  grounds  of  international  comity,  the \ncourt  of  appeals  did  not  require  a  showing  that \nlikely  to  suffer  severe \nrespondents  would  be \n\n18",
        "sanctions  or  even  that  respondents’  conduct  had \nbeen  compelled.  Instead,  the  court  held  that  “[e]ven \nif Defendants’ specific conduct was not compelled by \n[Chinese  law],  that  type  of  compulsion  is  not \nrequired”  under  the  comity  balancing  test. Vitamin \nC, 837 F.3d at 192. Neither did the court of appeals \nrequire  a  showing  that  respondents  had  acted  in \ngood  faith  to  avoid  the  conflict.  Instead,  the  court \nheld  that  “[w]hether  Defendants  had  a  hand  in  the \nChinese  government’s  decision  to  mandate  some \nlevel  of  price-fixing  is  irrelevant”  under  the  test  it \napplied.  Id.  at  191.  By  allowing  dismissal  of  an \nantitrust  claim  as  a  matter  of  international  comity \nwithout a showing of either severe sanctions or good \nfaith,  the  Second  Circuit’s  abstention  doctrine \neffectively  makes  the  more  limited  doctrine  of \nforeign sovereign compulsion obsolete. \n\nThis  Court  has  also  emphasized  the  limits  of \nthe act of state doctrine. That doctrine provides that, \n“[i]n  the  absence  of  a  treaty  or  other  unambiguous \nagreement  regarding  controlling  legal  principles, \ncourts in the United States will assume the validity \nof  the  official  act  of  a  foreign  sovereign  performed \nwithin  its  own  territory.”  Restatement  (Fourth)  of \nForeign  Relations  Law  of  the  United  States: \nJurisdiction § 221(1) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft \nNo.  2,  2016).  This  Court  unanimously  held  in \nKirkpatrick  that  the  act  of  state  doctrine  applies \nonly  when  a  suit  “requires  the  Court  to  declare \ninvalid, and thus ineffective as ‘a rule of decision for \nthe courts of this country,’ the official act of a foreign \nsovereign.”  493  U.S.  at  405  (quoting  Ricaud  v. \nAmerican Metal Co.,  246  U.S.  304,  310  (1918)). \nKirkpatrick  emphasized  that  “[t]he  act  of  state \ndoctrine  is  not  some  vague  doctrine  of  abstention.” \nId. at 406.  \n\n19",
        "The  Second  Circuit’s  comity  balancing  test  is \nprecisely  the  sort  of  “vague  doctrine  of  abstention” \nthat  this  Court  rejected  in Kirkpatrick. Id.  at  406. \nAlthough  the  court  of  appeals  did  not  reach \nrespondents’  act  of  state  defense,  Vitamin C,  837 \nF.3d at 194, the court did rely on one of its own pre-\nKirkpatrick  act  of  state  decisions  to  support  the \ncomity  balancing  analysis.  In  considering  the \nrelevance of respondents’ conduct in establishing the \nChinese  export  regime,  the  Second  Circuit  reasoned \nthat  “inquiring into  the  motives  behind  the  Chinese \nGovernment’s  decision  to  regulate  the  vitamin  C \nmarket in the way it did is barred by the act of state \ndoctrine.”  Id.  at  191  (citing  O.N.E. Shipping,  830 \nF.2d  at  452).  Under Kirkpatrick,  however,  the  fact \nthat  a  claim  requires  “imputing  to  foreign  officials” \neven  “an  unlawful  motivation,”  493  U.S.  at  401,  is \nnot  sufficient  to  invoke  the  act  of  state  doctrine, \nwhich  applies  only  when  a  suit  “requires  the  Court \nto  declare  invalid,  and  thus  ineffective  as  ‘a  rule  of \ndecision for the courts of this country,’ the official act \nof  a  foreign  sovereign.” Id.  at  405  (quoting Ricaud, \n246 U.S. at 310). Under the Second Circuit’s doctrine \nof  abstention,  that  limitation  of  the  act  of  state \ndoctrine  becomes  irrelevant.  Although  the  act  of \nstate doctrine is limited to claims that require a U.S. \ncourt  to  declare  invalid  the  official  act  of  a  foreign \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  discretionary \nsovereign, \nabstention doctrine is not. \n\nAt  the  end  of  its  opinion,  the  Second  Circuit \nnoted: “Because we reverse and remand for dismissal \non  the  basis  of  international  comity,  we  do  not \naddress \nforeign  sovereign \ncompulsion,  or  political  question  defenses.” Vitamin \nC, 837 F.3d at 194. If this Court were to endorse the \nSecond Circuit’s abstention doctrine, this is likely to \n\nthe  act  of  state, \n\n20",
        "increasingly \n\nbecome  an \nfrequent  disposition. \nDiscretionary abstention as a matter of international \ncomity  would  come  to  supplant  the  more  narrowly \ntailored  international-comity  doctrines  that  this \nCourt has developed. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\ncourt  may  abstain \n\nHow  much  weight  to give  the  representations \nof  foreign  governments  about  the  content  of  their \nown laws is a question of international comity, but it \nis  a  question  that  is  separable  from  whether  a \nfederal \nexercising \njurisdiction  on  grounds  of  international  comity.  In \nanswering the question presented, this Court should \nnot  endorse  the  abstention  doctrine  applied  by  the \nSecond  Circuit,  which  conflicts  with  the  decisions  of \nthis Court and threatens to supplant more narrowly \ntailored doctrines of international comity. \n\nfrom \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nJONATHAN S.

The  Ministry  of  Commerce  of  the  People’s \nRepublic  of  China  filed  an  amicus  brief  supporting \nrespondents,  which  represented  that  under  Chinese \nlaw  all  vitamin  C  legally  exported  during  the \nrelevant  time  had  to  be  sold  at  coordinated  prices. \nId.  at  182.

After  a \n\ndismiss  and,  following  discovery,  upon  a  motion  for \nsummary \nfound \nrespondents liable for violating the Sherman Act, the \ndistrict  court  awarded  petitioners  approximately \n$147  million  in  damages  and  permanently  enjoined \nrespondents  from  further  violations  of  the  Sherman \nAct. Id. \n\njury \n\nOn  appeal,  the  Second  Circuit  declined  to \naddress  the  act  of  state  doctrine  or  the  doctrine  of \nforeign sovereign compulsion. Id. at 194. Instead, the \ncourt of appeals held that “principles of international \ncomity  required  the  district  court  to  abstain  from \nexercising  jurisdiction  in  this  case.” Id.  at  179.  The \ncourt  of  appeals  applied  a  “multi-factor  balancing \ntest,”  id.  at  184-85,  developed  by  the  Ninth  and \nThird Circuits in Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of \nAm., N.T. & S.A.,  549  F.2d  597,  614-15  (9th  Cir. \n1976),  and  Mannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum \nCorp.,  595  F.2d  1287,  1297-98  (3d  Cir.  1979).  The \nSecond Circuit read this Court’s decision in Hartford \nFire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993), \nas  establishing  a  prerequisite  to  any  such  analysis: \nthat complying with both U.S. and foreign law would \nbe  impossible.  Vitamin C,  837  F.3d  at  185-86.  To \nanswer  that  preliminary  question,  the  court  of \nappeals had to determine the content of Chinese law \nand thus “the amount of deference that we extend to \nthe  Chinese  Government’s  explanation  of  its  own \nlaws.” Id.  at  186. The  court  held  that  it  was  “bound \nthe  Chinese  Government’s \nto \nto \nrepresentations.  Id.  at  189. \nthat \nIt \nrespondents  could  not  comply  with  both  U.S.  and \nChinese law, id. at 192, and after weighing the other \nfactors  in  its  multi-factor  test,  the  court  of  appeals \nits \nconcluded  that  “the  district  court  abused \ndiscretion  by  failing  to  abstain  on  international \n\ndefer” \n\nfound \n\n2\n\n \n\fcomity  grounds  from  asserting  jurisdiction.”  Id.  at \n194. \n\nin \n\nerred \n\ntreating \n\nPetitioners  filed  a  petition  for  certiorari \npresenting  three  questions:  (1)  whether  the  court  of \nappeals  erred  in  reviewing  the  motion  to  dismiss \nrather than the final judgment; (2) whether the court \nthe  Chinese \nof  appeals \nGovernment’s  representation  as  conclusive;  and  (3) \nwhether the court of appeals erred in holding that it \ncould  abstain  from  exercising  jurisdiction  on  a  case-\nby-case basis. In response to this Court’s call for the \nviews  of  the  United  States,  the  Solicitor  General \nrecommended that the petition be granted limited to \nthe  second  question  presented,  noting  possible \nprocedural  problems  with  the \nfirst  and  third \nquestions.  This  Court  granted  certiorari  limited  to \nthe second question in the petition. \n\nto  answer \n\nIn  answering  that  question,  the  Court  should \ntake  care  not  to  endorse  the  Second  Circuit’s \ndoctrine of abstention based on international comity. \nFirst, as this Court acknowledged when it limited its \ngrant  to  the  second  question,  it  is  not  necessary  to \naddress  abstention \nthe  question \npresented.  The  principle  of  international  comity  is \nthe  foundation  for  many  doctrines  of  U.S.  law,  each \nof  which  has  specific  requirements  tailored  to  a \nparticular  context.  How  much  weight  a  U.S.  court \nshould  give  as  a  matter  of  international  comity  to \nthe representation of a foreign government about the \ncontent  of  its  own  law  is  a  separate  question  from \nwhether a U.S. court should be allowed to dismiss a \ncase over which it has subject matter jurisdiction on \nthe basis of international comity.  \n\nSecond,  the  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine  of \nabstention  based  on  international  comity  conflicts \n\n3\n\n \n\f(2010) \n\n(2016) \n\n(criticizing \n\nwith  the  decisions  of  this  Court  and  threatens  to \nsupplant  more  narrowly \ntailored  doctrines  of \ninternational  comity.  Viewed  as  a  doctrine  of \nprescriptive  comity,  the  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine \nconflicts  with  this  Court’s  decisions  finding  that  a \ncase-by-case  balancing  approach  is  “too  complex  to \nprove  workable.”  F.  Hoffmann-La  Roche  Ltd.  v. \nEmpagran S.A.,  542  U.S.  155,  168  (2004); see also \nRJR Nabisco, Inc. v. European Community,  136  S. \nCt.  2090,  2108 \n(rejecting  “case-by-case \ninquiry”); Morrison v. National Australia Bank Ltd., \n561  U.S.  247,  259 \nthe \n“methodology  of  balancing  interests”).  Viewed  as  a \ndoctrine  of  adjudicative  comity,  the  Second  Circuit’s \ndoctrine  runs  against  the  “virtually  unflagging \nobligation  of  the  federal  courts  to  exercise  the \njurisdiction  given  them.”  Colorado  River  Water \nConservation Dist. v. United States,  424  U.S.  800, \n817  (1976).  The  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine  also \nthreatens  to  supplant  more  narrowly  tailored \ndoctrines  of  international  comity,  such  as  the \ndoctrine of foreign sovereign compulsion and the act \nof state doctrine that were raised below in this case. \nThis  Court  has  carefully  placed  limits  on  each  of \nthose doctrines, limits that would effectively become \nirrelevant  if  this  Court  were  to  endorse  the  broad \ndoctrine  of  abstention  that  the  Second  Circuit \napplied.  \n\nHaving  granted  certiorari \n\nlimited  to  the \nsecond question presented, this Court should answer \nthat  question  only  and  should  not  prejudge  any  of \nthe other comity questions raised by this case. \n\n4\n\n \n \n \n\fARGUMENT \n\nI. \n\nIT IS NOT NECESSARY TO ADDRESS \nABSTENTION BASED ON \nINTERNATIONAL COMITY IN ORDER TO \nANSWER THE QUESTION PRESENTED \n\nof  doctrines  based \n\nAs  argued  to  the  courts  below,  this  case \ninvolves  a  number \non \ninternational  comity.  Those  doctrines  include  the \nthree defenses raised by respondents and  addressed \nby  the  district  court:  the  act  of  state  doctrine,  the \ndoctrine  of \nforeign  sovereign  compulsion,  and \nabstention  based  on  international  comity.  They  also \ninclude the recognition of foreign law, and as part of \nthat  analysis,  the  question  presented  in  this  case  of \nwhat  deference  to  give  a  foreign  government’s \nrepresentations in determining the content of foreign \nlaw.  The  Second  Circuit  answered  the  question \npresented  in  the  context  of  applying  a  doctrine  of \nabstention  based  on  international  comity.  But  those \ntwo  comity  questions  are  distinct,  and  it  is  not \nnecessary for this Court to address abstention based \non  international  comity  in  order  to  answer  the \nquestion presented.  \n\n“International  comity  reflects  deference  to \nforeign  states  that  international  law  does  not \nmandate.”  Restatement \nof  Foreign \nRelations  Law  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction \n§ 101  cmt.  a  (Am.

Earle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, \n589 (1839) (“[T]he laws of one [country], will, by the \ncomity  of  nations,  be  recognized  and  executed  in \nanother  .  .  .  .”),  and  under  the  act  of  state  doctrine, \nsee, e.g., Oetjen v.

Amici  take  no \nposition  on  the  question  presented,  but  they  note \nthat  it  is  a  separate  comity  question  from  the \nquestion  whether  a  federal  court  may  abstain  from \nexercising jurisdiction based on international comity. \nHaving  granted  certiorari  limited  to  the  second \nquestion  presented,  this  Court  should  answer  that \nquestion  only  and  should  not  prejudge  any  of  the \nother comity questions raised by this case. \n\ninternational \n\nlaw  but \n\n8\n\n \n \n \n\fII. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S DOCTRINE OF \nABSTENTION BASED ON \nINTERNATIONAL COMITY CONFLICTS \nWITH THE DECISIONS OF THIS COURT \nAND THREATENS TO SUPPLANT MORE \nNARROWLY TAILORED DOCTRINES OF \nINTERNATIONAL COMITY \n\nThis  Court  should  be  particularly  careful  not \nto endorse the Second Circuit’s doctrine of abstention \nbased  on  international  comity  because  that  doctrine \nconflicts  with  the  decisions  of  this  Court  and \nthreatens  to  supplant  more  narrowly  tailored \ndoctrines of international comity. \n\nA. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S \nABSTENTION DOCTRINE \nCONFLICTS WITH THE DECISIONS \nOF THIS COURT \n\nthe  motion \n\nIt  is  not  entirely  clear  whether  the  court  of \nappeals  decided \nto  abstain  as  a  matter  of \nprescriptive  comity  or  adjudicative  comity.  On  the \none  hand,  the  court  of  appeals  reviewed  the  district \ncourt’s  denial  of \nto  dismiss  on \ninternational comity grounds for abuse of discretion, \nVitamin C,  837  F.3d  at  183,  which  is  typically  the \nstandard  of  review  for  doctrines  of  adjudicative \ncomity.  See, e.g.,  Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno,  454 \nU.S.  246,  257  (1981)  (adopting  abuse  of  discretion \nstandard  for  forum non conveniens);  Royal & Sun \nAll. Ins. Co. of Canada v.

See Royal & Sun All. Ins.,  466  F.3d  at \n93 (relying on Colorado River, 424 U.S. 800). Most of the other \ncircuits to have adopted this doctrine also require a showing of \npending  and  parallel  foreign  proceedings  and  exceptional \ncircumstances  justifying  dismissal. See Answers in Genesis of \nKentucky, Inc. v. Creation Ministries Int’l, Ltd.,  556 F.3d 459, \n466-69  (6th  Cir.  2009);  Gross  v.  German  Found.

Only \nthe  Ninth  and  Eleventh  Circuits  have  authorized  such \nabstention  in  the  absence  of  a  pending  and  parallel  foreign \nproceeding  and  exceptional  circumstances.

It.), \n2012  I.C.J.  97,  122  (Feb.  3)  (quoting  North Sea Continental \nShelf (Germ. v. Den.; Germ. v. Neth.),  1969  I.C.J.  3,  44  (Feb. \n20)). Other jurisdictions have not followed a practice of case-by-\ncase  balancing.  See, e.g., A. Ahlström Osakeyhtiö v. Comm’n \n(“Wood Pulp”), 1988 E.C.R. 5193, ¶¶ 19-23 (European Court of \nJustice). In the absence of settled state practice, no customary-\ninternational-law  obligation  can  exist.  For  this  reason,  the \nRestatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law concludes that \n“state  practice  does  not  support  a  requirement  of  case-by-case \nbalancing  to  establish  reasonableness  as  a  matter  of \ninternational  law.”  Restatement  (Fourth)  of  Foreign  Relations \nLaw  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction  § 211  reporters’  note  3 \n(Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2016).  \n\n12\n\n \n                                                 \n\ftest  are  still  relevant  to  an  abstention  analysis.” \nVitamin C, 837 F.3d at 185. In so doing, the court of \nappeals  ignored  this  Court’s  subsequent  decisions, \nwhich  have  repeatedly  disapproved  a  discretionary, \ncase-by-case approach.  \n\nIn Empagran,  an  antitrust  case  governed  by \nthe  Foreign  Trade  Antitrust  Improvements  Act \n(FTAIA),  15  U.S.C.  §  6a,  respondents  argued  that \ncourts  could  take  “account  of  comity  considerations \ncase by case, abstaining where comity considerations \nso  dictate.” Empagran,  542  U.S.  at  168.  This  Court \nrejected that argument, concluding that such a case-\nby-case  approach  was  “too  complex  to  prove \nworkable.”  Id.  As  an  example  of  this  unworkable, \nbalancing  approach,  the  Court  cited  Mannington \nMills, see id.,  one  of  the  two  cases  from  which  the \nits  multi-factor  test.  See \nSecond  Circuit  drew \nVitamin C,  837  F.3d  at  184.  The  FTAIA  does  not \napply  in  the  present  case  because  the  antitrust \nclaims involve import commerce. See 15 U.S.C. § 6a \ntrade  or \n(limiting  FTAIA \ncommerce  “other  than  import  trade  or  import \ncommerce”). But there is no reason to believe that a \ncase-by-case  comity  approach  is  any  more  workable \nin antitrust cases not mediated by the FTAIA.  \n\nto  cases \n\ninvolving \n\nThis  Court  has  rejected  a  case-by-case \nbalancing  approach  to  determine  the  geographic \nscope of other statutes as well. Considering the scope \nof  Securities  Exchange  Act  §  10(b)  in Morrison,  the \nCourt  criticized  the  lower  courts’  “methodology  of \nbalancing interests,” 561 U.S. at 259, which had led \nto “the unpredictable and inconsistent application of \n§  10(b)  to  transnational  cases.” Id.  at  260.  Instead, \nthis  Court  adopted  a  “clear  test”  that  simply  asks \n“whether the purchase or sale is made in the United \nStates,  or  involves  a  security  listed  on  a  domestic \n\n13\n\n \n\fexchange.”  Id.  at  269-70.  In  RJR,  this  Court \nconsidered  the  geographic  scope  of  RICO,  holding \nits  substantive  provisions  apply \nthat  two  of \nextraterritorially  to  the  same  extent  as  RICO’s \nunderlying predicate acts, 136 S. Ct. at 2101-03, and \nthat  RICO’s  private  right  of  action  requires  proof  of \ndomestic injury to business or property. Id. at 2111. \nThe  European  Community  asked  this  Court  to \nconsider the absence of international friction in cases \nwhere \nthemselves  were \n“permit \nplaintiffs,  but \nextraterritorial suits based on a case-by-case inquiry \nthat  turns  on  or  looks  to  the  consent  of  the  affected \nsovereign.” Id. at 2108.  \n\nforeign  governments \n\nthe  Court  refused \n\nto \n\nthat \n\n(noting \n\nThere  may  be  statutes  for  which  additional \ncomity  limitations  are  appropriate  even  if  the \npresumption  against  extraterritoriality  has  been \novercome.  See  Restatement  (Fourth)  of  Foreign \nRelations  Law  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction \n§ 204  cmt.  c  (Am.  Law  Inst.,  Tentative  Draft  No.  3, \nthe  presumption  against \n2017) \nextraterritoriality  “does  not  preclude  U.S.  courts \nfrom  interpreting  a  statute  to  include  other  comity \nlimitations  if  doing  so  is  consistent  with  the  text, \nhistory, and purpose of the provision”). For example, \nsome  courts  of  appeals  have  applied  a  choice-of-law \nanalysis  to  determine  the  applicability  of  the \navoidance  provisions  of  the  Bankruptcy  Code.  See \nFrench v. Liebmann (In re French),  440  F.3d  145, \n152-54  (4th  Cir.  2006); Maxwell Commc’n Corp. v. \nSociete Generale (In re Maxwell Commc’n Corp.), 93 \nF.3d 1036, 1049 (2d Cir. 1996); see also Restatement \n(Fourth)  of  Foreign  Relations  Law  of  the  United \nStates: Jurisdiction § 204 reporters’ note 4 (Am. Law \nInst.,  Tentative  Draft  No.  3,  2017)  (discussing \nbankruptcy cases).  \n\n14\n\n \n\fBut  there \n\nis  no  overarching  doctrine  of \ninternational  comity  that  gives  federal  courts  case-\nspecific  authority  not  to  apply  federal  law  in \ninternational  cases.  See  Restatement  (Fourth)  of \nForeign  Relations  Law  of  the  United  States: \nJurisdiction  §  204  cmt.  a  (Am.  Law  Inst.,  Tentative \nDraft No. 3, 2017) (“Reasonableness is a principle of \nstatutory  interpretation  and  not  a  discretionary \njudicial  authority  to  decline  to  apply  federal  law.”). \nWhat  comity  limitations  are  appropriate  will  vary \nfrom  statute  to  statute. See id.  cmt.  d  (“U.S.  courts \nhave  construed  statutory  provisions  to  include  a \nvariety of other comity limitations depending on the \nthe  particular \ntext,  history,  and  purpose  of \nprovision.”).  In  the  context  of  antitrust  law,  in \nparticular,  this  Court  has  rejected  the  Second \nCircuit’s  approach  as \nto  prove \nworkable.” Empagran, 542 U.S. at 168.  \n\n“too  complex \n\n2. \n\nThe Second Circuit’s \nAbstention Doctrine \nConflicts With This \nCourt’s Adjudicative \nComity Decisions \n\nViewed  as  a  doctrine  of  adjudicative  comity, \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine  runs  against  the \n“virtually unflagging obligation of the federal courts \nto  exercise  the  jurisdiction  given  them.”  Colorado \nRiver,  424  U.S.  at  817; see also Cohens v. Virginia, \n19  U.S.  (6  Wheat.)  264,  404  (1821)  (Marshall,  C.J.) \n(observing that federal courts “have no more right to \ndecline  the  exercise  of  jurisdiction  which  is  given, \nthan  to  usurp  that  which  is  not  given”).  This \nobligation to exercise jurisdiction is subject to certain \nexceptions. Federal courts may decline to hear a case \n“where the relief being sought is equitable in nature \nor  otherwise  discretionary,”  such  as  a  declaratory \n\n15\n\n \n\fjudgment.  Quackenbush v. Allstate Ins. Co.,  517 \nU.S. 706, 721 (1996). In actions at law, federal courts \nmay  stay  their  proceedings  in  deference  to  other \nfederal  courts, see Landis v. N. Am. Co.,  299  U.S. \n248, 254 (1936), and may decline jurisdiction in favor \nof  state  courts  under  narrowly  circumscribed \nabstention  doctrines  and  in  other  “exceptional” \ncircumstances,  Colorado River,  424  U.S.  at  818. \nFederal courts may also decline jurisdiction in favor \nof  foreign  courts  under  the  doctrine  of  forum non \nexists  an \nconveniens,  provided \nalternative  forum.” Piper,  454  U.S.  at  254  n.22; see \nalso Restatement (Fourth) of Foreign Relations Law \nof  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction  §  304  cmt.  i  (Am. \nLaw Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2016) (noting that \n“forum non conveniens is  the  only  doctrine  under \nwhich the Supreme Court has approved dismissal in \nfavor of foreign courts”).  \n\n“there \n\nthat \n\nNone of these exceptions to the federal courts’ \ngeneral  obligation  to  exercise  their \njurisdiction \nthe  abstention  doctrine  based  on \nauthorizes \ninternational comity that the Second Circuit applied \nin  this  case.  Petitioners’  Sherman  Act  claim  was  an \naction  for  damages,  although  the  district  court  also \ngranted injunctive relief. The Second Circuit did not \nabstain  in  favor  of  another  federal  or  state  court. \nRespondents  did  not  seek  dismissal  under  the \ndoctrine  of  forum  non  conveniens.  Indeed,  the \nSecond  Circuit  conceded  that  petitioners  “may  be \nunable  to  obtain  a  remedy  for  Sherman  Act \nviolations in another forum.” Vitamin C, 837 F.3d at \nthat \n193.  The \n“complaints  as  to  China’s  export  policies  can \nadequately  be  addressed \nthrough  diplomatic \nchannels  and  the  World  Trade  Organization’s \nprocesses,”  id.,  ignores  petitioners’  rights  to  seek \n\ncourt  of  appeals’  suggestion \n\n16\n\n \n\fcompensation  for  antitrust  injuries  under  federal \nlaw  and  the  federal  court’s  obligations  to  decide \nthose  claims.  As  Justice  Scalia  noted,  writing  for  a \nunanimous  Court  in  W.S.  Kirkpatrick  &  Co.  v. \nEnvironmental Tectonics Corp., Int’l,  493  U.S.  400 \n(1990),  “[t]he  short  of  the  matter  is  this:  Courts  in \nthe United States have the power, and ordinarily the \nobligation, to decide cases and controversies properly \npresented to them.” Id. at 409. \n\nB. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S \nABSTENTION DOCTRINE \nTHREATENS TO SUPPLANT MORE \nNARROWLY TAILORED DOCTRINES \nOF INTERNATIONAL COMITY \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  doctrine  threatens  to \nsupplant  more  narrowly \ntailored  doctrines  of \ninternational  comity, such  as  the  doctrine  of  foreign \nsovereign  compulsion  and  the  act  of  state  doctrine \nthat  were  raised  below  in  this  case.  This  Court  has \ncarefully  placed  limits  on  each  of  those  doctrines, \nlimits that would effectively become irrelevant if this \nCourt were to endorse the doctrine of abstention that \nthe Second Circuit applied. \n\nThis  Court  has  recognized  the  doctrine  of \nforeign  sovereign  compulsion  in  the  context  of  U.S. \ncourt  orders  for  the  production  of  evidence.  See \nInternationale  pour  Participation \nSociete \nIndustrielles et Commerciales, S.A. v. Rogers,  357 \nU.S.  197  (1958).  Rogers  held  that  dismissal  of  a \ncomplaint  was \nfor \ntoo  harsh \nnoncompliance  with  a  pretrial  production  order \n“when it has been established that failure to comply \nhas been due to inability, and not to willfulness, bad \nfaith,  or  any  fault  of  petitioner.”  Id.  at  212.  This \nCourt  has  not  found  it  necessary  to  decide  whether \n\nsanction \n\na \n\n17\n\n \n\fforeign  sovereign  compulsion  is  a  valid  defense  to \nantitrust  claims, see Hartford Fire,  509  U.S.  at  799 \n(noting  that  compliance  with  both  U.S.  and  foreign \nlaw  was  not  “impossible”); Matsushita Elec. Indus. \nCo., Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp.,  475  U.S.  574,  598 \n(1986) (“Our decision makes it unnecessary to reach \nthe  sovereign  compulsion  issue.”);  Continental Ore \nCo. v. Union Carbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, \n706-07  (1962)  (noting  that  there  was  “nothing  to \nindicate  that  [Canadian]  law  in  any  way  compelled \ndiscriminatory  purchasing”),  but  lower  courts  have \nrecognized  the  doctrine  as  a  defense  in  antitrust \ncases. See, e.g., Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1293-\n94;  Trugman-Nash, Inc. v. N.Z. Dairy Bd.,  954  F. \nSupp.  733,  736  (S.D.N.Y.  1997);  Interamerican \nRefining Corp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc.,  307  F. \nSupp.  1291,  1304 \n(D.  Del.  1970);  see  also \nDepartment of Justice & Federal Trade Commission, \nAntitrust  Guidelines  for  International  Enforcement \nand  Cooperation  §  4.2.2  (2017)  (recognizing  foreign \nsovereign  compulsion  defense  to  antitrust  claims). \nWhere courts have recognized the doctrine of foreign \nsovereign  compulsion,  they  have  generally  imposed \ntwo  requirements:  (1)  that  “the  person  in  question \nappears likely to suffer severe sanctions for failing to \ncomply with foreign law”; and (2) that “the person in \nquestion  has  acted  in  good  faith  to  avoid  the \nconflict.”  Restatement  (Fourth)  of  Foreign  Relations \nLaw  of  the  United  States:  Jurisdiction  §  222  (Am. \nLaw Inst., Tentative Draft No. 2, 2016).  \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  discretionary  abstention \ndoctrine  would  supplant  the  more  narrowly  tailored \ndoctrine  of  foreign  sovereign  compulsion.  Before \nabstaining  on  grounds  of  international  comity,  the \ncourt  of  appeals  did  not  require  a  showing  that \nlikely  to  suffer  severe \nrespondents  would  be \n\n18\n\n \n\fsanctions  or  even  that  respondents’  conduct  had \nbeen  compelled.  Instead,  the  court  held  that  “[e]ven \nif Defendants’ specific conduct was not compelled by \n[Chinese  law],  that  type  of  compulsion  is  not \nrequired”  under  the  comity  balancing  test. Vitamin \nC, 837 F.3d at 192. Neither did the court of appeals \nrequire  a  showing  that  respondents  had  acted  in \ngood  faith  to  avoid  the  conflict.  Instead,  the  court \nheld  that  “[w]hether  Defendants  had  a  hand  in  the \nChinese  government’s  decision  to  mandate  some \nlevel  of  price-fixing  is  irrelevant”  under  the  test  it \napplied.  Id.  at  191.  By  allowing  dismissal  of  an \nantitrust  claim  as  a  matter  of  international  comity \nwithout a showing of either severe sanctions or good \nfaith,  the  Second  Circuit’s  abstention  doctrine \neffectively  makes  the  more  limited  doctrine  of \nforeign sovereign compulsion obsolete. \n\nThis  Court  has  also  emphasized  the  limits  of \nthe act of state doctrine. That doctrine provides that, \n“[i]n  the  absence  of  a  treaty  or  other  unambiguous \nagreement  regarding  controlling  legal  principles, \ncourts in the United States will assume the validity \nof  the  official  act  of  a  foreign  sovereign  performed \nwithin  its  own  territory.”  Restatement  (Fourth)  of \nForeign  Relations  Law  of  the  United  States: \nJurisdiction § 221(1) (Am. Law Inst., Tentative Draft \nNo.  2,  2016).  This  Court  unanimously  held  in \nKirkpatrick  that  the  act  of  state  doctrine  applies \nonly  when  a  suit  “requires  the  Court  to  declare \ninvalid, and thus ineffective as ‘a rule of decision for \nthe courts of this country,’ the official act of a foreign \nsovereign.”  493  U.S.  at  405  (quoting  Ricaud  v. \nAmerican Metal Co.,  246  U.S.  304,  310  (1918)). \nKirkpatrick  emphasized  that  “[t]he  act  of  state \ndoctrine  is  not  some  vague  doctrine  of  abstention.” \nId. at 406.  \n\n19\n\n \n\fThe  Second  Circuit’s  comity  balancing  test  is \nprecisely  the  sort  of  “vague  doctrine  of  abstention” \nthat  this  Court  rejected  in Kirkpatrick. Id.  at  406. \nAlthough  the  court  of  appeals  did  not  reach \nrespondents’  act  of  state  defense,  Vitamin C,  837 \nF.3d at 194, the court did rely on one of its own pre-\nKirkpatrick  act  of  state  decisions  to  support  the \ncomity  balancing  analysis.  In  considering  the \nrelevance of respondents’ conduct in establishing the \nChinese  export  regime,  the  Second  Circuit  reasoned \nthat  “inquiring into  the  motives  behind  the  Chinese \nGovernment’s  decision  to  regulate  the  vitamin  C \nmarket in the way it did is barred by the act of state \ndoctrine.”  Id.  at  191  (citing  O.N.E. Shipping,  830 \nF.2d  at  452).  Under Kirkpatrick,  however,  the  fact \nthat  a  claim  requires  “imputing  to  foreign  officials” \neven  “an  unlawful  motivation,”  493  U.S.  at  401,  is \nnot  sufficient  to  invoke  the  act  of  state  doctrine, \nwhich  applies  only  when  a  suit  “requires  the  Court \nto  declare  invalid,  and  thus  ineffective  as  ‘a  rule  of \ndecision for the courts of this country,’ the official act \nof  a  foreign  sovereign.” Id.  at  405  (quoting Ricaud, \n246 U.S. at 310). Under the Second Circuit’s doctrine \nof  abstention,  that  limitation  of  the  act  of  state \ndoctrine  becomes  irrelevant.  Although  the  act  of \nstate doctrine is limited to claims that require a U.S. \ncourt  to  declare  invalid  the  official  act  of  a  foreign \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  discretionary \nsovereign, \nabstention doctrine is not. \n\nAt  the  end  of  its  opinion,  the  Second  Circuit \nnoted: “Because we reverse and remand for dismissal \non  the  basis  of  international  comity,  we  do  not \naddress \nforeign  sovereign \ncompulsion,  or  political  question  defenses.” Vitamin \nC, 837 F.3d at 194. If this Court were to endorse the \nSecond Circuit’s abstention doctrine, this is likely to \n\nthe  act  of  state, \n\n20\n\n \n\fincreasingly \n\nbecome  an \nfrequent  disposition. \nDiscretionary abstention as a matter of international \ncomity  would  come  to  supplant  the  more  narrowly \ntailored  international-comity  doctrines  that  this \nCourt has developed. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\ncourt  may  abstain \n\nHow  much  weight  to give  the  representations \nof  foreign  governments  about  the  content  of  their \nown laws is a question of international comity, but it \nis  a  question  that  is  separable  from  whether  a \nfederal \nexercising \njurisdiction  on  grounds  of  international  comity.  In \nanswering the question presented, this Court should \nnot  endorse  the  abstention  doctrine  applied  by  the \nSecond  Circuit,  which  conflicts  with  the  decisions  of \nthis Court and threatens to supplant more narrowly \ntailored doctrines of international comity. \n\nfrom \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nJONATHAN S.
