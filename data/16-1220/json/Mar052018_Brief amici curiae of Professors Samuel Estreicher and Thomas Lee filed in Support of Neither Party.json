        "3 \n\nINTRODUCTION AND  \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThe Second Circuit ruled below that “principles of \ninternational  comity”  required  the  district  court  to \nabstain from exercising jurisdiction in this case. In re \nVitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d 175, 179 (2d \nCir. 2016).  In so doing, the court of appeals applied a \n10-factor  balancing  test  originated  by  the  Third  and \nNinth  Circuits  in  the  late  1970s.    See  id.,  at  184-85 \n(citing Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am., N.T., & \nS.A.,  549  F.2d  597,  614-115 \n(9th  Cir.  1976); \nMannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d \n1287, 1297-98 (3d Cir. 1979)).  If this Court decides the \ncourt  below  erred  by \nthe  Chinese \ngovernment’s  view  of  Chinese  law  as  conclusive  and \nbinding,  then  on  remand  the  lower  court  will  likely \nreplay  the  Timberlane  international  comity  analysis, \nalbeit  with  more  searching  inquiry  into  relevant \nChinese law. \n\ntreating \n\njudicial  abstention \n\nlongstanding  basis  for \n\nInternational comity—according due respect to the \npublic acts or interests of foreign sovereigns—has been \na \nin \n  The  role  of \nsensitive  foreign  relations  cases. \ninternational  comity  has  diminished  with \nthe \ndevelopment of specific judicial doctrines and statutes \nlike the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to mitigate \nthe  risk  that  litigation  in  U.S.  courts  might  damage \nthis \nother  nations.  \nrelations  with \nNevertheless,  given  the  breadth  of  U.S.  courts’ \nadjudicative  jurisdiction,  and  the  myriad  ways  in \nwhich  litigation  in  the  United  States  touches  upon \nforeign relations concerns, principles of international \ncomity  will  continue  to  inform  judicial  analysis  in \nthese sensitive cases.   \n\ncountry’s",
        "4 \n\nThis Court did not grant certiorari on the question \nwhether  a  freestanding  doctrine  of  international \ncomity  abstention  exists.    Every  court  of  appeals  to \nhave  addressed  the  question  has  answered  in  the \naffirmative.  Accordingly, we submit, this Court should \nnot  resolve  the  question it  left open  in  Hartford Fire \nInsurance  Co.  v.  California,  “whether  a  court  with \nSherman  Act  jurisdiction  should  ever  decline  to \nexercise such jurisdiction on grounds of international \ncomity.”  509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993).  Should the Court \nnevertheless reach that issue, it might use this case as \na  vehicle  for  providing  much  needed  guidance  to  the \nlower courts, which have developed an unpredictable, \nmalleable 10-factor balancing test.  \n\nI.  INTERNATIONAL COMITY IS AN \n\nIMPORTANT BASIS FOR JUDICIAL \nABSTENTION IN SENSITIVE CASES \nIMPLICATING THE PUBLIC ACTS OR \nINTERESTS OF FOREIGN STATES.  \n\nforeign \n\nsovereigns—it  has \n\nAlthough the basic idea of “international comity” is \nsimple—to  accord  respect  to  the  public  acts  or \ninterests  of \nthree \noverlapping legal usages that have sown confusion in \nU.S. courts.  First, comity is sometimes invoked as a \nrule  of  statutory  construction  by  which  “this  Court \nordinarily  construes  ambiguous  statutes  to  avoid \nunreasonable \nsovereign \ninterference  with \nauthority of other nations.”  F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. \nv.  Empagran  S.A.,  542  U.S.  155,  164  (2004).    This \nusage  is  a  cousin  of  the  presumption  against \nextraterritoriality,  which  in  significant  part  is \nmotivated  by  a  desire  “to  avoid  the  international \ndiscord that can result when U.S. law is applied to \n\nthe",
        "5 \n\nconduct  in  foreign  countries.”    RJR  Nabisco,  Inc.  v. \nEuropean Community, 136 S. Ct. 2090, 2100 (2016).  The \nlatter  usage  of  the  term  does  not  apply  in  the  present \ncase,  because  this  Court  has  ruled  that  the  Sherman \nAntitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7, as amended \n(“Sherman Act”), applies extraterritorially to price-fixing \nactivities  abroad  that  affect  “imports  to  the  United \nStates”. Empagran, 542 U.S. at 161. \n\nSecond,  comity  is  an  umbrella  term  or  animating \nprinciple for a number of related doctrines this Court \nhas developed to ensure restraint or respect for foreign \nstate parties or interests in suits in U.S. courts.  For \ninstance,  this  Court  has  recognized  that  “under \nprinciples of comity governing this country’s relations \nwith other nations, sovereign states are allowed to sue” \nin  U.S.  courts.  Banco  Nacional  de  Cuba  v.  Sabbatino, \n376 U.S. 398, 408-409 (1964). The Sabbatino Court also \nacknowledged  that  the  “act  of  state”  doctrine—“the \nprinciple  that  the  conduct  of  one \nindependent \ngovernment  cannot  be  successfully  questioned  in  the \ncourts  of  another”—rests  upon \n“the  highest \nconsideration of international comity and expediency.”  \nId. at 417 (quoting Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 \nU.S. 297, 303-304 (1918)).  Other prominent doctrines \nimplicating  international  comity  are  found  in  cases \ndealing  with  conflict  of  laws,  see  Bank  of  Augusta  v. \nEarle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 589 (1839) (one country’s \nlaws “will, by the comity of nations, be recognized an \nexecuted in another”); recognition of foreign judgments \nin  American  courts,  see  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.S.  113, \n163-4 (1895) (“The extent to which the law of one nation, \nas put in force within its territory . . . by judicial decree, \nshall  be  allowed  to  operate  within  the  dominion  of \nanother  nation,  depends  upon  . . .  ‘the  comity  of \nnations’”);  and  constitutional  limitations  on  personal \njurisdiction over foreign corporations, see Daimler AG",
        "6 \n\nv.  Bauman,  134  S.  Ct.  746,  763  (2014)  (U.S.  courts’ \n“expansive view of general jurisdiction” poses “risks to \ninternational comity”). \n\nThird,  and  most  relevant  for  present  purposes, \nvarious  courts  of  appeals  have  recognized  inter-\nnational  comity  as  an  independent  basis  for  judicial \nabstention in sensitive foreign relations cases, as the \nSecond Circuit did in this case.  See, e.g., Mannington \nMills,  Inc.  v.  Congoleum  Corp.,  595  F.2d  1287,  1297-\n1298 (3d Cir. 1979); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of \nAm., 549 F.2d 597, 613-615 (9th Cir. 1976).  No federal \nappeals  court  has  held  that  international  comity \ncannot be the basis for abstention in appropriate cases. \nAlthough  the  circuits  have  not  developed  a  uniform \ninternational  comity  analysis,  it  is  generally  agreed \nthat U.S. courts “should not apply the antitrust laws \nto foreign conduct or foreign actors if such application \nwould  violate  principles  of  comity.”  Industrial  Inv. \nDev.  Corp.  v.  Mitsui  &  Co.,  671  F.2d  876,  884  &  n.7 \n(5th  Cir.  1982),  vacated  on  other  grounds,  460  U.S. \n1007 (1983). \n\nThis Court has not decided the question “whether \na  court  with  Sherman  Act  jurisdiction  should  ever \ndecline  to  exercise  such  jurisdiction  on  grounds  of \ninternational  comity.”  Hartford Fire  Insurance  Co.  v. \nCalifornia,  509  U.S.  764,  798  (1993).    The  Hartford \nFire  majority  explicitly  left  the  question  open.    This \nCourt’s  holding  in  United  States.  F.  Hoffmann-La \nRoche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A. 542 U.S. 155 (2004), did \nnot purport to address the comity abstention question \nleft  open  in  Hartford  Fire.    Rather,  the  Empagran \nCourt  construed  Section  402  of  the  Foreign  Trade \nAntitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA), 18 Pub. \nL. No. 97-290, Tit. IV, 96 Stat 1246, 15 U.S.C. § 6a, to \nnot  reach  “commercial  activities  taking  place  abroad, \nunless  those  activities  adversely  affect  domestic",
        "7 \n\ncommerce”  or  “imports  to  the  United  States”. \nEmpagran 542 U.S. at 161. In other words, Empagran \ninvolved  a  construction  of  the  Sherman  Act’s  extra-\nterritorial  reach \n(what  some  call  “prescriptive \ncomity”), not the issue of whether a U.S. court having \nadjudicative jurisdiction should dismiss or stay a case \non  international  comity  grounds  (what  might  be \ntermed  “adjudicative comity”).  In  fact,  the legislative \nhistory of the FTAIA openly acknowledges that these \namendments to federal antitrust laws “would have no \neffect  on  the  courts’  ability  to  employ  notions  of \ncomity.”  H.R.  Rep.  No.  686,  97th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  13 \n(1982). \n\nThe role of international comity as a freestanding \ndoctrine  has  diminished  with  the  development  of \njudicial  doctrines  (like  act-of-state)  and  statutes \ndeveloped  to  mitigate  the  risk  that  litigation  in  U.S. \ncourts  might  damage  this  country’s  relations  with \nother  nations.    For instance,  foreign state  immunity, \nhistorically the flagship issue of international comity \nin  national  courts,  has  been  regulated  by  statute  for \nthe  past \nfew  decades—the  Foreign  Sovereign \nImmunities Act of 1976 (“FSIA”), Publ. L. No. 94-583, \n90  Stat.  2891  (28  U.S.C.  §§  1330,  1332,  1391(f), \n1441(d), 1602-11). Chief Justice Marshall’s holding for \nthis  Court  that  a  federal  district  court  could  not \nexercise “ordinary jurisdiction” over a ship alleged to be \n“a national armed vessel . . . of the emperor of France, \nThe Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 8 U.S. (7 Cranch) \n116,  146  (1812),  was  an  early  example  of  adjudicative \n  Under  The  Schooner  Exchange,  “foreign \ncomity. \nsovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity on \nthe  part  of  the  United  States. . . .”    Verlinden  B.V.  v. \nCentral Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 486 (1983). \n\nBut given the breadth of U.S. courts’ adjudicative \njurisdiction, and the myriad ways in which litigation",
        "8 \n\nin \n\nin  the  United  States  touches  upon  foreign  relations, \nprinciples  of  abstention  on  international  comity \ngrounds in sensitive cases continue to inform judicial \ncases.  The  availability  of \nanalysis \nsuch \ninternational  comity  abstention \nis  particularly \nimportant in cases falling outside the limits of specific \nstatutory  provisions  but  where, \ndoctrines  or \nnonetheless,  especially  at  the  suggestion  of  the \nExecutive Branch, foreign relations considerations call \nfor the U.S. court to stay its hand.  \n\nII. THE LOWER COURTS WOULD BENEFIT \nFROM FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE \nPRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD GOVERN \nABSTENTION ON INTERNATIONAL \nCOMITY GROUNDS.  \n\nDespite the importance and continuing need for a \ncomity \nof \nfreestanding  doctrine \nabstention, \nhas \nof \ncriticism \nunderstandably  focused  on  the  malleable  10-factor \nMannington Mills-Timberlane test which most of the \ncourts  of  appeals,  including  the  court  below,  have \napplied to implement it.  These factors include: \n\ninternational \nthe \n\ndoctrine \n\n(1) Degree of conflict with foreign law or policy; (2) \nNationality  of  the  parties,  locations  or  principal \nplaces  of  business  of  corporations;  (3)  Relative \nimportance of the alleged violation of conduct here \nas compared with conduct abroad; (4) The extent \nto  which  enforcement  by  either  state  can  be \nexpected to achieve compliance, the availability of \na  remedy  abroad  and  the  pendency  of  litigation \nthere;  (5)  Existence  of  intent  to  harm  or  affect \nAmerican  commerce  and  its  foreseeability;  (6) \nPossible effect upon foreign relations if the court \nexercises jurisdiction and grants relief; (7) If relief",
        "9 \n\nor \n\ncountry \n\nbe  under \n\nis granted, whether a party will be placed in the \nposition of being forced to perform an act illegal in \nconflicting \neither \nrequirements  by  both  countries;  (8)  whether  the \ncourt can make its order effective; (9) Whether an \norder for relief would be acceptable in this country \nif  made  by  the  foreign  nation  under  similar \ncircumstances; and (10) Whether a treaty with the \naffected nations has addressed the issue. \n\nIn  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litigation,  837  F.3d  175, \n184-85 (2d Cir. 2016); see also Timberlane, 549 F.2d at \n614; Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1297-98. \n\nThis  10-factor  test  is too  indeterminate  and  gives \nvirtually  limitless  discretion  to  lower  courts  to  reach \nany  desired  outcome,  even  to  the  point  of  shirking \ntheir  adjudicative  responsibility.    But  that  does  not \nmean that this Court should throw the proverbial baby \nout  with  the  bathwater.    Rather,  it  could  emphasize \nthe  most  important  factors  in  international  comity \nanalysis and require courts to  engage in a principled \napplication  of  those  factors.    This  Court’s  iconic \ndecision in The Schooner Exchange is a good place to \nstart identifying what those factors are.    \n\nThat case involved a libel filed in federal court by \ntwo American citizens on a ship in Philadelphia under \nSection 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provided \nthat  the  district  courts  “shall  also  have  exclusive \noriginal cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and \nmaritime  jurisdiction.”  Judiciary  Act  of  1789,  ch.  20, \n§ 9,  1  Stat.  73,  77  (1789).  The  American  citizens \nclaimed that they were the rightful owners of the ship \nwhich  had  been  “seized  by  certain  persons,  acting \nunder the decrees and orders of Napoleon, Emperor of \nthe French.”  The Schooner Exchange, 11 U.S. at 117 \n(statement  of  facts).    They  alleged  that  the  ship  had",
        "10 \n\nnever been taken to a French port for condemnation of \ntitle after capture as required under the maritime law \nof prize, an assertion this Court did not challenge.  \n\nNo  one  timely  appeared  to  challenge  the  U.S. \nlibellants’ claim of good title to the ship. Instead, the \nU.S.  Attorney  for  the  District  of  Pennsylvania \nappeared to make a “suggestion” to the effect that the \nship was a “public vessel” of the French Emperor that \nhad taken shelter in the port of Philadelphia during a \nstorm.    Id.  at  117-18.    The  U.S.  Attorney  offered \naffidavits  from  the  local  French  consul  and  ship’s \ncaptain in support of his suggestion.  Id. at 119.   \n\nChief  Justice  Marshall,  writing  for  a  unanimous \nCourt, held that public vessels “entering the port of a \nfriendly power . . . are to be considered as exempted by \nthe consent of that power from its jurisdiction.”  Id. at \n146.    The  Court  thus  adopted  the  U.S.  Attorney’s \n“suggestion”—despite  the  statement  of  the  libellants \nto  the  contrary  and,  more  importantly,  despite  the \nabsence  of  any  statement  by  the  U.S.  Attorney \nrebutting the libellants’ factual assertion that the ship \nhad  not  been  condemned  by  a  French  prize  court  as \nrequired by the maritime law of prize.  \n\nAs indicated by The Schooner Exchange, a critically \nimportant factor in determining whether a U.S. court \nshould  dismiss  (or  stay)  a  case  implicating  foreign \nsovereign  interests  is  the  position  of  the  Executive \nBranch  in  the  matter.    Although  the  Government  in \nthis  case  did  not  urge  this  Court  to  decide  the \ninternational  comity abstention question, its briefing \nin  support  of  the  petitioners  strongly  suggests  its \napproval  of  the  view  that  international  comity \nremains  an  important  ground  for  federal  courts  to \nabstain in sensitive cases implicating foreign affairs \nconcerns.  See  Br.  for  the  United  States  as  Amicus",
        "11 \n\nCuriae, No. 16-1220, at 18 (“Comity-based dismissals [in \nSherman Act cases] should be rare . . . But, in the United \nStates’  view,  federal  courts  may,  in  extraordinary \ncircumstances,  dismiss  private  Sherman  Act  claims \nbased on principles of comity.”). The Executive Branch is \nthe  essential  branch  in  the  conduct  of  this  nation’s \nforeign  relations,  and  courts  should  not  “second-guess \nthe executive branch’s judgment as to the proper role of \ncomity  concerns”  in  government  antitrust  enforcement \nactions. United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 731 F. Supp. \n3, 6 n.5 (D.D.C. 1990).  \n\nAnother  point  of  concern  is  that  the  10-factor \nMannington  Mills-Timberlane  test  does  not  give \nadequate  weight  to  U.S.  regulatory  interests  in \nenforcing  laws  having  an  undisputed  extraterritorial \nreach  and  implicating  serious  U.S.  domestic  effects \nfrom claimed international wrongdoing.  \n\nThis Court has clearly held that “the Sherman Act \napplies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce \nand did in fact produce some substantial effect in the \nUnited  States.”  Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  California, \n509 U.S. 764, 796 (1993).   And it is an axiom of U.S. \nfederal courts law that the courts “have the power, and \nordinarily  the  obligation,  to  decide  cases  and  contro-\nversies properly presented to them.” W.S. Kirkpatrick \n& Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., Int’l, 493 U.S. \n400, 409 (1990). But that obligation, as Chief Justice \nMarshall’s holding in The Schooner Exchange teaches, \nis not absolute.  And despite the welter of statutes and \ndoctrines  that  operationalize  comity,  there  may  be \ninstances in which a federal court should abstain from \nhearing a case over which it plainly has adjudicative \njurisdiction.   \n\nWhat  might  such cases  be?    Two  examples where \ninternational  comity  abstention  seem  particularly",
        "12 \n\nappropriate  are  when:  (1)  the  Executive  Branch \nappears and suggests dismissal in a private Sherman \nAct action, or (2) a U.S. court determines that a foreign \nplaintiff  should  first  exhaust  available  remedies  in \nother  forums  where  the  underlying  events  occurred \nbefore  proceeding  here,  cf.  Sosa  v.  Alvarez–Machain, \n542 U.S. 692, 733 n. 21 (2004), or in a lawsuit against \na foreign state or official not covered by the FSIA, cf. \nSamantar  v.  Yousuf,  560  U.S.  305,  325-326  (2010) \n(noting  that  the  FSIA  “did  not  deprive  the  District \nCourt  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction”  over  a  suit \nagainst  a  foreign  ex-official  but  that  he  “may  be \nentitled to immunity under the common law” or “have \nother valid defenses”). \n\nIn  sum,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  judicial \nabstention on international comity grounds should be \nexceedingly  rare.    For  instance,  if the  United  States, \nnot  private  litigants,  had  brought  the  Sherman  Act \nchallenge  in  this  case,  a  federal  court  should  never \nabstain.    The  government’s  decision  to  bring  an \nenforcement  action  “represents  a  determination  that \nthe  importance  of  antitrust  enforcement  outweighs \nany  relevant  foreign  policy  concerns.”  U.S.  Dep’t  of \nJustice  &  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n,  Antitrust  Guidelines \nfor International Enforcement and Cooperation § 4.1, \nat 28 (2017).",
        "13 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \nnot address the question it left open in Hartford Fire \n“whether a court with Sherman Act jurisdiction should \never decline to exercise such jurisdiction on grounds of \ninternational comity.”  509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993).  If it \ndoes  reach  that  question,  it  might  use  this  case  as a \nvehicle  for  announcing  principles  of  international \ncomity  abstention  that  U.S.  courts  could  invoke  in \nsensitive foreign relations cases. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nSAMUEL ESTREICHER \n   Counsel of Record \nNEW YORK UNIVERSITY  \n   SCHOOL OF LAW \n40 Washington Square South  \nNew York, New York 10012 \n(212) 998-6226 \nsamuel.estreicher@nyu.edu \n\nTHOMAS H.

In re \nVitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d 175, 179 (2d \nCir. 2016).  In so doing, the court of appeals applied a \n10-factor  balancing  test  originated  by  the  Third  and \nNinth  Circuits  in  the  late  1970s.    See  id.,  at  184-85 \n(citing Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am., N.T., & \nS.A.,  549  F.2d  597,  614-115 \n(9th  Cir.  1976); \nMannington Mills, Inc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d \n1287, 1297-98 (3d Cir. 1979)).  If this Court decides the \ncourt  below  erred  by \nthe  Chinese \ngovernment’s  view  of  Chinese  law  as  conclusive  and \nbinding,  then  on  remand  the  lower  court  will  likely \nreplay  the  Timberlane  international  comity  analysis, \nalbeit  with  more  searching  inquiry  into  relevant \nChinese law. \n\ntreating \n\njudicial  abstention \n\nlongstanding  basis  for \n\nInternational comity—according due respect to the \npublic acts or interests of foreign sovereigns—has been \na \nin \n  The  role  of \nsensitive  foreign  relations  cases. \ninternational  comity  has  diminished  with \nthe \ndevelopment of specific judicial doctrines and statutes \nlike the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act to mitigate \nthe  risk  that  litigation  in  U.S.  courts  might  damage \nthis \nother  nations.  \nrelations  with \nNevertheless,  given  the  breadth  of  U.S.  courts’ \nadjudicative  jurisdiction,  and  the  myriad  ways  in \nwhich  litigation  in  the  United  States  touches  upon \nforeign relations concerns, principles of international \ncomity  will  continue  to  inform  judicial  analysis  in \nthese sensitive cases.   \n\ncountry’s \n\n \n\f4 \n\nThis Court did not grant certiorari on the question \nwhether  a  freestanding  doctrine  of  international \ncomity  abstention  exists.    Every  court  of  appeals  to \nhave  addressed  the  question  has  answered  in  the \naffirmative.  Accordingly, we submit, this Court should \nnot  resolve  the  question it  left open  in  Hartford Fire \nInsurance  Co.  v.  California,  “whether  a  court  with \nSherman  Act  jurisdiction  should  ever  decline  to \nexercise such jurisdiction on grounds of international \ncomity.”  509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993).  Should the Court \nnevertheless reach that issue, it might use this case as \na  vehicle  for  providing  much  needed  guidance  to  the \nlower courts, which have developed an unpredictable, \nmalleable 10-factor balancing test.  \n\nI.  INTERNATIONAL COMITY IS AN \n\nIMPORTANT BASIS FOR JUDICIAL \nABSTENTION IN SENSITIVE CASES \nIMPLICATING THE PUBLIC ACTS OR \nINTERESTS OF FOREIGN STATES.  \n\nforeign \n\nsovereigns—it  has \n\nAlthough the basic idea of “international comity” is \nsimple—to  accord  respect  to  the  public  acts  or \ninterests  of \nthree \noverlapping legal usages that have sown confusion in \nU.S. courts.  First, comity is sometimes invoked as a \nrule  of  statutory  construction  by  which  “this  Court \nordinarily  construes  ambiguous  statutes  to  avoid \nunreasonable \nsovereign \ninterference  with \nauthority of other nations.”  F. Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. \nv.  Empagran  S.A.,  542  U.S.  155,  164  (2004).    This \nusage  is  a  cousin  of  the  presumption  against \nextraterritoriality,  which  in  significant  part  is \nmotivated  by  a  desire  “to  avoid  the  international \ndiscord that can result when U.S. law is applied to \n\nthe \n\n \n \n \n\f5 \n\nconduct  in  foreign  countries.”    RJR  Nabisco,  Inc.  v. \nEuropean Community, 136 S. Ct. 2090, 2100 (2016).  The \nlatter  usage  of  the  term  does  not  apply  in  the  present \ncase,  because  this  Court  has  ruled  that  the  Sherman \nAntitrust Act, 26 Stat. 209, 15 U.S.C. §§ 1-7, as amended \n(“Sherman Act”), applies extraterritorially to price-fixing \nactivities  abroad  that  affect  “imports  to  the  United \nStates”. Empagran, 542 U.S. at 161. \n\nSecond,  comity  is  an  umbrella  term  or  animating \nprinciple for a number of related doctrines this Court \nhas developed to ensure restraint or respect for foreign \nstate parties or interests in suits in U.S. courts.  For \ninstance,  this  Court  has  recognized  that  “under \nprinciples of comity governing this country’s relations \nwith other nations, sovereign states are allowed to sue” \nin  U.S.  courts.  Banco  Nacional  de  Cuba  v.  Sabbatino, \n376 U.S. 398, 408-409 (1964). The Sabbatino Court also \nacknowledged  that  the  “act  of  state”  doctrine—“the \nprinciple  that  the  conduct  of  one \nindependent \ngovernment  cannot  be  successfully  questioned  in  the \ncourts  of  another”—rests  upon \n“the  highest \nconsideration of international comity and expediency.”  \nId. at 417 (quoting Oetjen v. Central Leather Co., 246 \nU.S. 297, 303-304 (1918)).  Other prominent doctrines \nimplicating  international  comity  are  found  in  cases \ndealing  with  conflict  of  laws,  see  Bank  of  Augusta  v. \nEarle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 589 (1839) (one country’s \nlaws “will, by the comity of nations, be recognized an \nexecuted in another”); recognition of foreign judgments \nin  American  courts,  see  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.S.  113, \n163-4 (1895) (“The extent to which the law of one nation, \nas put in force within its territory . . . by judicial decree, \nshall  be  allowed  to  operate  within  the  dominion  of \nanother  nation,  depends  upon  . . .  ‘the  comity  of \nnations’”);  and  constitutional  limitations  on  personal \njurisdiction over foreign corporations, see Daimler AG \n\n \n\f6 \n\nv.  Bauman,  134  S.  Ct.  746,  763  (2014)  (U.S.  courts’ \n“expansive view of general jurisdiction” poses “risks to \ninternational comity”). \n\nThird,  and  most  relevant  for  present  purposes, \nvarious  courts  of  appeals  have  recognized  inter-\nnational  comity  as  an  independent  basis  for  judicial \nabstention in sensitive foreign relations cases, as the \nSecond Circuit did in this case.  See, e.g., Mannington \nMills,  Inc.  v.  Congoleum  Corp.,  595  F.2d  1287,  1297-\n1298 (3d Cir. 1979); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of \nAm., 549 F.2d 597, 613-615 (9th Cir. 1976).  No federal \nappeals  court  has  held  that  international  comity \ncannot be the basis for abstention in appropriate cases. \nAlthough  the  circuits  have  not  developed  a  uniform \ninternational  comity  analysis,  it  is  generally  agreed \nthat U.S. courts “should not apply the antitrust laws \nto foreign conduct or foreign actors if such application \nwould  violate  principles  of  comity.”  Industrial  Inv. \nDev.  Corp.  v.  Mitsui  &  Co.,  671  F.2d  876,  884  &  n.7 \n(5th  Cir.  1982),  vacated  on  other  grounds,  460  U.S. \n1007 (1983). \n\nThis Court has not decided the question “whether \na  court  with  Sherman  Act  jurisdiction  should  ever \ndecline  to  exercise  such  jurisdiction  on  grounds  of \ninternational  comity.”  Hartford Fire  Insurance  Co.  v. \nCalifornia,  509  U.S.  764,  798  (1993).    The  Hartford \nFire  majority  explicitly  left  the  question  open.    This \nCourt’s  holding  in  United  States.  F.  Hoffmann-La \nRoche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A. 542 U.S. 155 (2004), did \nnot purport to address the comity abstention question \nleft  open  in  Hartford  Fire.    Rather,  the  Empagran \nCourt  construed  Section  402  of  the  Foreign  Trade \nAntitrust Improvements Act of 1982 (FTAIA), 18 Pub. \nL. No. 97-290, Tit. IV, 96 Stat 1246, 15 U.S.C. § 6a, to \nnot  reach  “commercial  activities  taking  place  abroad, \nunless  those  activities  adversely  affect  domestic \n\n \n\f7 \n\ncommerce”  or  “imports  to  the  United  States”. \nEmpagran 542 U.S. at 161. In other words, Empagran \ninvolved  a  construction  of  the  Sherman  Act’s  extra-\nterritorial  reach \n(what  some  call  “prescriptive \ncomity”), not the issue of whether a U.S. court having \nadjudicative jurisdiction should dismiss or stay a case \non  international  comity  grounds  (what  might  be \ntermed  “adjudicative comity”).  In  fact,  the legislative \nhistory of the FTAIA openly acknowledges that these \namendments to federal antitrust laws “would have no \neffect  on  the  courts’  ability  to  employ  notions  of \ncomity.”  H.R.  Rep.  No.  686,  97th  Cong.,  2d  Sess.  13 \n(1982). \n\nThe role of international comity as a freestanding \ndoctrine  has  diminished  with  the  development  of \njudicial  doctrines  (like  act-of-state)  and  statutes \ndeveloped  to  mitigate  the  risk  that  litigation  in  U.S. \ncourts  might  damage  this  country’s  relations  with \nother  nations.    For instance,  foreign state  immunity, \nhistorically the flagship issue of international comity \nin  national  courts,  has  been  regulated  by  statute  for \nthe  past \nfew  decades—the  Foreign  Sovereign \nImmunities Act of 1976 (“FSIA”), Publ. L. No. 94-583, \n90  Stat.  2891  (28  U.S.C.  §§  1330,  1332,  1391(f), \n1441(d), 1602-11). Chief Justice Marshall’s holding for \nthis  Court  that  a  federal  district  court  could  not \nexercise “ordinary jurisdiction” over a ship alleged to be \n“a national armed vessel . . . of the emperor of France, \nThe Schooner Exchange v. McFaddon, 8 U.S. (7 Cranch) \n116,  146  (1812),  was  an  early  example  of  adjudicative \n  Under  The  Schooner  Exchange,  “foreign \ncomity. \nsovereign immunity is a matter of grace and comity on \nthe  part  of  the  United  States. . . .”    Verlinden  B.V.  v. \nCentral Bank of Nigeria, 461 U.S. 480, 486 (1983). \n\nBut given the breadth of U.S. courts’ adjudicative \njurisdiction, and the myriad ways in which litigation \n\n \n\f8 \n\nin \n\nin  the  United  States  touches  upon  foreign  relations, \nprinciples  of  abstention  on  international  comity \ngrounds in sensitive cases continue to inform judicial \ncases.  The  availability  of \nanalysis \nsuch \ninternational  comity  abstention \nis  particularly \nimportant in cases falling outside the limits of specific \nstatutory  provisions  but  where, \ndoctrines  or \nnonetheless,  especially  at  the  suggestion  of  the \nExecutive Branch, foreign relations considerations call \nfor the U.S. court to stay its hand.  \n\nII. THE LOWER COURTS WOULD BENEFIT \nFROM FURTHER GUIDANCE ON THE \nPRINCIPLES THAT SHOULD GOVERN \nABSTENTION ON INTERNATIONAL \nCOMITY GROUNDS.  \n\nDespite the importance and continuing need for a \ncomity \nof \nfreestanding  doctrine \nabstention, \nhas \nof \ncriticism \nunderstandably  focused  on  the  malleable  10-factor \nMannington Mills-Timberlane test which most of the \ncourts  of  appeals,  including  the  court  below,  have \napplied to implement it.  These factors include: \n\ninternational \nthe \n\ndoctrine \n\n(1) Degree of conflict with foreign law or policy; (2) \nNationality  of  the  parties,  locations  or  principal \nplaces  of  business  of  corporations;  (3)  Relative \nimportance of the alleged violation of conduct here \nas compared with conduct abroad; (4) The extent \nto  which  enforcement  by  either  state  can  be \nexpected to achieve compliance, the availability of \na  remedy  abroad  and  the  pendency  of  litigation \nthere;  (5)  Existence  of  intent  to  harm  or  affect \nAmerican  commerce  and  its  foreseeability;  (6) \nPossible effect upon foreign relations if the court \nexercises jurisdiction and grants relief; (7) If relief \n\n \n\f9 \n\nor \n\ncountry \n\nbe  under \n\nis granted, whether a party will be placed in the \nposition of being forced to perform an act illegal in \nconflicting \neither \nrequirements  by  both  countries;  (8)  whether  the \ncourt can make its order effective; (9) Whether an \norder for relief would be acceptable in this country \nif  made  by  the  foreign  nation  under  similar \ncircumstances; and (10) Whether a treaty with the \naffected nations has addressed the issue. \n\nIn  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litigation,  837  F.3d  175, \n184-85 (2d Cir. 2016); see also Timberlane, 549 F.2d at \n614; Mannington Mills, 595 F.2d at 1297-98. \n\nThis  10-factor  test  is too  indeterminate  and  gives \nvirtually  limitless  discretion  to  lower  courts  to  reach \nany  desired  outcome,  even  to  the  point  of  shirking \ntheir  adjudicative  responsibility.    But  that  does  not \nmean that this Court should throw the proverbial baby \nout  with  the  bathwater.    Rather,  it  could  emphasize \nthe  most  important  factors  in  international  comity \nanalysis and require courts to  engage in a principled \napplication  of  those  factors.    This  Court’s  iconic \ndecision in The Schooner Exchange is a good place to \nstart identifying what those factors are.    \n\nThat case involved a libel filed in federal court by \ntwo American citizens on a ship in Philadelphia under \nSection 9 of the Judiciary Act of 1789, which provided \nthat  the  district  courts  “shall  also  have  exclusive \noriginal cognizance of all civil causes of admiralty and \nmaritime  jurisdiction.”  Judiciary  Act  of  1789,  ch.  20, \n§ 9,  1  Stat.  73,  77  (1789).  The  American  citizens \nclaimed that they were the rightful owners of the ship \nwhich  had  been  “seized  by  certain  persons,  acting \nunder the decrees and orders of Napoleon, Emperor of \nthe French.”  The Schooner Exchange, 11 U.S. at 117 \n(statement  of  facts).    They  alleged  that  the  ship  had \n\n \n\f10 \n\nnever been taken to a French port for condemnation of \ntitle after capture as required under the maritime law \nof prize, an assertion this Court did not challenge.  \n\nNo  one  timely  appeared  to  challenge  the  U.S. \nlibellants’ claim of good title to the ship. Instead, the \nU.S.  Attorney  for  the  District  of  Pennsylvania \nappeared to make a “suggestion” to the effect that the \nship was a “public vessel” of the French Emperor that \nhad taken shelter in the port of Philadelphia during a \nstorm.    Id.  at  117-18.    The  U.S.  Attorney  offered \naffidavits  from  the  local  French  consul  and  ship’s \ncaptain in support of his suggestion.  Id. at 119.   \n\nChief  Justice  Marshall,  writing  for  a  unanimous \nCourt, held that public vessels “entering the port of a \nfriendly power . . . are to be considered as exempted by \nthe consent of that power from its jurisdiction.”  Id. at \n146.    The  Court  thus  adopted  the  U.S.  Attorney’s \n“suggestion”—despite  the  statement  of  the  libellants \nto  the  contrary  and,  more  importantly,  despite  the \nabsence  of  any  statement  by  the  U.S.  Attorney \nrebutting the libellants’ factual assertion that the ship \nhad  not  been  condemned  by  a  French  prize  court  as \nrequired by the maritime law of prize.  \n\nAs indicated by The Schooner Exchange, a critically \nimportant factor in determining whether a U.S. court \nshould  dismiss  (or  stay)  a  case  implicating  foreign \nsovereign  interests  is  the  position  of  the  Executive \nBranch  in  the  matter.    Although  the  Government  in \nthis  case  did  not  urge  this  Court  to  decide  the \ninternational  comity abstention question, its briefing \nin  support  of  the  petitioners  strongly  suggests  its \napproval  of  the  view  that  international  comity \nremains  an  important  ground  for  federal  courts  to \nabstain in sensitive cases implicating foreign affairs \nconcerns.  See  Br.  for  the  United  States  as  Amicus \n\n \n\f11 \n\nCuriae, No. 16-1220, at 18 (“Comity-based dismissals [in \nSherman Act cases] should be rare . . . But, in the United \nStates’  view,  federal  courts  may,  in  extraordinary \ncircumstances,  dismiss  private  Sherman  Act  claims \nbased on principles of comity.”). The Executive Branch is \nthe  essential  branch  in  the  conduct  of  this  nation’s \nforeign  relations,  and  courts  should  not  “second-guess \nthe executive branch’s judgment as to the proper role of \ncomity  concerns”  in  government  antitrust  enforcement \nactions. United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 731 F. Supp. \n3, 6 n.5 (D.D.C. 1990).  \n\nAnother  point  of  concern  is  that  the  10-factor \nMannington  Mills-Timberlane  test  does  not  give \nadequate  weight  to  U.S.  regulatory  interests  in \nenforcing  laws  having  an  undisputed  extraterritorial \nreach  and  implicating  serious  U.S.  domestic  effects \nfrom claimed international wrongdoing.  \n\nThis Court has clearly held that “the Sherman Act \napplies to foreign conduct that was meant to produce \nand did in fact produce some substantial effect in the \nUnited  States.”  Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  California, \n509 U.S. 764, 796 (1993).   And it is an axiom of U.S. \nfederal courts law that the courts “have the power, and \nordinarily  the  obligation,  to  decide  cases  and  contro-\nversies properly presented to them.” W.S. Kirkpatrick \n& Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., Int’l, 493 U.S. \n400, 409 (1990). But that obligation, as Chief Justice \nMarshall’s holding in The Schooner Exchange teaches, \nis not absolute.  And despite the welter of statutes and \ndoctrines  that  operationalize  comity,  there  may  be \ninstances in which a federal court should abstain from \nhearing a case over which it plainly has adjudicative \njurisdiction.   \n\nWhat  might  such cases  be?    Two  examples where \ninternational  comity  abstention  seem  particularly \n\n \n\f12 \n\nappropriate  are  when:  (1)  the  Executive  Branch \nappears and suggests dismissal in a private Sherman \nAct action, or (2) a U.S. court determines that a foreign \nplaintiff  should  first  exhaust  available  remedies  in \nother  forums  where  the  underlying  events  occurred \nbefore  proceeding  here,  cf.  Sosa  v.  Alvarez–Machain, \n542 U.S. 692, 733 n. 21 (2004), or in a lawsuit against \na foreign state or official not covered by the FSIA, cf. \nSamantar  v.  Yousuf,  560  U.S.  305,  325-326  (2010) \n(noting  that  the  FSIA  “did  not  deprive  the  District \nCourt  of  subject-matter  jurisdiction”  over  a  suit \nagainst  a  foreign  ex-official  but  that  he  “may  be \nentitled to immunity under the common law” or “have \nother valid defenses”). \n\nIn  sum,  it  should  be  emphasized  that  judicial \nabstention on international comity grounds should be \nexceedingly  rare.    For  instance,  if the  United  States, \nnot  private  litigants,  had  brought  the  Sherman  Act \nchallenge  in  this  case,  a  federal  court  should  never \nabstain.    The  government’s  decision  to  bring  an \nenforcement  action  “represents  a  determination  that \nthe  importance  of  antitrust  enforcement  outweighs \nany  relevant  foreign  policy  concerns.”  U.S.  Dep’t  of \nJustice  &  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n,  Antitrust  Guidelines \nfor International Enforcement and Cooperation § 4.1, \nat 28 (2017).  \n\n \n \n \n\f13 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor the reasons set forth above, this Court should \nnot address the question it left open in Hartford Fire \n“whether a court with Sherman Act jurisdiction should \never decline to exercise such jurisdiction on grounds of \ninternational comity.”  509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993).  If it \ndoes  reach  that  question,  it  might  use  this  case  as a \nvehicle  for  announcing  principles  of  international \ncomity  abstention  that  U.S.  courts  could  invoke  in \nsensitive foreign relations cases. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nSAMUEL ESTREICHER \n   Counsel of Record \nNEW YORK UNIVERSITY  \n   SCHOOL OF LAW \n40 Washington Square South  \nNew York, New York 10012 \n(212) 998-6226 \nsamuel.estreicher@nyu.edu \n\nTHOMAS H.
