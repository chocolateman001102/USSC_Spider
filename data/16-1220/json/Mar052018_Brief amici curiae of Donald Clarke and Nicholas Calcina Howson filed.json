He is a member of the Executive Editorial \nBoard  of  the  American  Journal  of  Comparative \nLaw  and  of  the  Editorial  Boards  of  the  China \nQuarterly  and  the  Journal  of  Comparative  Law. \nHe  has  served  as  an  expert  witness  in  Chinese \nlaw  matters \nand \nadministrative agencies as well as in state courts \nand \nlitigation  and  arbitration \nproceedings.

He  has \nserved as a consultant on Chinese law matters for \na  number  of  U.S.  and  international  institutions \nand  served  as  an  expert  witness  on  Chinese  law \nmatters  in  U.S.  federal  court  litigation,  U.S. \nagency  enforcement  proceedings,  international \nand  Chinese  arbitrations,  and  in  litigation  before \nthe  Beijing  Higher  People's  Court.  He  has  just \nconcluded  service  as the  only  non-Chinese  citizen \nmember  of  the  Asian  Development  Bank-funded \nexpert  group  advising  the  Chinese  legislature  on \nwholesale amendment of the 2006 Securities Law \nof  China.  Professor  Howson  is  also  a  member  of \nthe Council on Foreign Relations.  \n\nAmici have academic expertise and a strong \ninterest  in  the  proper  interaction  of  the  United \nStates legal system with the Chinese legal system. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  has  held  that  “when  a \nforeign  government,  acting  through  counsel  or \notherwise,  directly  participates  in  U.S.  court \nproceedings  by  providing  a  sworn  evidentiary \nproffer regarding the construction and effect of its \nlaws  and  regulations,  which  is  reasonable  under \nthe  circumstances  presented,  a  U.S.  court  is \nbound to defer to those statements.” In re Vitamin \nC  Antitrust  Litig.,  837  F.3d  175,  189  (2d  Cir. \n2016). This rule of conclusive deference should be \nrejected  because  it  requires  courts  to  ignore",
        "3 \n\nreality  and  to  sacrifice  the  search  for  truth  and \naccuracy in adjudication to other, lesser values.  \n\nThat  a  foreign  legal  system  is  complex \nstrengthens  rather  than  weakens  the  case  for  an \ninquiry into foreign law that takes into account a \nwide  range  of  sources  as  opposed  to  a  single \nsource. \n\nto \nis \n\ndeference \n\nConclusive \n\nstatements \n\na \nforeign \nparticularly \ngovernment’s \ninappropriate when there is reason to believe that \nthe foreign government has an interest in the case \nakin  to  that  of  a  party.  In  this  case,  the  District \nCourt  found  facts  strongly  suggestive  of  the \npartiality  of  China’s  Ministry  of  Commerce  (the \n“Ministry”  or  “MOFCOM”),  the  entity  that \nsubmitted  the  statements  in  question.  Yet  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  would  foreclose  any  inquiry \nthat would uncover such facts. \n\nA  rule  of  conclusive  deference  also  renders \nirrelevant  the  critical  fact  that,  as  in  this  case,  a \nforeign  government  has  made  contradictory \nstatements  on  the  point  at  issue.  To  hold  that \ncourts  must  simply  accept  a  government’s  most \nrecent  statement,  or  the  statement  submitted  in \nthe  litigation  before  them,  is  an  impermissible \nabdication  of  the  responsibility  of  courts  to \ndetermine  the  content  of \nlaw  with \naccuracy. \n\nforeign \n\nproblem \nthe \n\nis \ncontradiction \nThe \ncompounded  by \nthat  MOFCOM’s \nassertion  that  it  has  “unquestioned  authority  to \ninterpret  applicable  Chinese  law”  is  a  mere  ipse \ndixit accompanied by no authority or argument. In \n\nof \nfact",
        "4 \n\nfact,  MOFCOM  is  a  mere  ministry  within  the \nChinese  central  government  and, \nlike  other \nministries,  may  not  make  rules  that  contravene \nhigher-level  norms,  such  as  statutes.  Not  only \ndoes  MOFCOM  have  no  authority  to  interpret \nstatutes,  but  Chinese  law  is  clear  that  ministries \nmay  not  be  the  final  arbiters  of  the  validity  of \ntheir  own  rules  within  the  Chinese  legal  system. \nAsserting  that  its  authority  to  interpret  law  is \nunquestioned does not make it so. \n\nThis  case  involves  the  interaction  of  two \nlegal  systems.  The  key  question  in  this  case  is \nwhether a “true conflict” existed between the laws \nof  China  and  the  United  States  such  that \n“compliance  with  the  laws  of  both  countries \n[was]  .  .  .  impossible[.]”  Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v. \nCalifornia,  509  U.S.  764,  797–99  (1993).  To  be \nsure,  a  court  should  attempt  to  “reconcile[]  the \ncentral  concerns  of  both  sets  of  laws.”  Société \nNationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale  v.  U.S.  Dist. \nCourt  for  S.  Dist.  of  Iowa,  482  U.S.  522,  555 \n(1987).  But  it  must  in  the  end  do  so  itself,  and \ncannot  uncritically  delegate  any  part  of  this  task \nto a foreign government. \n\nFinally, conclusive deference is not required \nby considerations of deference to the foreign policy \npowers  of  the  executive  branch.  The  executive \nbranch has already made its position clear in this \ncase:  it  desires  courts  to  make  determinations  of \nforeign law without granting conclusive deference \nto the expressed views of foreign governments.

The Complexity of a Foreign Legal System \nStrengthens Rather than Weakens the Case \nAgainst Conclusive Deference \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 (“Rule \n44.1”) states that the determination of foreign law \nis  a  question  of  law  for  the  court  and  not  a \nquestion  of  fact  for  the  jury.

Nov. 23, 2009), ECF No. 394-2. \n\nBut  this  strengthens  rather  than  weakens \nthe  case  for  a  realistic  inquiry  by  the  trial  court \ninstead  of  unthinking  deference  to  an  official \nstatement.  Far  from  assuming  that  the  Chinese \nlegal  system  was  similar  to  that  of  the  United \nStates, the District Court took explicit notice of its \ndifference: \n\nthis  country—that \n\nin \nseries  of \n\nAt  the  outset,  I  am  compelled  to  note  that \nthe Chinese law and regulatory regime that \ndefendants  rely  on  is  something  of  a \ndeparture  from  the  concept  of  “law”  as  we \nis,  a \nit \nknow \npublished \nconduct-\ndictating  prohibitions  or  compulsions  with \nan  identified  sanctions  system.

In \naddition,  defendants’  own  expert  asserts \nimportant \nthat  oral  directives  are  an \ncomponent  of  Chinese  regulatory  law  and \nadmits  that  “Chinese  governmental  control \nis a quite different process from what takes \nplace in other countries.” Of course, foreign \nlegal  regimes  that  are  markedly  different \nfrom our own can still, in their own unique \nconduct. \nways, \nHowever,  in  some  circumstances,  asserting \na  claim  of  compulsion  under  a  foreign \nregime that so differs from our own concept \nof  law  can  be  akin  to  trying  to  fit  a  round \npeg into a square hole. \n\ncompel  a  defendant’s \n\nIn  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,  810  F.  Supp.  2d \n522, 550 (E.D.N.Y. 2011). \n\nIn  such circumstances,  it  is entirely  proper \nfor  a  court  to  consider  the  views  of  a  foreign \ngovernment,  which  may  offer  valuable  insights \ninto  the  reality  of  a  regulatory  regime  that \ndiverges from its apparent form on paper. But it is \nequally  proper  for  a  court  to  take  evidence  from \nother  parties  as  to  what  that  reality  was, \nespecially  when  the  government  in  question  has \ndemonstrated  an  intense  interest  in  the  outcome \nof  the  litigation,  see  infra  Part  II,  and  has  made \ncontradictory  statements  in  the  past,  see  infra \nPart III.",

This  raises  the \npossibility that the government’s  characterization \nof  its  own  law  could  be  opportunistic  and  not \nneutral,  and  hence  calls for  further  investigation, \nnot blind deference. \n\nThe  Chinese  government  is  not  a  neutral \nobserver  of  this  case.

The \namicus briefs may be submitted in order to \nshield  the  foreign  defendants  from  liability \nin  the  U.S.,  even  if  their  conduct  was \nanticompetitive. \npragmatic \nFrom \nin  a \nperspective, \ntransnational  context  represent  a  transfer \nof  wealth \nforeign \nshould  be \njurisdiction  and \navoided. \n\nfines  or  damages \n\nfrom  home \n\ntherefore \n\nto  a \n\na \n\nMarek  Martyniszyn,  Foreign  States’  Amicus \nCuriae  Participation  in  U.S.  Antitrust  Cases,  61 \nAntitrust Bull. 611, 630 (2016). \n\nThe partiality of the Ministry in this case is \nset  forth  extensively  by  the  District  Court  in  its \nMemorandum Decision and Order of Oct. 1, 2012, \nin which it found that “[t]he circumstances of this \nlitigation  provide  ample  .  .  .  reasons  to  conclude \nrespecting \nthat \n\n[the  Ministry’s \n\nstatements",
        "11 \n\nChinese law] are not trustworthy” and “there is no \ndispute  that  the  Ministry  is  not  impartial  in  this \nlitigation.”  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,  Nos. \n06-MD-1738 (BMC) (JO), 2012 WL 4511308, at *3 \n(E.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2012). Indeed, the District Court \nfound  that  a  Ministry  statement  “does  not  read \nlike  a  frank  and  straightforward  explanation  of \nChinese  law”  but  instead  “reads  like  a  carefully \ncrafted  and  phrased  litigation  position.”  In  re \nVitamin C Antitrust Litig., 810 F. Supp. 2d at 552 \n(denying  motion  for  summary  judgment).  Courts \nshould  of  course  take  litigation  positions  into \naccount,  but  should  not  grant  them  conclusive \ndeference. \n\nIII. MOFCOM's Attempt to Explain Away \nInconsistent Statements at WTO Fails \n\nThe  strongest  case  against  conclusive \ndeference arises when the foreign government, as \nin  this  case,  has  made  contradictory  statements \nabout  its  law  at  different  times  and  in  different \nfora.  A  rule  of  conclusive  deference  to  a  foreign \ngovernment’s representations does not resolve the \nquestion of which representation the court should \ndefer  to.  The  position  of  the  Ministry \nis \nessentially, “Never mind what we said before; you \nmust  accept  what  we  say  now.”  This  position  not \nonly  violates the  practical  spirit  of Rule  44.1,  but \nis  also  contrary  to  established  U.S.  law.  When  a \nforeign government makes conflicting statements, \na  court  is  not  bound  to  accept  its  most  recent \nstatement  or  the  one  offered  in  litigation.  See \nUnited  States.  v.  McNab,  331  F.3d  1228,  1242 \n(11th Cir. 2003).",
        "12 \n\nThat  MOFCOM  has  made  conflicting \nstatements  is  clear;  its  attempt  to  explain  away \nthe inconsistency fails. \n\nAs discussed in the District Court’s original \njudgment denying the defendants’ motion to grant \nsummary  judgment  in  their  favor,  MOFCOM, \nspeaking  through  China’s  Permanent  Mission  to \nthe  World  Trade  Organization  (the  “WTO”),  had \nstated in WTO proceedings that it did not exercise \nany  control  over  vitamin  C  export  pricing  or \nvolume.3 See In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 810 \nF.  Supp.  2d  at  532.  In  2002,  MOFCOM  formally \nrepresented  to  the  WTO  that  “[f]rom  1  January \n2002, China gave up  export administration of . . . \nvitamin  C[.]”  Council \nin  Goods, \nTransitional  Review  Under  Article  18  of  the \nProtocol  of  Accession  of  the  People’s  Republic  of \nChina, WTO Doc.

It  then  noted  that  there  were \n54  products  still  subject  to  export  administration \nand  that  a  list  of  such  products  and  the  relevant \nmeasures  had  been  provided  to  the  WTO.

In  none  of \nthe filings of MOFCOM or the Respondents has it \nbeen  contended  that  the  vitamin  C  industry  is  of \nstrategic  significance  to  the  Chinese  state  or  of \nparticular  importance  to  the  public  welfare  of \nChina. \n\nMOFCOM’s attempts to explain away these \nstatements  are  unconvincing.  In  its  August  31, \n2009  Statement  to  the  District  Court,  MOFCOM \ncorrectly  noted  that  “general  descriptions  of  the \ncurrent  status  of  China’s  market  economy  [cited \nby one of the plaintiffs’ experts] . . . should not be \ndeemed  as  explicit  or  implicit  statements  of \nChina’s  abandonment  of  its  limited  regulatory \npolicies  over \nindustries \nincluding  the  vitamin  C  industry[.]”  Defs.’  Decl. \nSupp.  Summ.

But this \nargument does nothing to explain away what is an \nexplicit  statement:  the  2002  claim  noted  above \nthat  China “gave  up  export  administration of .  . . \nvitamin C.” \n\nMOFCOM’s  subsequent  attempt  to  do \nbetter  in  its  amicus  brief  to  the  Second  Circuit \nfails  as  well.  In  that  brief,  it  called  attention  to \nthe  fact  that  the  2002  statement  about  giving  up \nexport  administration  came  in  a  section  headed, \n“Restrictions  on  exports  through  non-automatic \nlicensing,” and asserted that this therefore means \nthat  China  was  not  declaring  it  had  given  up  all \nforms  of  export  restrictions  over  vitamin  C.  See \nBrief for  Amicus  Curiae  Ministry  of  Commerce  of \nChina in Support of Defendants-Appellants at 27, \nIn re  Vitamin  C Antitrust Litig., No. 13-4791, (2d \nCir.  Apr.  14,  2014),  ECF  No.  105.  This  argument \nis,  as  will  be  shown  below,  frail  to  the  point  of \nbeing disingenuous. \n\nFirst,  and  most  incredibly,  MOFCOM’s \namicus  brief  omitted  three  important  words  that \nfollow  the  quoted  language  in  the  heading:  “or \nother means.” Thus, the statement that China had \ngiven  up  export  administration  of  vitamin  C \nappeared in a section entitled, “Any restrictions on \nexports  through  non-automatic  licensing  or  other \nmeans justified by specific product under the WTO \nAgreement or the Protocol.”4 Council for Trade in \n\n4  The  Protocol  refers  to  China’s  Protocol  of  Accession,  i.e., \nthe specific agreement under which China joined the WTO. \nThe  language  “justified  by  specific  product  .  .  .”  refers  to \nChina’s  obligation  to  provide  a  product-specific  justification",
        "15 \n\nGoods,  Transitional  Review  Under  Article  18  of \nthe Protocol of Accession of the People’s Republic of \nChina, WTO Doc. G/C/W/438, at 2 (Nov. 20, 2002) \n(emphasis  added).  China’s  statement  about \nvitamin  C  was  an  affirmative  declaration  that  it \nhad  no  measures  that  would  count  as  “any \nrestrictions  .  .  .  through  non-automatic  licensing \nor other means.” \n\nSecond,  MOFCOM’s  argument  fails  even \nwithout the “or other means” language. Automatic \nlicensing  refers  to  licenses  designed  to  monitor \nexports,  not  regulate  them;  in  non-automatic \nlicensing  systems,  by  contrast,  certain  conditions \nmust  be  met  before  a  license  is  issued.5  Non-\nautomatic licensing is precisely the kind of regime \nthat MOFCOM now claims existed over vitamin C \nexports:  manufacturers  would  be  allowed  to \nexport  only  if  their  sales  contracts  had  been \napproved  under  the  “verification  and  chop” \nsystem.  See  Brief  for  Amicus  Curiae  Ministry  of \nCommerce  of  China  in  Support  of  Defendants-\nAppellants  at  5,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig., \nNo. 13-4791 (2d Cir.

Although \nthis  case  is  about  export  licenses,  the  distinction  between \nautomatic  and  non-automatic,  and  their  meaning,  is  the \nsame.",
        "16 \n\na \n\nFinally, \n\nin \nfurther \nMOFCOM’s position is worth noting. In Section 8 \nof  China’s  Protocol  of  Accession  to  the  WTO,  the \nChinese  government  agreed  to  publish  in  an \nofficial journal \n\ninconsistency \n\nby  product,  the  list  of  all  organizations, \nincluding \nthose  organizations  delegated \nsuch  authority  by  the  national  authorities, \nthat  are  responsible  for  authorizing  or \napproving \nimports  or  exports,  whether \nthrough  grant  of  licence  or  other  approval; \n[and]  procedures  and  criteria  for  obtaining \nsuch  import  or  export  licences  or  other \napprovals,  and  the  conditions  for  deciding \nwhether they should be granted[.] \n\nProtocol  on  the  Accession  of  the  People’s  Republic \nof China, § 8(1)(a), WTO Doc. WT/L/432 (Nov. 23, \n2001) (emphasis added). \n\nHad  such  a  notice  ever  been  published,  it \nwould have been in the interest of MOFCOM and \nthe  Respondents  to  mention  it  at  some  point  in \nthese  proceedings.  That  they  have  not  done  so \nstrongly  suggests  that  China \nin  fact  never \npublished any notification stating that MOFCOM \nor  any  trade  association  acting  by  delegated \nauthority6  exercised  any  control  over  exports  of \nvitamin C. \n\n6  According  to  MOFCOM’s  statements  in  this  case,  that \nwould be the Chamber of Commerce of Medicine and Health \nProducts  Importers  &  Exporters.  See  Brief  for  Amicus \nCuriae  Ministry  of  Commerce  of  China  in  Support  of \nDefendants-Appellants at 4, In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig.,",
        "17 \n\nThe  unfortunate  conclusion  is  inescapable: \nMOFCOM’s representations (both affirmative and \nnegative) to the WTO on the one hand and to the \ncourts  of  the  United  States  in  this  case  on  the \nother \nsuch \ncircumstances,  the  courts  have  no  choice  but  to \nundertake their own inquiry as best they can. \n\ncannot  both  be  accurate. \n\nIn \n\nIV. MOFCOM Does Not Have “Unquestioned \nAuthority” to Interpret Applicable Chinese \nLaw \n\nIn  its  amicus  brief  to  the  Second  Circuit, \nMOFCOM  declared  that  it  had  “unquestioned \nauthority  to  interpret  applicable  Chinese  law.” \nBrief for  Amicus  Curiae  Ministry  of Commerce  of \nChina in Support of Defendants-Appellants at 14, \nIn  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,  No.  13-4791  (2d \nCir. Apr. 14, 2014), ECF No. 105.   Yet it cited no \nthis  claim.  From \nauthority \nMOFCOM’s standpoint, this is  understandable: it \nis making an assertion about Chinese law, and to \nprovide  reasons  and  authorities  for  its  assertions \nabout  Chinese  law  is  precisely  what  MOFCOM \nargues  strenuously  it  must  not  be  required  to  do. \nThe  difficulty  this  poses  for  the  Second  Circuit’s \nrule  of  conclusive  deference,  however,  is  obvious: \nif conclusive deference is granted to a government \n\nin  support  of \n\nNo. 13-4791 (2d Cir. Apr. 14,  2014), ECF No. 105;   Brief of \nAmicus  Curiae  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  of  China  in \nSupport of the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Complaint \nat  7–8,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,    No.  06-mdl-1738 \n(DGT) (E.D.N.Y.

        "18 \n\nbody’s  assertion  of  its  own  authority,  then  any \ngovernment  body  at  any  level  can  bootstrap  its \nauthority  merely  by  claiming  that  such  authority \nexists.  Modern governments  are  complex entities, \nwith  different  branches,  levels,  and  departments \noften  functionally  independent  of  each  other.  The \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  opens  the  door  to  a \ncacophony  of  different  interpretations,  each  of \nwhich must be treated as accurate with conclusive \nand unquestioning deference. A rule that deprives \ncourts  of  the  ability  to  examine  a  claim  of \nauthority  cannot  advance  the  interests  of  comity \nor justice. \n\nFurthermore,  MOFCOM’s  sweeping  claim \nto “unquestioned authority to interpret applicable \nChinese law” is simply inaccurate. \n\nto \n\nThe  authority \n\ninterpret  Chinese \nstatutory law (falü) is granted by China’s Law on \nLegislation  to  the  National  People’s  Congress  or \nits Standing Committee.

        "19 \n\nthe \n\ncontent  and \n\nThis  case  does  not,  however, \n\ninvolve \nstatutory  law;  it  involves  instead  MOFCOM’s \nimport  of \nclaims  about \nMOFCOM’s own ministry-level rules. The Chinese \nterm  for  such  rules,  bumen  guizhang,  is  often \ntranslated  as  “departmental  rules.”  According  to \nthe  Law  on  Legislation,  departmental  rules  shall \nbe  for  the  implementation  of  matters  covered  by \nstatutory  law  or  various  regulatory  documents \n(the  terms  in  question  can  be  translated  as \nadministrative  regulations \nfagui), \ndecisions  (jueding),  and  orders  (mingling))  issued \nby  China’s  State  Council,  a  body  superior  to \nMOFCOM.  See  id.,  art.  80.  Where  they  do  not \nserve the purpose of implementing such statutory \nlaw  or  State  Council  documents,  departmental \nrules  may  not  impair  the  rights  or  increase  the \nduties  of \nlegal  entities  such  as \ncorporations, or other organizations.

See  id.,  art. \n36.  Article  37  prohibits  government  administrative \nauthorities  from  abusing  their  authority  by  making  rules \nthat  eliminate  or  restrict  competition.  See  id.,  art.  37. \nChina’s  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  a \nministry-level body independent of MOFCOM, is responsible \nfor enforcing the rules of the Antimonopoly Law relating to \nprice  cartels.

Yet  MOFCOM  has  no \npower  to  require  Customs,  also  of  full  ministry \nrank  in  China’s  administrative  structure,8  to \nfollow  its  orders.  See  Susan  V.  Lawrence  & \nMichael F.

Just  as  MOFCOM  cannot  require \nthe  National  Development \nand  Reform \nCommission  to  overlook  a  MOFCOM-sponsored \nprice  cartel  (should  the  former  wish  to  break  it \nup),9  so  it  cannot  force  Customs  to  deny  export \npermission to disfavored companies. In each case, \nthe matter will be settled by bargaining, not law. \nSee  Kenneth  Lieberthal,  Governing  China  189-92 \n(2d ed. 2004). \n\n8  Customs  is  formally  a  “general  administration”  and  as \nsuch  has  the  same  rank  as  a  ministry  such  as  MOFCOM. \nSee  Susan  V.

        "22 \n\nNone  of  this  is  to  deny  that  it  would  be  a \ndaunting task for an American court to determine \nif  MOFCOM’s  rules  would  for  some  reason  be \ndeemed invalid under Chinese law by a competent \nChinese authority, and this brief does not purport \nto make such a determination in this case. What it \nargues instead is simply that it is entirely possible \nfor  MOFCOM’s  rules  to  be  invalid  within  the \nChinese  legal  system,  just  as  it  is  possible  for  a \nU.S.  government  department  or  administrative \nagency’s rules to be found invalid within the U.S. \nlegal  system.  MOFCOM  does  not  have  the \nauthority  within  the  Chinese  legal  system  to \ndecide  on  the  validity  of  its  own  measures;  still \nless  does  it  have  “unquestioned  authority  to \ninterpret applicable Chinese law.”  \n\nWhile  it  is  not  surprising  that  MOFCOM’s \namicus  briefs  and  other  submissions  in  this  case \nexpress no doubt as to the validity of MOFCOM’s \nactions  within  the  Chinese  legal  system,  the  fact \nis that they make a difficult and complex problem \nappear \nstraightforward.

        "24 \n\nCommerce—as it assuredly is the job of American \ncourts—to promote those values and policies. \n\nthe  body \n\nthat  has  been  given \n\nTo  be  sure,  American  courts  by  the  same \ntoken  do  not  have  expertise  on  foreign  law.  But \nsomebody  must  decide  these  questions,  and  they \nthe \nare \nconstitutional  and  statutory  authority  to  do  so. \nThey  can  decide  whether  a  true  conflict  exists \nwith foreign law in the same way that they decide \nother  questions  on  which  they  lack  expertise:  by \ntaking  testimony  and  examining  evidence.  That \nprocess  should  certainly  include  listening  to  the \nviews  of  the  relevant  foreign  government,  but  it \nshould not exclude all other kinds of evidence that \nmight  be  relevant  (including,  as  in  this  case, \nevidence  that  the  foreign  government  in  question \nmade contradictory statements in the past). \n\nVI. Conclusive Deference Is Unreasonable \nand Not Required by Considerations of \nDeference to the Foreign Policy Powers of \nthe Executive Branch \n\nThe  position  of  MOFCOM  is  clear:  not  just \nsubstantial deference, but conclusive obedience to \nits  wishes is  what  American  courts  must  display: \n“When a foreign sovereign appears in such a case \nto say what it demanded of a defendant, it should \nnot  be  open  to  a  district  court  to  deny  the \ncommand  was  given.”  Brief  for  Amicus  Curiae \nMinistry  of  Commerce  of  China  in  Support  of \nDefendants-Appellants  at  13,  In  re  Vitamin  C \nAntitrust  Litig.,  No.  13-4791  (2d  Cir.  Apr.  14, \n2014),  ECF  No.  105.  This  duty  of  obedience  is  so",
        "25 \n\nstrong,  in  MOFCOM’s  view,  that  it  forbids  any \ninquiry into whether the representation is, in fact, \ncorrect. More important than the search for truth \nis  the  duty  not  to  be  “disrespectful”  and  not  to \nincur \nthe  Chinese \n“displeasure” \ngovernment. See id. at 2, 13. \n\nthe \n\nof \n\nfor \n\nfamiliar, \n\nexample,  with \n\nThis  is  asking  too  much.  It  is  the  duty  of \nAmerican  courts  to  dispense  justice  according  to \nlaw  as  best  they  can,  not  to  cater  to  the  amour-\npropre  of  foreign  governments,  much  less  to \npretend  that  foreign  governments  will  never \nattempt  to  use  the  American \nlegal  system \nstrategically—and  to  refuse  even  to  consider \nevidence  to  the  contrary.  American  courts  are \nalready \nthe \nphenomenon  of  “blocking  statutes,”  whereby  a \nforeign  government  attempts  to  protect \nits \nnationals  by  deliberately  erecting  a  conflicting \nduty.  See  Restatement \n(Third)  of  Foreign \nRelations  Law  §  442  reporters’  note  4  (1987) \n(“Blocking \ntake \nstatutes  are  designed \nadvantage  of  the  foreign  government  compulsion \ndefense . . . by prohibiting the disclosure, copying, \ninspection, or removal of documents located in the \nterritory  of the  enacting  state  in  compliance  with \norders of foreign authorities.”). Accordingly, courts \ngrant  them  a  lower  degree  of  deference.  See \nSociété  Nationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale,  482 \nU.S. at 544 n.29. \n\nto \n\nAmerican \n\ncourts  should  be  similarly \nrealistic  in  their  approach  to  the  declarations  of \nforeign  governments  on  other  matters,  including \ncharacterizations  of  foreign  law.

        "26 \n\nthe  authority  of  the  executive  branch  to  conduct \nforeign  relations—is  not  present  in  this  case, \ngiven  that  the  executive  branch,  in  the  person  of \nthe  Solicitor  General,  has  announced \nits \nopposition  to  the  Second  Circuit’s  standard  of \nconclusive  deference.

Professor  Howson  is  also  a  member  of \nthe Council on Foreign Relations.  \n\nAmici have academic expertise and a strong \ninterest  in  the  proper  interaction  of  the  United \nStates legal system with the Chinese legal system. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  has  held  that  “when  a \nforeign  government,  acting  through  counsel  or \notherwise,  directly  participates  in  U.S.  court \nproceedings  by  providing  a  sworn  evidentiary \nproffer regarding the construction and effect of its \nlaws  and  regulations,  which  is  reasonable  under \nthe  circumstances  presented,  a  U.S.  court  is \nbound to defer to those statements.” In re Vitamin \nC  Antitrust  Litig.,  837  F.3d  175,  189  (2d  Cir. \n2016). This rule of conclusive deference should be \nrejected  because  it  requires  courts  to  ignore \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\nreality  and  to  sacrifice  the  search  for  truth  and \naccuracy in adjudication to other, lesser values.  \n\nThat  a  foreign  legal  system  is  complex \nstrengthens  rather  than  weakens  the  case  for  an \ninquiry into foreign law that takes into account a \nwide  range  of  sources  as  opposed  to  a  single \nsource. \n\nto \nis \n\ndeference \n\nConclusive \n\nstatements \n\na \nforeign \nparticularly \ngovernment’s \ninappropriate when there is reason to believe that \nthe foreign government has an interest in the case \nakin  to  that  of  a  party.  In  this  case,  the  District \nCourt  found  facts  strongly  suggestive  of  the \npartiality  of  China’s  Ministry  of  Commerce  (the \n“Ministry”  or  “MOFCOM”),  the  entity  that \nsubmitted  the  statements  in  question.  Yet  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  would  foreclose  any  inquiry \nthat would uncover such facts. \n\nA  rule  of  conclusive  deference  also  renders \nirrelevant  the  critical  fact  that,  as  in  this  case,  a \nforeign  government  has  made  contradictory \nstatements  on  the  point  at  issue.  To  hold  that \ncourts  must  simply  accept  a  government’s  most \nrecent  statement,  or  the  statement  submitted  in \nthe  litigation  before  them,  is  an  impermissible \nabdication  of  the  responsibility  of  courts  to \ndetermine  the  content  of \nlaw  with \naccuracy. \n\nforeign \n\nproblem \nthe \n\nis \ncontradiction \nThe \ncompounded  by \nthat  MOFCOM’s \nassertion  that  it  has  “unquestioned  authority  to \ninterpret  applicable  Chinese  law”  is  a  mere  ipse \ndixit accompanied by no authority or argument. In \n\nof \nfact \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 \n\nfact,  MOFCOM  is  a  mere  ministry  within  the \nChinese  central  government  and, \nlike  other \nministries,  may  not  make  rules  that  contravene \nhigher-level  norms,  such  as  statutes.  Not  only \ndoes  MOFCOM  have  no  authority  to  interpret \nstatutes,  but  Chinese  law  is  clear  that  ministries \nmay  not  be  the  final  arbiters  of  the  validity  of \ntheir  own  rules  within  the  Chinese  legal  system. \nAsserting  that  its  authority  to  interpret  law  is \nunquestioned does not make it so. \n\nThis  case  involves  the  interaction  of  two \nlegal  systems.  The  key  question  in  this  case  is \nwhether a “true conflict” existed between the laws \nof  China  and  the  United  States  such  that \n“compliance  with  the  laws  of  both  countries \n[was]  .  .  .  impossible[.]”  Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v. \nCalifornia,  509  U.S.  764,  797–99  (1993).  To  be \nsure,  a  court  should  attempt  to  “reconcile[]  the \ncentral  concerns  of  both  sets  of  laws.”  Société \nNationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale  v.  U.S.  Dist. \nCourt  for  S.  Dist.  of  Iowa,  482  U.S.  522,  555 \n(1987).  But  it  must  in  the  end  do  so  itself,  and \ncannot  uncritically  delegate  any  part  of  this  task \nto a foreign government. \n\nFinally, conclusive deference is not required \nby considerations of deference to the foreign policy \npowers  of  the  executive  branch.  The  executive \nbranch has already made its position clear in this \ncase:  it  desires  courts  to  make  determinations  of \nforeign law without granting conclusive deference \nto the expressed views of foreign governments.

Far  from  assuming  that  the  Chinese \nlegal  system  was  similar  to  that  of  the  United \nStates, the District Court took explicit notice of its \ndifference: \n\nthis  country—that \n\nin \nseries  of \n\nAt  the  outset,  I  am  compelled  to  note  that \nthe Chinese law and regulatory regime that \ndefendants  rely  on  is  something  of  a \ndeparture  from  the  concept  of  “law”  as  we \nis,  a \nit \nknow \npublished \nconduct-\ndictating  prohibitions  or  compulsions  with \nan  identified  sanctions  system.

This  raises  the \npossibility that the government’s  characterization \nof  its  own  law  could  be  opportunistic  and  not \nneutral,  and  hence  calls for  further  investigation, \nnot blind deference. \n\nThe  Chinese  government  is  not  a  neutral \nobserver  of  this  case.

To say that a \ngovernment  may  side  with  its  nationals  is  not \ninsulting  to  that  government;  it  is  simply  the \ncommon-sense  acknowledgement  of  a  well-known \nreality.  As  noted  in  a  recent  study  of  foreign \nstates’ amicus curiae submissions, \n\nin \n\nbe, \n\nforeign  nations’  amicus \n\nsome \ncuriae \nessence, \nsubmissions  may \nmercantilist.

Oct. 1, 2012). Indeed, the District Court \nfound  that  a  Ministry  statement  “does  not  read \nlike  a  frank  and  straightforward  explanation  of \nChinese  law”  but  instead  “reads  like  a  carefully \ncrafted  and  phrased  litigation  position.”  In  re \nVitamin C Antitrust Litig., 810 F. Supp. 2d at 552 \n(denying  motion  for  summary  judgment).  Courts \nshould  of  course  take  litigation  positions  into \naccount,  but  should  not  grant  them  conclusive \ndeference. \n\nIII. MOFCOM's Attempt to Explain Away \nInconsistent Statements at WTO Fails \n\nThe  strongest  case  against  conclusive \ndeference arises when the foreign government, as \nin  this  case,  has  made  contradictory  statements \nabout  its  law  at  different  times  and  in  different \nfora.  A  rule  of  conclusive  deference  to  a  foreign \ngovernment’s representations does not resolve the \nquestion of which representation the court should \ndefer  to.  The  position  of  the  Ministry \nis \nessentially, “Never mind what we said before; you \nmust  accept  what  we  say  now.”  This  position  not \nonly  violates the  practical  spirit  of Rule  44.1,  but \nis  also  contrary  to  established  U.S.  law.  When  a \nforeign government makes conflicting statements, \na  court  is  not  bound  to  accept  its  most  recent \nstatement  or  the  one  offered  in  litigation.  See \nUnited  States.  v.  McNab,  331  F.3d  1228,  1242 \n(11th Cir. 2003). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 \n\nThat  MOFCOM  has  made  conflicting \nstatements  is  clear;  its  attempt  to  explain  away \nthe inconsistency fails. \n\nAs discussed in the District Court’s original \njudgment denying the defendants’ motion to grant \nsummary  judgment  in  their  favor,  MOFCOM, \nspeaking  through  China’s  Permanent  Mission  to \nthe  World  Trade  Organization  (the  “WTO”),  had \nstated in WTO proceedings that it did not exercise \nany  control  over  vitamin  C  export  pricing  or \nvolume.3 See In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., 810 \nF.  Supp.  2d  at  532.  In  2002,  MOFCOM  formally \nrepresented  to  the  WTO  that  “[f]rom  1  January \n2002, China gave up  export administration of . . . \nvitamin  C[.]”  Council \nin  Goods, \nTransitional  Review  Under  Article  18  of  the \nProtocol  of  Accession  of  the  People’s  Republic  of \nChina, WTO Doc.

It  then  noted  that  there  were \n54  products  still  subject  to  export  administration \nand  that  a  list  of  such  products  and  the  relevant \nmeasures  had  been  provided  to  the  WTO.

According \nto  the  submission,  the  exceptions  were  in “a  very \nlimited  number  of  products  and  services,  which \nare either of strategic significance or of particular \nimportance  to  the  public  welfare.”  Id.  In  none  of \nthe filings of MOFCOM or the Respondents has it \nbeen  contended  that  the  vitamin  C  industry  is  of \nstrategic  significance  to  the  Chinese  state  or  of \nparticular  importance  to  the  public  welfare  of \nChina. \n\nMOFCOM’s attempts to explain away these \nstatements  are  unconvincing.  In  its  August  31, \n2009  Statement  to  the  District  Court,  MOFCOM \ncorrectly  noted  that  “general  descriptions  of  the \ncurrent  status  of  China’s  market  economy  [cited \nby one of the plaintiffs’ experts] . . . should not be \ndeemed  as  explicit  or  implicit  statements  of \nChina’s  abandonment  of  its  limited  regulatory \npolicies  over \nindustries \nincluding  the  vitamin  C  industry[.]”  Defs.’  Decl. \nSupp.  Summ.

But this \nargument does nothing to explain away what is an \nexplicit  statement:  the  2002  claim  noted  above \nthat  China “gave  up  export  administration of .  . . \nvitamin C.” \n\nMOFCOM’s  subsequent  attempt  to  do \nbetter  in  its  amicus  brief  to  the  Second  Circuit \nfails  as  well.  In  that  brief,  it  called  attention  to \nthe  fact  that  the  2002  statement  about  giving  up \nexport  administration  came  in  a  section  headed, \n“Restrictions  on  exports  through  non-automatic \nlicensing,” and asserted that this therefore means \nthat  China  was  not  declaring  it  had  given  up  all \nforms  of  export  restrictions  over  vitamin  C.  See \nBrief for  Amicus  Curiae  Ministry  of  Commerce  of \nChina in Support of Defendants-Appellants at 27, \nIn re  Vitamin  C Antitrust Litig., No. 13-4791, (2d \nCir.  Apr.  14,  2014),  ECF  No.  105.  This  argument \nis,  as  will  be  shown  below,  frail  to  the  point  of \nbeing disingenuous. \n\nFirst,  and  most  incredibly,  MOFCOM’s \namicus  brief  omitted  three  important  words  that \nfollow  the  quoted  language  in  the  heading:  “or \nother means.” Thus, the statement that China had \ngiven  up  export  administration  of  vitamin  C \nappeared in a section entitled, “Any restrictions on \nexports  through  non-automatic  licensing  or  other \nmeans justified by specific product under the WTO \nAgreement or the Protocol.”4 Council for Trade in \n\n4  The  Protocol  refers  to  China’s  Protocol  of  Accession,  i.e., \nthe specific agreement under which China joined the WTO. \nThe  language  “justified  by  specific  product  .  .  .”  refers  to \nChina’s  obligation  to  provide  a  product-specific  justification \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f15 \n\nGoods,  Transitional  Review  Under  Article  18  of \nthe Protocol of Accession of the People’s Republic of \nChina, WTO Doc. G/C/W/438, at 2 (Nov. 20, 2002) \n(emphasis  added).  China’s  statement  about \nvitamin  C  was  an  affirmative  declaration  that  it \nhad  no  measures  that  would  count  as  “any \nrestrictions  .  .  .  through  non-automatic  licensing \nor other means.” \n\nSecond,  MOFCOM’s  argument  fails  even \nwithout the “or other means” language. Automatic \nlicensing  refers  to  licenses  designed  to  monitor \nexports,  not  regulate  them;  in  non-automatic \nlicensing  systems,  by  contrast,  certain  conditions \nmust  be  met  before  a  license  is  issued.5  Non-\nautomatic licensing is precisely the kind of regime \nthat MOFCOM now claims existed over vitamin C \nexports:  manufacturers  would  be  allowed  to \nexport  only  if  their  sales  contracts  had  been \napproved  under  the  “verification  and  chop” \nsystem.  See  Brief  for  Amicus  Curiae  Ministry  of \nCommerce  of  China  in  Support  of  Defendants-\nAppellants  at  5,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig., \nNo. 13-4791 (2d Cir. Apr. 14, 2014), ECF No. 105. \n\nfor any such restrictions. \n\n5  The  distinction  in  the  case  of  import  licenses  is  explained \nat  the  website  of  the  Office  of  the  United  States  Trade \nRepresentative. See Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, \nImport  Licensing,  https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/wto-\nmultilateral-affairs/wto-issues/import-licensing.  Although \nthis  case  is  about  export  licenses,  the  distinction  between \nautomatic  and  non-automatic,  and  their  meaning,  is  the \nsame. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                               \n\f16 \n\na \n\nFinally, \n\nin \nfurther \nMOFCOM’s position is worth noting. In Section 8 \nof  China’s  Protocol  of  Accession  to  the  WTO,  the \nChinese  government  agreed  to  publish  in  an \nofficial journal \n\ninconsistency \n\nby  product,  the  list  of  all  organizations, \nincluding \nthose  organizations  delegated \nsuch  authority  by  the  national  authorities, \nthat  are  responsible  for  authorizing  or \napproving \nimports  or  exports,  whether \nthrough  grant  of  licence  or  other  approval; \n[and]  procedures  and  criteria  for  obtaining \nsuch  import  or  export  licences  or  other \napprovals,  and  the  conditions  for  deciding \nwhether they should be granted[.] \n\nProtocol  on  the  Accession  of  the  People’s  Republic \nof China, § 8(1)(a), WTO Doc. WT/L/432 (Nov. 23, \n2001) (emphasis added). \n\nHad  such  a  notice  ever  been  published,  it \nwould have been in the interest of MOFCOM and \nthe  Respondents  to  mention  it  at  some  point  in \nthese  proceedings.  That  they  have  not  done  so \nstrongly  suggests  that  China \nin  fact  never \npublished any notification stating that MOFCOM \nor  any  trade  association  acting  by  delegated \nauthority6  exercised  any  control  over  exports  of \nvitamin C. \n\n6  According  to  MOFCOM’s  statements  in  this  case,  that \nwould be the Chamber of Commerce of Medicine and Health \nProducts  Importers  &  Exporters.  See  Brief  for  Amicus \nCuriae  Ministry  of  Commerce  of  China  in  Support  of \nDefendants-Appellants at 4, In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n  \n \n                                                 \n\f17 \n\nThe  unfortunate  conclusion  is  inescapable: \nMOFCOM’s representations (both affirmative and \nnegative) to the WTO on the one hand and to the \ncourts  of  the  United  States  in  this  case  on  the \nother \nsuch \ncircumstances,  the  courts  have  no  choice  but  to \nundertake their own inquiry as best they can. \n\ncannot  both  be  accurate. \n\nIn \n\nIV. MOFCOM Does Not Have “Unquestioned \nAuthority” to Interpret Applicable Chinese \nLaw \n\nIn  its  amicus  brief  to  the  Second  Circuit, \nMOFCOM  declared  that  it  had  “unquestioned \nauthority  to  interpret  applicable  Chinese  law.” \nBrief for  Amicus  Curiae  Ministry  of Commerce  of \nChina in Support of Defendants-Appellants at 14, \nIn  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,  No.  13-4791  (2d \nCir. Apr. 14, 2014), ECF No. 105.   Yet it cited no \nthis  claim.  From \nauthority \nMOFCOM’s standpoint, this is  understandable: it \nis making an assertion about Chinese law, and to \nprovide  reasons  and  authorities  for  its  assertions \nabout  Chinese  law  is  precisely  what  MOFCOM \nargues  strenuously  it  must  not  be  required  to  do. \nThe  difficulty  this  poses  for  the  Second  Circuit’s \nrule  of  conclusive  deference,  however,  is  obvious: \nif conclusive deference is granted to a government \n\nin  support  of \n\nNo. 13-4791 (2d Cir. Apr. 14,  2014), ECF No. 105;   Brief of \nAmicus  Curiae  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  of  China  in \nSupport of the Defendants’ Motion to Dismiss the Complaint \nat  7–8,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,    No.  06-mdl-1738 \n(DGT) (E.D.N.Y.

Modern governments  are  complex entities, \nwith  different  branches,  levels,  and  departments \noften  functionally  independent  of  each  other.  The \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  opens  the  door  to  a \ncacophony  of  different  interpretations,  each  of \nwhich must be treated as accurate with conclusive \nand unquestioning deference. A rule that deprives \ncourts  of  the  ability  to  examine  a  claim  of \nauthority  cannot  advance  the  interests  of  comity \nor justice. \n\nFurthermore,  MOFCOM’s  sweeping  claim \nto “unquestioned authority to interpret applicable \nChinese law” is simply inaccurate. \n\nto \n\nThe  authority \n\ninterpret  Chinese \nstatutory law (falü) is granted by China’s Law on \nLegislation  to  the  National  People’s  Congress  or \nits Standing Committee.

See  id.,  art.  80.  Where  they  do  not \nserve the purpose of implementing such statutory \nlaw  or  State  Council  documents,  departmental \nrules  may  not  impair  the  rights  or  increase  the \nduties  of \nlegal  entities  such  as \ncorporations, or other organizations.  See id. In no \ncircumstances  may  departmental  regulations \ncontravene  superior  norms  such  as  statutory  law \nor  State  Council  administrative  regulations.

Its \nrules  might  be  infirm  or  invalid  for  a  number  of \nreasons:  they  might  impair  rights  or  increase \nduties  (as  a  mandatory  price  floor  surely  does) \nwhile  not  serving  the  purpose  of  implementing \n\nsuch  as \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 \n\nstatutory  law  or  State  Council  administrative \nregulations,  or  they  might  simply  contravene  the \nprovisions  of  superior  norms.

Nat’l  People’s  Cong., \nAug.  30,  2007,  effective  Aug.  1,  2008),  art.  13, \nhttp://www.npc.gov.cn/wxzl/gongbao/2007-\n10/09/content_5374672.htm [https://perma.cc/6MGH-KBVF]. \nArticle  36  of  the  AML  forbids  government  administrative \nauthorities—a term that includes MOFCOM—from abusing \ntheir  authority  by  compelling  producers  to  engage  in \nactivities  forbidden  by  the  Antimonopoly  Law.  See  id.,  art. \n36.  Article  37  prohibits  government  administrative \nauthorities  from  abusing  their  authority  by  making  rules \nthat  eliminate  or  restrict  competition.  See  id.,  art.  37. \nChina’s  National  Development  and  Reform  Commission,  a \nministry-level body independent of MOFCOM, is responsible \nfor enforcing the rules of the Antimonopoly Law relating to \nprice  cartels.  See  Wendy  Ng,  The  Independence  of  Chinese \nCompetition  Agencies  and  the  Impact  on  Competition \nEnforcement in China, 4 J. Antitrust Enforcement 188, 190 \n(2016).  In  the  past,  the  NDRC  has  brought  actions  against \ndomestic  price  cartels  organized  by  trade  associations,  see \nQian  Hao,  Overview  of  the  Administrative  Enforcement  of \nChina’s  Competition  Law, \nin \nCompetition  Law  in  the  EU  and  China  39,  50  (Caroline \nCauffman & Qian Hao eds., 2016) (“[M]ost of the major price \nmonopolies  handled  by  both  the  NDRC  and  its  local \ncounterparts  have  been  cartels  arranged  by \ntrade \nassociations.”), but the source does not state whether any of \nthe  cartels  purported  to  operate  under  the  compulsion  of \nanother Chinese government authority. \n\nin  Procedural  Rights \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f21 \n\nChinese  law  permit  MOFCOM  to  be  the  final \narbiter of the compliance of its own rules with the \nprinciples set forth in the Law on Legislation.  \n\nFinally,  it  is  worth  noting  that  the  system \nof  “verification  and  chop”  described  by  MOFCOM \nin its amicus  brief to  the  Second  Circuit  required \nthe cooperation of China’s General Administration \nof  Customs  (“Customs”).  Yet  MOFCOM  has  no \npower  to  require  Customs,  also  of  full  ministry \nrank  in  China’s  administrative  structure,8  to \nfollow  its  orders.  See  Susan  V.  Lawrence  & \nMichael F. Martin, Cong. Research Serv., R41007, \nUnderstanding China’s Political System 15 (2013), \nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41007.pdf  (“[E]ntities \nof equivalent  rank  cannot issue binding  orders to \neach  other.”).  Just  as  MOFCOM  cannot  require \nthe  National  Development \nand  Reform \nCommission  to  overlook  a  MOFCOM-sponsored \nprice  cartel  (should  the  former  wish  to  break  it \nup),9  so  it  cannot  force  Customs  to  deny  export \npermission to disfavored companies. In each case, \nthe matter will be settled by bargaining, not law. \nSee  Kenneth  Lieberthal,  Governing  China  189-92 \n(2d ed. 2004). \n\n8  Customs  is  formally  a  “general  administration”  and  as \nsuch  has  the  same  rank  as  a  ministry  such  as  MOFCOM. \nSee  Susan  V.  Lawrence  &  Michael  F.  Martin,  Cong. \nResearch  Serv.,  R41007,  Understanding China’s Political \nSystem \n(2013),  \nTable \nhttps://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R41007.pdf. \n9  The  authority  of  the  National  Development  and  Reform \nCommission  in  antimonopoly  enforcement  is  discussed  in \nfootnote 7, supra.  \n\n16, \n\n2 \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f22 \n\nNone  of  this  is  to  deny  that  it  would  be  a \ndaunting task for an American court to determine \nif  MOFCOM’s  rules  would  for  some  reason  be \ndeemed invalid under Chinese law by a competent \nChinese authority, and this brief does not purport \nto make such a determination in this case. What it \nargues instead is simply that it is entirely possible \nfor  MOFCOM’s  rules  to  be  invalid  within  the \nChinese  legal  system,  just  as  it  is  possible  for  a \nU.S.  government  department  or  administrative \nagency’s rules to be found invalid within the U.S. \nlegal  system.  MOFCOM  does  not  have  the \nauthority  within  the  Chinese  legal  system  to \ndecide  on  the  validity  of  its  own  measures;  still \nless  does  it  have  “unquestioned  authority  to \ninterpret applicable Chinese law.”  \n\nWhile  it  is  not  surprising  that  MOFCOM’s \namicus  briefs  and  other  submissions  in  this  case \nexpress no doubt as to the validity of MOFCOM’s \nactions  within  the  Chinese  legal  system,  the  fact \nis that they make a difficult and complex problem \nappear \nstraightforward.  Thus, \nconclusive  deference  to  MOFCOM’s  views  is \ninappropriate.  \n\nsimple  and \n\nV. Courts Should Not Delegate to Foreign \nGovernments the Power to Decide the \nMeaning of United States Legal Terms \n\nThe  key  question  in  this  case  is  whether  a \n“true  conflict”  existed  between  the  laws  of  China \nand the United States such that “compliance with \nthe  laws  of  both  countries  [was].  .  .  impossible[.]” \nHartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. 764, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f23 \n\n797–99  (1993).  The  concern  animating  the  “true \nconflict” question is one of comity: \n\nWhen  there  is  a  conflict,  a  court  should \nseek  a  reasonable  accommodation  that \nreconciles  the  central  concerns  of  both  sets \nof  laws.  In  doing  so,  it  should  perform  a \ntripartite  analysis \nthe \nforeign interests, the interests of the United \nStates,  and  the  mutual  interests  of  all \nnations \nfunctioning \ninternational legal regime. \n\nthat  considers \n\nsmoothly \n\nin \n\na \n\nSociété Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v. U.S. \nDist. Court for S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 555 \n(1987) (footnote omitted). \n\nWhat  must  be  reconciled  are  the  central \nconcerns  of  both  sets  of  laws:  those  of  the  United \nStates and those of the foreign state—in this case, \nChina. And whether there is indeed a true conflict \nin  the  sense  of  Aérospatiale  and  Hartford  Fire—\ndecisions  of  American  courts,  not  foreign  courts, \nusing  terms \nin \nAmerican  law—can  be  determined  only  by  an \nexamination  of  both  sets  of  laws  by  American \ncourts  with  a  view  to  effectuating  the  values  and \npolicies embodied in such terms. \n\nintended  to  be  meaningful \n\nThe \n\nCircuit \n\nSecond \n\nimpermissibly \ndelegated  this  task  to  MOFCOM,  allowing  it  to \ndetermine unilaterally and conclusively whether a \ntrue  conflict  existed,  even  though  the  Ministry  of \nCommerce  has  no  expertise  in  U.S.  antitrust  law \nor  the  values  and  policies  expressed  in  the  case \nlaw interpreting terms such as “true conflict,” and \neven though it is not the job of China’s Ministry of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f24 \n\nCommerce—as it assuredly is the job of American \ncourts—to promote those values and policies. \n\nthe  body \n\nthat  has  been  given \n\nTo  be  sure,  American  courts  by  the  same \ntoken  do  not  have  expertise  on  foreign  law.  But \nsomebody  must  decide  these  questions,  and  they \nthe \nare \nconstitutional  and  statutory  authority  to  do  so. \nThey  can  decide  whether  a  true  conflict  exists \nwith foreign law in the same way that they decide \nother  questions  on  which  they  lack  expertise:  by \ntaking  testimony  and  examining  evidence.  That \nprocess  should  certainly  include  listening  to  the \nviews  of  the  relevant  foreign  government,  but  it \nshould not exclude all other kinds of evidence that \nmight  be  relevant  (including,  as  in  this  case, \nevidence  that  the  foreign  government  in  question \nmade contradictory statements in the past). \n\nVI. Conclusive Deference Is Unreasonable \nand Not Required by Considerations of \nDeference to the Foreign Policy Powers of \nthe Executive Branch \n\nThe  position  of  MOFCOM  is  clear:  not  just \nsubstantial deference, but conclusive obedience to \nits  wishes is  what  American  courts  must  display: \n“When a foreign sovereign appears in such a case \nto say what it demanded of a defendant, it should \nnot  be  open  to  a  district  court  to  deny  the \ncommand  was  given.”  Brief  for  Amicus  Curiae \nMinistry  of  Commerce  of  China  in  Support  of \nDefendants-Appellants  at  13,  In  re  Vitamin  C \nAntitrust  Litig.,  No.  13-4791  (2d  Cir.  Apr.  14, \n2014),  ECF  No.  105.  This  duty  of  obedience  is  so \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f25 \n\nstrong,  in  MOFCOM’s  view,  that  it  forbids  any \ninquiry into whether the representation is, in fact, \ncorrect. More important than the search for truth \nis  the  duty  not  to  be  “disrespectful”  and  not  to \nincur \nthe  Chinese \n“displeasure” \ngovernment. See id. at 2, 13. \n\nthe \n\nof \n\nfor \n\nfamiliar, \n\nexample,  with \n\nThis  is  asking  too  much.  It  is  the  duty  of \nAmerican  courts  to  dispense  justice  according  to \nlaw  as  best  they  can,  not  to  cater  to  the  amour-\npropre  of  foreign  governments,  much  less  to \npretend  that  foreign  governments  will  never \nattempt  to  use  the  American \nlegal  system \nstrategically—and  to  refuse  even  to  consider \nevidence  to  the  contrary.  American  courts  are \nalready \nthe \nphenomenon  of  “blocking  statutes,”  whereby  a \nforeign  government  attempts  to  protect \nits \nnationals  by  deliberately  erecting  a  conflicting \nduty.  See  Restatement \n(Third)  of  Foreign \nRelations  Law  §  442  reporters’  note  4  (1987) \n(“Blocking \ntake \nstatutes  are  designed \nadvantage  of  the  foreign  government  compulsion \ndefense . . . by prohibiting the disclosure, copying, \ninspection, or removal of documents located in the \nterritory  of the  enacting  state  in  compliance  with \norders of foreign authorities.”). Accordingly, courts \ngrant  them  a  lower  degree  of  deference.  See \nSociété  Nationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale,  482 \nU.S. at 544 n.29. \n\nto \n\nAmerican \n\ncourts  should  be  similarly \nrealistic  in  their  approach  to  the  declarations  of \nforeign  governments  on  other  matters,  including \ncharacterizations  of  foreign  law.  The  traditional \nconcern  of  comity  analysis—infringement  upon \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f26 \n\nthe  authority  of  the  executive  branch  to  conduct \nforeign  relations—is  not  present  in  this  case, \ngiven  that  the  executive  branch,  in  the  person  of \nthe  Solicitor  General,  has  announced \nits \nopposition  to  the  Second  Circuit’s  standard  of \nconclusive  deference.  See  Brief  for  the  United \nStates  as  Amicus  Curiae,  Animal  Science \nProducts,  Inc.  v.  Hebei  Welcome  Pharm.  Co.,  86 \nU.S.L.W. 3351 (2018) (No. 16-1220).  \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe  rule  of  conclusive  deference  endorsed \nby  the  Second  Circuit  prevents  courts  from \nfulfilling  their  fundamental  mission—to  arrive  at \nan accurate  understanding  of foreign law—and  is \nnot  supported  by  considerations  of  deference  to \nforeign  affairs. \nthe \nAccordingly,  amici  respectfully  urges  that  the \njudgment below be reversed. \n\nexecutive  branch \n\nin \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nBRIAN P.
