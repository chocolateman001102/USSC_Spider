        "1 \n\nOPINIONS BELOW \n\nThe opinion of the United States Court of Appeals \nfor the Second Circuit (Pet. App. 1a) is reported at 837 \nF.3d  175.  The  opinion  of  the  United  States  District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York (Pet. App. \n39a)  denying  Respondents’  renewed  motion  for \njudgment  as  a  matter  of  law  is  unreported  but \navailable  at  2013  WL  6191945.  The  District  Court’s \nopinion  denying  Respondents’  motion  for  summary \njudgment (Pet. App. 54a) is reported at 810 F. Supp. 2d \n522. The District Court’s opinion denying Respondents’ \nmotion to dismiss (Pet. App. 157a) is reported at 584 F. \nSupp. 2d 546. \n\nJURISDICTION \n\nThe  Court  of  Appeals  entered  judgment  on \nSeptember  20,  2016,  and  denied  rehearing  on \nNovember  4,  2016.  On  January  3,  2017,  Justice \nGinsburg  extended  the  time  to  file  a  petition  for \ncertiorari to April 3, 2017. The petition for certiorari \nwas filed on April 3, 2017. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1254. \n\nFEDERAL RULE OF  \nCIVIL PROCEDURE INVOLVED  \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 provides that \n“[i]n determining foreign law, the court may consider \nany relevant material or source, including testimony, \nwhether  or  not  submitted  by  a  party  or  admissible \nunder  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence.  The  court’s \ndetermination  must  be  treated  as  a  ruling  on  a \nquestion of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1.",
        "2 \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nThis  case  concerns  the  authority  of  the  federal \ncourts  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  accept  an \ninterpretation  of  foreign  law  offered  by  a  foreign \ngovernment when an arm of that government appears \nin court as amicus curiae. Prior to the decision below, \nthe  prevailing  rule  granted  substantial  deference  to \nforeign  sovereign  legal  submissions,  but  left  courts \nwide discretion to scrutinize those submissions in order \nto  ensure  the  accurate  application  of  foreign  law. \nDeparting  from  that  consensus,  the  Second  Circuit \nheld  that  federal  courts  are  “bound  to  defer”  to  an \nappearing  foreign  sovereign’s  characterization  of  its \nown law. There is no legal basis for such a standard. \nAdopting  it  would  threaten  judicial  independence, \ninvite inaccurate applications of foreign law, and allow \nthe enforcement of U.S. laws to turn on the whims of \nforeign  governments  that  have  every  incentive  to \nshield  their  citizens  and  companies  from  liability  in \nU.S. courts.  \n\nPetitioners  brought  this  antitrust  class  action  on \nbehalf of two classes of U.S.-based direct purchasers of \nvitamin  C,  alleging  that  Respondents  and  their  co-\nconspirators fixed prices and restricted supply in their \nexports  of  vitamin  C  to  the  United  States. \nRespondents’ only defense was that Chinese law had \nrequired them to violate the U.S. antitrust laws, and \ntherefore  that  the  doctrines  of  foreign  sovereign \ncompulsion,  act  of  state,  and  international  comity \nrequired dismissal of the complaint.  \n\nRespondents’  central  claim—that  Chinese  law \ncompelled them to fix prices—has always been false. \nThe Chinese government regulated export prices and",
        "3 \n\nvolumes for vitamin C in the past, but it ceased doing \nso by the end of 2001 to facilitate China’s entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization. The governing documents \nadopted  in  2002  describe  a  system  of  voluntary \nindustry  coordination,  and  both \nthe  Chinese \nGovernment and the participants in the scheme sang \nthe same tune prior to this litigation.  \n\nAfter this suit threatened China’s leading vitamin \nC producers with U.S. antitrust liability, the Chinese \nMinistry of Commerce changed its story. Participating \nin  a  joint  defense  agreement  with  Respondents,  the \nMinistry filed an amicus brief at the motion-to-dismiss \nstage  asserting  that  Chinese  law  had  compelled \nRespondents  to  fix  prices  and  output.  Two  different \ndistrict  judges  held  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  was \nentitled  to  “substantial  deference,”  but  was  not \nconclusive  because \nit  failed  to  explain  critical \nregulatory  authorities,  departed  from  the  Ministry’s \nown  source  materials  and  prior  statements  of  the \nChinese  government,  and  could  not  be  squared  with \nRespondents’ contemporaneous statements describing \nthe governing legal regime.  \n\nThe Second Circuit reversed based entirely on the \nMinistry’s  amicus  brief.  The  panel  held  that  the \nDistrict Court’s “careful and thorough treatment of the \nevidence  before  it  .  .  .  would  have  been  entirely \nappropriate,” Pet. App. 30a n.10, but for the Ministry’s \nappearance in the litigation, which by itself convinced \nthe panel that it was “bound to defer” to the Ministry’s \ncharacterization of Chinese law.  \n\nThis Court should reverse the Second Circuit’s rigid \nand arbitrary deference rule. Courts do not surrender \ntheir  duty  or  discretion  to  interpret  foreign  law",
        "4 \n\naccurately simply because a foreign sovereign appears \nwith an amicus brief. The District Court’s respectful \nbut inquisitive approach was correct.  \n\nA.  Factual History  \n\n1.  In  the \n\nlate  1990s,  parallel  private  and \ngovernment  investigations  revealed  a  now  infamous \ncartel  of  thirteen  European  and  Japanese  vitamins \nmanufacturers that had run a decade-long conspiracy \nto fix the prices of twelve different vitamin products, \nincluding vitamin C. It was, according to the Justice \nDepartment, “the most pervasive and harmful criminal \nantitrust conspiracy ever uncovered by the [Antitrust] \nDivision.”1 See Harry First, The Vitamins Case: Cartel \nProsecutions  and \nthe  Coming  of  International \nCompetition Law, 68 Antitrust L.J. 711, 712-19 (2001).  \n\nIn the early 1990s, a sub-cartel of four vitamin C \nproducers—F.  Hofmann-La  Roche  AG,  BASF  AG, \nMerck KgaA, and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd.— \ncontrolled  global  vitamin  C  prices  and  supply. \nCommission Decision No. 2003/2 of 21 November 2001, \n2003  O.J.  (L  6)  1,  38-45  (EC).2  Starting  in  the  mid-\n1990s,  Chinese  vitamin  C  producers  began  to  take \nadvantage of lower manufacturing costs to challenge \nthe cartel—ultimately, the Chinese companies replaced \nthe cartel as the dominant player in the global market. \nPet.

In late 1997, Chinese trade authorities instituted \na  new  regulatory  regime  for  Chinese  vitamin  C \nproduction and export. China’s Ministry of Commerce \n(the  “Ministry”)3  issued  a  regulation  known  as  the \n“1997  Notice,”  JA89-97,  which  declared  that  “[t]he \nscale  of  Vitamin  C  production  shall  be  strictly \ncontrolled,” JA90, and required the China Chamber of \nCommerce of Medicines & Health Products Importers \n&  Exporters \nto  establish  a \n“Coordination  Group”  of  vitamin  C  producers,  JA92. \nThat  group  became  known  as  the  “Vitamin  C \nSubcommittee.” The 1997 Notice required vitamin C \ncompanies to be members of the Subcommittee in order \nto export, and further required the Subcommittee to \ncoordinate  prices  and  output.  JA92.  Under  the  1997 \nNotice, \nthe  Subcommittee  could  penalize  any \n“enterprises competing at low price,” JA92, by reducing \nexport quota or revoking the violator’s right to export. \nJA93.  \n\n“Chamber”) \n\n(the \n\nThe  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee  passed  its  first \ngoverning  charter  in  late  1997  (the  “1997  Charter”). \nJA81-88.

JA108. An internal report prepared \nby one of Respondents’ co-conspirators lamented that \nthroughout 2001, the Chinese vitamin C market was \ncharacterized by “brutally sharp competition, slacked \nperformance, and sustained price decline.” JA521.  \n\nBy  2001,  Chinese  vitamin  C  producers  had \nconsolidated from more than twenty companies to the \nfour  “major  manufacturers”  who,  along  with  their \ncorporate  affiliates,  were  the  original  defendants  in \nthis case.

The  internal  price  war  within  the  vitamin  C \nindustry led the Subcommittee, including Respondents, \nto meet in November 2001, when they agreed to raise \nthe  export  price  of  vitamin  C  to  $3/kg,  effective \nJanuary  1,  2002.  Pet.  App.  79a.  Contemporaneous \naccounts  stated  that  Respondents  reached  this \nagreement  voluntarily  because  “prices  had  reached \nrock bottom, and no one could sustain a further slide,” \nand that the industry had acted on its own “because \nthe  country  had  opened  up  the  commercial  products \nbusiness from a free competition aspect.” Pet. App. 80a; \nPet.  App.  79a-82a.  The  Chamber  announced  the \nthe \nagreement  on \nSubcommittee members  \n\nits  website,  stating \n\nthat \n\nwere  able  to  reach  a  self-regulated  agreement \nsuccessfully,  whereby  they  would  voluntarily \ncontrol  the  quantity  and  pace  of  exports  to \nachieve  the  goal  of  stabilization  while  raising \nexport  prices.  Such  self-restraint  measures, \n‘restricting  quantity  to \nmainly  based  on \nsafeguard prices, export[ing] in a balanced and \norderly  manner  and  adjust[ing]  dynamically’ \nhave  been  completely  implemented  by  each \nenterprises’  own  decisions  and  self-restraint, \nwithout any government intervention.   \n\nPet. App. 173a-174a; JA109. \n\n4. In 2002, China fundamentally reshaped the legal \nregime governing vitamin C exports.  These changes \nwere  part  of  a  larger  deregulation  project  aimed  at",
        "8 \n\nadvancing China’s transition to a market economy in \ngaining entry into the World Trade Organization.  \n\nAmong  other  reforms,  the  Ministry  abolished  the \n1997  Notice.  In  its  place,  the  Ministry  issued  a  new \n“2002  Notice”  that  abolished  the  1997  regime’s  key \nmandates, including (1) that “the scale of Vitamin C \nproduction  shall  be  strictly  controlled,”  (2)  that  the \nvitamin C Subcommittee must fix prices and output, \n(3)  that  all  vitamin  C  exporters  participate  in  and \n“subject  themselves  to  the  coordination  of”  the \nSubcommittee, and (4) that the Subcommittee penalize \nany “enterprises competing at low price and reducing \nprice through any disguised means.” Compare JA90-92 \n(1997 Notice), with JA98-101 (2002 Notice).  \n\nThe 2002 Notice also instituted a new procedure for \nmonitoring vitamin C exports called “price verification \nand  chop.”  JA100.  On  paper,  “verification  and  chop” \nrequired  exporters  to  submit  vitamin  C  export \ncontracts to the Chamber, which was then supposed to \naffix a seal (or “chop”) if the contract met or exceeded \nan industry-determined minimum export price. JA104-\n06.  The  exporter  would  then  present  the  contract  to \nCustoms,  which  was  supposed  to  permit  only  those \nexport contracts with an affixed “chop.” JA103. But the \nNotice did not prohibit exports in the event that the \nSubcommittee  members  declined  to  reach  a  price \nagreement  in  the  first  place.  JA98-101.  Further,  the \n2002 Notice made no mention of requiring or enforcing \noutput restrictions. JA98-101.   \n\nEven on the face of the 2002 Notice, participation in \nverification and chop gave the Chamber’s members the \ndiscretion to opt-out. Specifically, the Notice provided \nthat  “[g]iven  the  drastically  changing  international",
        "9 \n\nmarket, the customs and chambers may suspend export \nprice review for certain products” with approval of the \nrelevant subcommittee.  JA100 (emphasis added).  \n\nThe  Subcommittee,  for  its  part,  repealed  and \nreplaced the 1997 Charter with a new “2002 Charter.” \nJA182-97. The 2002 Charter differed radically from its \npredecessor: it declared that the Subcommittee was an \n“organization jointly established on a voluntary basis,” \n(emphasis  added),  eliminated  the  1997 \nJA182 \nCharter’s  requirement  that  Subcommittee  members \n“[s]trictly execute” the “coordinated price”  set by the \nChamber,  JA182-97,  and  granted  all  members  an \nthe \nexpress \nSubcommittee,”  JA186.  See  JA593-98  (testimony  of \nQiao  Haili,  head  of  the  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee, \nconfirming those changes). \n\n“[r]ight” \n\n“freely \n\nresign \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\nChina’s contemporaneous statements to the WTO \nconfirmed  that  the  new  2002  regime  had  repealed \ngovernment-mandated  vitamin  C  export  price-  and \noutput-restrictions  as  part  of  a  broader  effort  to \nliberalize and reform China’s economy. Significantly, \nChina represented to the WTO that, as of January 1, \n2002, it “gave up export administration of . . . vitamin \nC.” JA319 (emphasis added). In the same statement, \nChina explained that it would still “maintain[] export \nadministration  of  a  small  number  of  products,”  but \nvitamin C was not one of those products. JA319.  \n\n5. Consistent with the reforms to the Subcommittee \nCharter, the contemporaneous evidence showed that \nthe  Chinese  Government  did  not  force  vitamin  C \nexporters to manipulate prices or export volume after \n2002.",
        "10 \n\na.  Exporters  decided  and  implemented  prices \nindependent of government direction or intervention. \nQiao  Haili,  head  of  the  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee, \nadmitted  in  sworn  testimony  that  it  was  “accurate” \nthat  “export  prices  are  fixed  by  enterprises  without \ngovernment  intervention,”  CAJA  A1811;  Pet.  App. \n293a  (emphasis  added),  and  further  that,  “on  the \nwhole, the government did not involve itself in price \nfixing,”  CAJA  A1811.  Meeting  minutes  documenting \nRespondents’ voluntary price and output agreements \nshowed  no  indicia  of  government  compulsion.  See \nCAJA  A2161-A2162 \n(memorializing  price  and \nproduction  agreement  with  no  mention  of  legal \nrequirement); JA407 (same); JA180-81 (same); CAJA \nA2100 (same); CAJA A2105-A2109 (same). Specifically \nas to price, the Chamber in 2003 distributed a list of \nagreed-upon export prices for certain key commodities, \nJA398-400,  requesting  that  Chamber  members \n“[p]lease abide by the list in implementation.” JA398. \nWhile  vitamin  C  was  included  on  the  price  list,  the \ncolumn  for  “agreed  price”  was  left  blank.   JA399.  In \ncontrast, each of the other “key commodities” had an \n“agreed price” listed.  JA399. \n\nb.  When  Respondents  reached  price  agreements, \ncompliance  with  those  agreements  was  entirely \nvoluntary—exporters  routinely  sold  at  prices  both \nbelow  and  above  the  purportedly-mandatory  floors. \nCAJA A2091-A2098 (even though the verification and \nchop price was $3.35, Respondents reached agreements \nto charge higher prices during the class period); JA491-\n92 (exporters “felt free to quote prices lower than the \nagreed floor price” of $9.20/kg, which made the effect of \nthe price floor “very limited”); JA407 (exporters knew \nthat the price limitation would have a “very limited”",
        "11 \n\neffect  because  everyone  went  below  it);  JA512 \n(companies “were able to sell vitamin C for less than \nthe verification and chop price . . . because of the highs \nand lows of the pricing”); JA550 (the Chamber’s “price \ncould  not  be  implemented”  when  there  was  “a  big \nfluctuation”  and  the  price  floor  “was  not  consistent \nwith  the  market  price”);  JA535-36  (Weisheng  sold \nvitamin C in the U.S. at prices “less than the minimum \nprice of $3.35,” because “by that time $3.35 was not the \nmarket price”). \n\nc. The verification and chop process was not treated \nas  mandatory.  For  example,  contracts  Respondents \nproduced revealed that virtually all of the exports to \nthe  U.S.  in  the  class  period  were  shipped  without  a \nchop.  JA512-17;  CAJA  A2267-A2539,  A2565-A2970, \nA3020-A3375, A3431-A3669.  \n\nprices, \n\nd.

App.  249a \n(Qiao admitting that “[n]o company was ever punished \nfor charging less than $3.35.”).   \n\nor \n\ne.  Output  was  not  regulated  by  the  Ministry  or \nChamber  at  all  after  2001.  JA182-97.  Instead, \nRespondents  coordinated  output  restrictions  by \nagreement when doing so was convenient, and by 2003, \nthe  Chamber  had  abandoned  even  the  pretense  of \nregulating  output. JA526  (in a  2003  meeting,  it  was \ndecided  that  “there  would  be  no  limits  on  volume  of \nvitamin  C”);  JA581  (the  Chamber  “did  not  use",
        "12 \n\nverification and chop” or provide “any directions at all” \nfor export volume between March 2003 and July 2006). \n\n6. The leadership of the Chamber acknowledged in \ncontemporaneous  writings  that  Respondents’  cartel \nbehavior was voluntary. In a 2003 memo addressed to \nthe  Ministry,  Qiao  bragged  that  industry  “self-\nregulation”  had  increased  vitamin  C  exports,  but \nfurther observed:   \n\nBuilding  a  credibility  system  cannot  be \nseparated from industry self-regulation and the \nindustry’s  self-regulation  can’t  do  without  the \nchambers  of  commerce.  However,  the  legal \nstanding  of  chambers  of  commerce  is  still  not \nclear.  Regulations  and  rules  formulated  by \ncompanies  in  the  industry  organized  by  the \nchambers of commerce lack legal basis and are \ndifficult  to  gain  support  from  government \ndepartments.  These  rules  and  regulations \nsimply  become  formality  and  only  ‘honest \nfellows  will  follow.’  Therefore  .  .  .  we  need \nlegislation  to  define  the  legal  status  of  the \nchambers  of  commerce.  We  also  need  support \nfrom relevant government departments to assist \nchambers  of  commerce  in  asserting  their \nauthority,  so  that  [the  chambers]  can  punish \ncompanies  who  engage  in  smuggling,  tax \nevasion  or  who  have  little  credibility,  and can \nhonor  those  who  are  trustworthy,  thereby \ncreating  an  environment  for  a  credibility \nindustry.",
        "13 \n\nJA454-55.5  \n\nBy 2004, the Chamber and Subcommittee could not \ncount  on  all  Chinese  producers  and  exporters  of \nvitamin C being members under the 2002 Notice and \nCharter. JA182-97. Vitamin C exporters described the \ngoverning  regime  of  “self-regulation”  as  a  series  of \n“gentlemen’s  agreements.”  JA384.  A  Chinese  official \nsaid in a 2005 speech that although “the [vitamin C] \nenterprises, mediated by [the Chamber], took measures \nlast  year  to  limit  production  to  protect  price  and  to \nensure a ‘soft-landing’ of the price plunge, but in the \nlong run, such allegiance is vulnerable and will easily \nsuccumb to the temptation of profit . . . .” JA409. \n\n7. Respondents’ post-filing conduct also supported \nthe district court’s conclusion that the anticompetitive \nconduct  was  voluntary.  After  Petitioners  filed  their \ncomplaint in January 2005, the Subcommittee decided \nto  stop  keeping  records  of  their  meetings,  and  then \nstopped meeting altogether—despite the supposed legal \nrequirement that they meet to coordinate prices and \noutput. JA592; CAJA A1712. Other evidence suggested \nthat  the  compulsion  defense  was  manufactured  in \n\n5  At  trial,  Qiao  claimed  for  the  first  time  (in  a  radical \ndeparture from his deposition testimony) that this memo referred \nto a breakdown of coordination in the penicillin industry. That \nclaim  was  shown  to  be  fabricated,  not  just  because  of  Qiao’s \nfailure to mention penicillin at any point during his deposition, or \nthe memorandum’s failure to mention the word “penicillin” even \nonce,  but  also  because  the  industry  breakdown  to  which  Qiao \nreferred  did  not  occur  until  months  after  he  had  written  his \nmemorandum.

In support of \nthat  motion,  the  Ministry  filed  an  amicus  brief \ncompelled \nasserting \nRespondents’  conduct.  Pet.  App.  190a.

App.  197a.  For  these  propositions,  the  Ministry \ncited  repeatedly  to  an  outdated  1991  regulation,  as \nwell as the 1997 Charter, which the Ministry failed to",
        "15 \n\ndisclose  had  been  repealed.  Relying  on  the  repealed \n1997 Charter, the Ministry misleadingly asserted that \n“only  Sub-Committee  members  ‘have  the  right  to \nexport Vitamin C and are simultaneously qualified to \nhave Vitamin C export quota.’” Pet. App. 202a-203a. \nThe Ministry’s brief cited additional provisions of the \n1997  Charter  as  though  they  were  still  in  force, \nincluding  repealed  penalties  for  noncompliance  with \nSubcommittee directives and, “[m]ost significantly for \npurposes  of  this  case,”  the  (abolished)  obligation  to \n“‘[s]trictly  execute  export  coordinated  price  set  by  the \nChamber  and  keep  it  confidential.’”  Pet.  App.  203a \n(emphasis in original). In sum, the Ministry failed to \ndisclose  that  its  legal  theory  relied  upon  regulatory \nprovisions that were defunct by 2002. \n\nThe Ministry submitted the repealed 1997 Charter, \nbut not the 2002 Charter, as an exhibit to its amicus \nbrief,  and  neither  the  Ministry  nor  Respondents \ndisclosed  the  existence  of  the  2002  Charter  to  the \ncourt.  Instead,  the  Ministry’s  brief  erroneously \nasserted that the 2002 transition to “verification and \nchop”  was  a  continuation  of  the  earlier  mandatory \nprice  and  output  regime.  In  characterizing  the \n“verification and chop” regime, the Ministry relied only \non those authorities it deemed helpful to its argument, \nsuch as the 2002 Notice and a separate 2003 Ministry \n“Announcement,” but declined to mention or explain \neither the 2002 Charter or the 2002 Notice’s provision \nthat gave the Subcommittee the power to suspend price \nreview. Pet. App. 208a-209a; JA98-101. \n\nAfter  Petitioners \n\nto \nfiled \nRespondents’  motion  to  dismiss,  the  Ministry  filed \nanother  statement  with  the  court.  JA131.  In  that \nit  had \nstatement,  the  Ministry  repeated  that \n\ntheir  opposition",
        "16 \n\n“specifically charged the [Chamber] with the authority \nand  responsibility,  subject  to  Ministry  oversight,  for \nregulating, through consultation, the price of vitamin C \nmanufactured  for  export,”  JA133,  but  omitted  any \nreference to any regulatory authority, and failed to cite \na single instance of government-mandated price-fixing.  \nFurther, the Ministry’s statement made no mention of \noutput restrictions, even in the abstract. The Ministry \ncontinued  to  omit  any  mention  of  the  2002  Charter. \nJA131-33. \n\n3.  After  reviewing  the  Ministry’s  amicus  briefs, \ndocumentary submissions, and some limited discovery, \nthe  District  Court  denied  Respondents’  motion  to \ndismiss. Pet. App. 188a. The court considered evidence \nincluding  post-2002  documents  showing  that  the \nSubcommittee  members  reached  several  voluntary \nagreements  on  price,  and  occasionally  defected  from \nthose agreements without suffering any penalty. Pet. \nApp.  175a-176a.  The  court  also  reviewed  testimony \nfrom  “the  person  responsible  for  negotiating  export \ncontracts” for one of the defendants who “suggest[ed] \nthat  the  hand  of  government  was  not  weighing  as \nheavily on defendants as defendants and the Ministry \nwould have th[e] court believe.” Pet. App. 176a-177a. \nAnd the court reviewed the email from Wang Qi (of co-\nconspirator JJPC), in which he mused that in light of \nthe pending lawsuit, the defendants needed to act “in a \nmore hidden and smart way.” Pet. App. 178a.   \n\nThe District Court recognized that the “authority of \nthe  Ministry’s  brief  [was]  critical  to  defendants’ \nmotion”  to  dismiss.  Pet.  App.  179a.  The  court \nconcluded  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  was  “entitled  to \nsubstantial  deference,  but  [would]  not  be  taken  as \nconclusive evidence of compulsion, particularly where,",
        "17 \n\nas  here,  the  plain  language  of  the  documentary \nevidence  submitted  by  plaintiffs  directly  contradicts \nthe  Ministry’s  position.”  Pet.  App.  181a.  The  court \nexplained  that  “the  record  as  it  stands  is  simply  too \nambiguous  to  foreclose  further  inquiry  into  the \nvoluntariness of defendants’ actions,” and, accordingly, \ndenied the motion to dismiss. Pet. App. 186a & n.12.  \n\n4.  Following  the  close  of  discovery,  Respondents \nrenewed  their  compulsion,  act  of  state,  and  comity \ndefenses in a motion for summary judgment. Pet. App. \n55a.6  The  Ministry  filed  yet  another  statement  (the \n“2009  Statement”),  this  time  asserting  without \ncitations  that  “[d]uring  the  relevant  period  in  the \npresent  case,  the  Ministry  required  vitamin  C \nexporting companies to coordinate among themselves \non export price and production volume,” and that “[n]o \nvitamin  C  exporter  could  ignore  these  policies”  lest \nthey face “penalties for failure to participate in such \ncoordination.” JA249-50. The statement characterized \nChina’s  statements  to  the  WTO  as  mere  “general \ndescriptions  of  the  current  status  of  China’s  market \neconomy”  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  vitamin  C, \nJA250, but declined to explain the portion of China’s \nWTO statement that explicitly referenced  vitamin C \nexports, JA319. \n\nThe District Court denied the motion for summary \njudgment.

In  sum,  the  court \nconcluded that the Ministry’s legal position appeared \nto  be  a  “post-hoc  attempt  to  shield  [Respondents’] \nconduct from antitrust scrutiny rather than a complete \nand straightforward explanation of Chinese law during \nthe relevant time period.” Pet.

Pet. App. 25a, 27a-33a. \n\nthe \n\nInstead,  the  panel  applied  a  legal  standard  that \nturned on the bare fact of the Ministry’s appearance in \nthe litigation.

The panel \nfound  that  the  relevant  parties  and  claims  were  in \nChina,  that  relief  would  be  ineffective  given  China’s \ninsistence that its companies engage in anticompetitive \nconduct,  and  that  the  jury  verdict  risked  upsetting \nU.S.-China relations. Id. The panel did not weigh the \ninterests of U.S. businesses (including Petitioners) and \nconsumers,  the  interests  of  the  United  States  in \nenforcing its antitrust laws, or the Executive Branch’s \nfailure to corroborate China’s claims in the case.",

Petitioners sought panel rehearing and rehearing \nen  banc,  arguing  among  other  things  that  the  panel \nhad  erred  in  granting  conclusive  deference  to  the \nMinistry’s amicus brief, and in only reviewing (after a \nfull  trial  on  the  merits)  the  District  Court’s \ninterlocutory  order  denying  Respondents’  motion  to \ndismiss.

Misc. Order (Jan. 12, \n2018). \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThere is no legal basis for requiring federal courts \nto  accept  as  legally  binding  an  appearing  foreign \nsovereign’s characterization of its own law. Mandating \nthat courts grant binding deference to any particular \nsource  is  the  antithesis  of  the  broad  discretion  Rule \n44.1 commits to courts, and the arbitrary nature of the \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  would  interfere  with  courts’ \nability to reach accurate determinations of foreign law. \nNo precedents from this Court, alternative deference \ndoctrines, or international norms support the adoption \nof such a standard.  \n\nI.  As  a  threshold  issue,  a  standard  of  binding \ndeference cannot be squared with Rule 44.1, which was \ndesigned to afford federal courts maximum flexibility \nin determining foreign law. Rule 44.1 protects federal \ncourts’  discretion  by  instructing  courts  to  treat  the \ndetermination of foreign law as a legal question, and by \npermitting courts to “consider any relevant material or \nsource.” The  Second  Circuit’s  binding  deference",
        "25 \n\nstandard undermines each of these principles. A court \ncannot meaningfully consider and resolve a question of \nforeign  law  if  it  is  forbidden  from  questioning  or \nchallenging \nlegal \nstatement. Nor  is  there  any  legal  justification  for \nmandating  that  U.S.  courts  adopt  interpretations  of \nforeign law that, while reasonable on their face, prove \non close examination to be unpersuasive or inaccurate.  \n\ngovernment’s \n\nforeign \n\na \n\nII. A standard of binding deference standard does \nnot follow from any prior decision of this Court or other \nlegal authority. Specifically, the panel’s reliance on this \nCourt’s  decision  in  United  States  v.  Pink  was \nmisguided. Pink is a narrow decision that did not adopt \na broad prospective rule of deference. Moreover, Pink \nwas primarily concerned with protecting the Executive \nBranch’s  foreign  policy  prerogative  against  state \nintrusion—a concern not implicated here.   \n\nA binding deference standard further conflicts with \ninternational  comity  and  settled \nprinciples  of \ninternational practice. Foreign courts, as well as the \noperative international treaties that speak to the issue, \nuniversally give preference to accuracy over respect for \na statement’s advocate. The Second Circuit’s standard \nabandons the principle of accuracy by demanding that \nU.S. courts accept foreign legal statements even when \nscrutiny reveals that statement to be unpersuasive or \ninaccurate. \n\nafforded \n\nIII.  The  deference  that  the  federal  courts  have \nstate \nto \ntraditionally \nadministrative agencies counsels against the adoption \nof a binding deference standard. Further, the analogy \nto  this  Court’s  decisions  in  Chevron  and  its  progeny \ndoes not support such a standard. Chevron deference is \n\nfederal \n\nand",
        "26 \n\nrooted  in  separation-of-powers  concerns,  which  are \nabsent in the relationship between the judiciary and \nforeign  government  agencies.  Even  if  Chevron  were \ninstructive, the deference it counsels is more nuanced \nand  less  stringent  than  what  the  Second  Circuit’s \nstandard  would  require. Chevron  carves  out  a \ngatekeeping role for courts to decide whether deference \nis  legally  appropriate,  but  that  inquiry  would  be \nprohibited by the Second Circuit’s standard. And while \nChevron  doctrine  permits  courts  to  challenge  an \nagency’s  “convenient  litigation  position,”  the  Second \nCircuit’s  rule  would  forbid  such  a  conclusion  as \noffensive to comity. An attempt to analogize to federal-\ncourt  deference  to  state  agencies  leads  to  the  same \nconclusion—the ordinary standards applied are far less \ndeferential to states than the Second Circuit’s rule is to \nforeign governments.  \n\nIV.  In  the  absence  of  blind  deference  to  the \nMinistry’s amicus brief, no court could plausibly hold \nthat Chinese law required Respondents to engage in \nprice  fixing  and  output  restrictions.  Only  if  all  of \nRespondents’ unlawful conduct was compelled under \nChinese  law  would  dismissal  pass  this  Court’s \nthreshold “true conflict” inquiry in Hartford Fire. 509 \nU.S. at 798-99. Given the lack of any such conflict, the \nDistrict Court’s judgment should have been affirmed.",
        "27 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  A Binding Deference Standard Conflicts with \nand \nthe  Federal  Courts’  Discretion \nResponsibility \nto  Reach  an  Accurate \nDetermination  of  Foreign  Law  Under  Rule \n44.1. \n\nlaw \n\nConsistent with the judiciary’s independent role as \nthe  authoritative \nin  our \ninterpreter  of \nconstitutional order, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n44.1  provides  courts  broad  discretion  to  reach  an \nindependent determination of foreign legal issues by \nreference  to  “any  relevant  material  or  source.”  The \nCourt of Appeals’ “binding deference” standard would \nturn  Rule  44.1  on  its  head  by  privileging  foreign \nsovereign  submissions  above  all  other  sources  of \nforeign law, without respect to the accuracy, merit, or \npersuasiveness  of  the  submission.  Granting  binding \ndeference to foreign sovereigns’ legal statements would \ntherefore  degrade  the  accuracy  and  independence  of \nforeign-law  determinations,  and undermine \nthe \nenforcement of a host of U.S. laws. That result finds no \nsupport from the text or purpose of Rule 44.1, or any of \nthis Court’s precedents. \n\nA.  Rule  44.1  Protects  Courts’  Substantial \nDiscretion  to  Reach  an  Independent  and \nAccurate Determination of Foreign Law.  \n\n1. Rule 44.1 provides that “[i]n determining foreign \nlaw, the court may consider any relevant material or \nsource, including testimony, whether or not submitted \nby  a  party  or  admissible  under  the  Federal  Rules  of \nEvidence.” The Rule was adopted “to furnish Federal \ncourts  with  a  uniform  and  effective  procedure  for \nraising and determining an issue concerning the law of",
        "28 \n\na  foreign  country.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1  advisory \ncommittee’s notes (1966) (Adoption).  \n\nPrior to the enactment of Rule 44.1, foreign law was \nconsidered  to  be  a  question  of  fact  that  had  to  be \nalleged and proved by the parties. See Black Diamond \nS.S.  Corp.  v.  Robert  Stewart  &  Sons,  Ltd.,  336  U.S. \n386, 397 (1949); Talbot v. Seeman, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 1, \n38  (1801).  Courts  were  generally  at  the  mercy  of \nparties’ submissions, and the resulting determinations \ncould  only  be  as  accurate  as  the  materials  provided. \nMeanwhile,  if  a  party  alleged  but  failed  to  prove  an \nissue  of  foreign  law,  the  consequences  could  include \ndefaulting  to  the  law  of  the  forum,  application  of \ngeneric “principles of law,” or dismissal of the action \naltogether. Arthur R. Miller, Federal Rule 44.1 and the \n“Fact”  Approach  to  Determining  Foreign  Law:  Death \nKnell for a Die-Hard Doctrine, 65 Mich. L. Rev. 613, \n692-94 (1967).    \n\n2. This Court recognized courts’ independent duty \nto reach accurate determinations of foreign law long \nbefore Rule 44.1. Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion for \nthe Court in Church v. Hubbart explained that foreign \nlaw inquiries should be guided by “[t]he principle that \nthe best testimony shall be required which the nature \nof the thing admits of.” 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 187, 236-37 \n(1804).  A  century  later,  in  a  case  concerning  the \n“foreign law” of a state, this Court found that courts \nhave  an  independent  duty  to  construe  and  interpret \nstate law even where those laws have been “proved” \nvia  testimony  or  documents.  Eastern  Bldg.  &  Loan \nAss’n  v.  Williamson,  189  U.S.  122,  126-27  (1903) \n(citation  omitted)  (“While  statutes  and  decisions  of \nother  States  are  facts  to  be  proved  .  .  .  their \nconstruction and meaning are for the consideration and",
        "29 \n\njudgment  of  the  courts in  which  they  have  been \nproved,” and “[n]o witness can conclude a court by his \nopinion  of  the  construction  and  meaning  of  statutes \nand  decisions  already  in  evidence.”).  Applying  this \nconcept  to  the  law  of  foreign  nations,  Justice  Story \nobserved that “the object of the proof of foreign laws is \nto enable the Court to instruct the jury what, in point \nof law, is the result from foreign law to be applied. . . .” \nJoseph  Story,  Conflict  of  Laws  § 638,  at  895  (2d  ed. \n1841). Reviewing courts “are therefore to decide what \nis the proper evidence of the laws of a foreign country . \n. . [and] to judge of their applicability, when proved, to \nthe case at hand.” Id.  \n\nIn Fremont v. United States, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 542 \n(1854),  this  Court  confronted  claims  to  land  grants \nfounded on the law of former Mexican territories. The \nCourt  noted  that  although  the  territorial  laws  in \nquestion \ncourt \nas foreign laws, to be decided as a question of fact,” it \nwas nevertheless  \n\n“were  never \n\ntreated  by \n\nthe \n\nundoubtedly  often  necessary  to  inquire  into \n[foreign]  official  customs  and \nforms  and \nusages. . . . And it may sometimes be necessary \nto  seek  information  from  individuals  whose \nofficial  position  or  pursuits  have  given  them \nopportunities of acquiring knowledge. But it has \nalways been held that it is for the court to decide \nwhat  weight  is  to  be  given  to  information \nobtained from any of these sources. It exercises \nthe same discretion and power, in this respect, \nwhich it exercises when it refers to the different \nreported decisions of state courts, and compares \nthem together, in order to make up an opinion",
        "30 \n\nas  to  the  unwritten  law  of  the  State,  or  the \nconstruction given to one of its statutes. \n\nId. at 557 (emphasis added).  \n\nAfter  Fremont,  and  until  the  enactment  of  Rule \n44.1,  lower  courts  generally  understood  that  judges \nhad an independent duty to “find the meaning of the \nforeign  law  as  [they]  would  if  the  meaning  to  be \nascertained  were  that  of  a  deed  or  an  agreement.” \nPetrogradsky  Mejdunarodny  Kommerchesky  Bank  v. \nNat’l  City  Bank  of  New  York,  170  N.E.  479,  483-84 \n(N.Y.  1930)  (Cardozo,  C.J.).  That  said,  many  lower \ncourts  struggled  to  apply  consistent  or  efficient \nprocedural standards in determinations of foreign law. \nMiller,  65  Mich.  L.  Rev.  at  616-17.  Rule  44.1  was \ndesigned to eliminate the antiquated procedural fiction \nthat labeled foreign legal questions as factual issues, \nand  to  replace  formalistic  evidentiary  rules  with \n“maximum  flexibility  about  the  material  to  be \nconsidered and the methodology to be employed.” 9A \nCharles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2444, at 349 (3d ed. 2008).  \n\n3. The desire to enhance the accuracy of the federal \ncourts’  interpretations  of  foreign  law  animated  the \ndecision to shift  from a fact- to a law-based approach. \nSee Miller, 65 Mich. L. Rev. 613. Arriving at a correct \ninterpretation of foreign law may be straightforward in \nsome cases given the wealth of primary and secondary \nmaterials regarding the forum country’s laws, Bodum \nUSA, Inc. v. La Cafetiere, Inc., 621 F.3d 624, 633-34 \n(7th  Cir.  2010)  (Posner,  J.,  concurring),  whereas  in \nother  cases  the  court  may  need  to  engage  in  a  more \ndetailed examination of the “day-to-day realities of the \npractice of law” in a given country, including “the way",
        "31 \n\nin  which  one  branch  of  the  other  country’s  law \ninteracts  with  another,”  id.  at  638-39  (Wood,  J., \nconcurring).  In  all  cases,  the  object  of  a  Rule  44.1 \ninquiry  is  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  interpretation  of \nforeign law.  \n\nRule  44.1  protects  courts’  discretion  to  reach \naccurate interpretations by allowing the consideration \nof “any relevant material, including testimony, without \nregard to its admissibility,” and authorizing courts to \n“engage  in  [their]  own  research  and  consider  any \nrelevant  material  thus  found.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1 \nAdvisory Committee’s Notes (1966) (Adoption); see also \n9A  Wright  &  Miller, Federal  Practice  and  Procedure \n§ 2444  (3d  ed.  2008)  (Rule  44.1  “dissipates  former \ninhibitions  on  judicial  inquiry”  and  allows  judges  to \n“accept  these  materials  and  give  them  whatever \nprobative value he or she thinks they deserve”). Courts \nhave \nstatutes, \nregulations, enforcement actions, statements of public \nofficials,  treatises  and  law  review  articles,  expert \ntestimony, and articles in the popular press. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Mitchell, 985 F.2d 1275, 1280 (4th Cir. \n1993)  (collecting  cases).  In  reviewing  any  of  these \nmaterials, the trial court has broad discretion to accept \nor disregard arguments based on their relative merit \nand  persuasive  value.  9A  Wright  &  Miller,  Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2444. \n\njudicial  precedents, \n\nconsidered \n\nB.

        "32 \n\nFederal  courts  are  not  obliged  to  subordinate  their \nauthority to interpret foreign law to an arm of a foreign \ngovernment simply because that government chooses \nto  appear  as  amicus  curiae  in  pending  litigation.  To \nhold, as the Second Circuit did, that the District Court \nlacked discretion to “challenge [the Ministry’s] official \nrepresentation  to  the  court  regarding  its  laws  or \nregulations” plainly misapprehends the responsibility \nof the federal courts under Rule 44.1 and undermines \nthe  longstanding  interests  in  independence  and \naccuracy that the Rule was designed to protect. Pet. \nApp. 26a.  \n\nAs nearly all courts had held prior to the decision \nbelow, a foreign sovereign’s statement interpreting its \nown  law  is  entitled  to  respect,  but  such  a  statement \nneed  not  (and  should  not)    be  given  “binding”  or \n“conclusive” effect as a matter of law. See United States \nv. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228, 1241 (11th Cir. 2003) (courts \nmay, but are not required to, defer); McKesson HBOC, \nInc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F.3d 1101, 1108-09 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (same);  Access  Telecom,  Inc.  v.  MCI \nTelecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d  694, 714  (5th Cir.  1999) \n(same). Courts have almost uniformly declined to apply \nconclusive or “binding” deference for several reasons.  \n\n1. The text of Rule 44.1 authorizes trial courts to \n“consider any relevant material or source” in reaching \na determination of foreign law. Binding deference, by \ncontrast, would sometimes require courts to disregard \nmaterials  that  contradict  a \nforeign  sovereign’s \nstatement,  rendering  any  consideration  of  such \nmaterials meaningless. A binding deference standard \nwould therefore re-impose the “inhibitions on judicial \ninquiry”  that  Rule  44.1  sought  to  dismantle,  and \ninterfere with a judge’s prerogative to give foreign legal",
        "33 \n\nmaterials “whatever probative value he or she thinks \nthey  deserve.”  9A  Wright  &  Miller,  Federal  Practice \nand Procedure § 2444.  \n\nThe  discretion  Rule  44.1  commits  to  the  federal \ncourts  cannot  be  overridden  by  a  categorical  rule \nimposed  via  judicial  fiat.  The  Federal  Rules  are \npromulgated  pursuant  to  an  express  congressional \ndelegation of authority, which provides that any “laws \nin conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or \neffect after such rules have taken effect.” 28 U.S.C. § \n2072(b).  As  this  Court  has  held  in  other  contexts, \nwhere  Congress  has  enacted  a  discretionary  regime, \ncourts should not replace that discretion with judge-\nmade categorical rules. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, \nLLC,  547  U.S.  388,  392-94  (2006).  That  principle \napplies with equal force to the decision below, which \nimposed  its  categorical  deference  rule  based  upon \nprinciples of comity that are plainly not “a matter of \nabsolute  obligation.”  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.S.  113, \n163-64 (1895). \n\n2. A rule that requires binding deference to foreign \nsovereign statements regardless of persuasiveness or \naccuracy is in tension with the mandate in Rule 44.1 \nthat  courts  engage  in  a  legal  (rather  than  factual) \ninquiry. Factual inquiries are limited— the factfinder \n(be it a jury or judge) cannot introduce new facts into \nthe record, and is therefore dependent upon the parties \nto  identify  the  relevant  witnesses  and  documents  to \nestablish the truth or falsity of relevant allegations. By \ncontrast, legal inquiries, including the one required by \nRule 44.1, require the reviewing court to construe law \naccurately—subject to de novo review on appeal—but \ngrant  courts  considerable  discretion  to  consider  and \ngive weight to whatever sources of law best address the",
        "34 \n\nquestion  presented.  Thus,  courts  applying  Rule  44.1 \nshould  not  be  constrained  by  whether  a  legal \ninterpretation  is  offered  by  a  plaintiff,  defendant, \nexpert witness, or foreign government amicus brief—\nthe  rule    grants  courts  the  discretion  to  perform \nresearch  sua  sponte  and  “to  reexamine  and  amplify \nmaterial  that  has  been  presented  by  counsel  in \npartisan fashion or in insufficient detail.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 44.1 advisory committee’s notes (1966) (Adoption).10 \nBecause  the  Second  Circuit’s  standard  turns  on  the \nidentity  of  the  party  offering  the  foreign  legal \ninterpretation, rather than the content of the offered \ninterpretation,  it  upends  the  purpose  of  Rule  44.1. \namicus \n\nThe Second Circuit compounded its error by holding \nthat the mere appearance of a foreign sovereign before \nthe court mandates greater deference than is owed to \nstatements  of  sovereigns  that  do  not  appear.11  That \nrule  is  incoherent:  a  legal  statement  offered  by  a \n\n10  To  be  sure,  there  are  circumstances  in  which  certain \ndeference  regimes  operate  to  cabin  legal  inquiries,  but  those \ncircumstances are the exception rather than the rule, and courts \nhave eschewed conclusive or binding deference standards except \nwhere they are necessary to satisfy constitutional separation of \npowers principles. See infra, at 47-55.  \n\n11 Pet. App. 30a n.10 (the District Court’s holding would have \nbeen  “entirely  appropriate”  had  the  Chinese  Government  “not \nappeared  in  this  litigation”);  Pet.  App.  23a  (distinguishing  an \nearlier  case  because  the  “Chilean  Government  did  not  appear \nbefore  the  court  in  that  case,”  so  the  “deference  [that]  court \nafforded  the  Chilean  affidavit  does  not  guide  our  application \nhere”); Pet. App. 25a (courts are “bound to defer” where a foreign \ngovernment “directly participates in U.S. court proceedings”).",
        "35 \n\nforeign government prior to, or outside the context of, \nongoing  litigation  is  far  less  likely  to  be  biased,  and \nmore likely to be accurate, than a statement offered by \na  sovereign  that  is  seeking  to  influence  ongoing \nlitigation.  Cf.  Pet.  App.  236a-237a  (disclosing  the \nMinistry’s  joint  defense  agreement  and  “very  strong \ninterest aligned with the defendants in the case”); Pet. \nApp. 120a (noting that the Ministry’s 2009 statement \n“reads like a carefully crafted and phrased litigation \nposition”). Yet courts following the panel’s rule would \nbe  more \nlegal \ninterpretation contained in a litigation statement than \none appearing in an independent statement made prior \nto litigation. If affirmed, this deference-on-appearance \nrule  will  incent  the  submission  of  foreign-sovereign \namicus  briefs  asserting  novel  or  unsupported  legal \npositions  whenever  U.S.  litigation  threatens  favored \nforeign companies with liability.  \n\ninclined  to  defer  to  a  slanted \n\nA separate but related incoherence in the Second \nCircuit’s  standard  was  its  repeated  reference  to  the \nimportance of the “sworn evidentiary proffer” provided \nby the Ministry. Pet. App. 25a. The only “proffer” in \nthis case was a declaration from the Ministry’s outside \ncounsel at a U.S. law firm, the “sworn” component of \nwhich  amounted  to  representations  relating  to  the \nauthenticity of documents. See Declaration of Joel M. \nMitnick in Support of the Brief of Amicus Curiae the \nMinistry of Commerce of People’s Republic of China, In \nre Vitamin C. Antitrust Litig., 06-md-1738, (E.D.N.Y. \nSept.  22,  2006),  ECF No. 70;  compare,  e.g.,  Mitchell, \n985 F.2d at 1280 (considering, but not deferring to, the \nsworn  affidavit  of  a  Pakistani  official  offering  an \ninterpretation  of  Pakistani  law).  It  is  impossible  to \ndiscern why the submission of a declaration from an",
        "36 \n\nattorney  at  a  foreign  government’s  U.S.  law  firm \nshould be relevant, let alone dispositive, to the level of \nlegal \ndeference  provided  to  that  government’s \ninterpretation.  \n\nthat \n\nlaws \n\ntheir \n\ncompelled \n\n3. Granting “binding” deference to foreign sovereign \nlegal statements risks undermining the enforcement of \nU.S.  laws.  Most  obviously,  the  standard  would \nundermine both government and private enforcement \nof  the  antitrust  laws  against  foreign  cartels  selling \nproducts  in  the United  States.  The  panel’s  approach \nwould immunize plain violations of U.S. antitrust laws \nanytime  a  foreign  government  appears  in U.S.  court \nthe \nand  asserts \nanticompetitive conduct. Such a regime would permit \nopportunistic foreign governments to misconstrue their \nlaws to shield their citizens and businesses from U.S. \nlitigation. Liability for foreign anticompetitive conduct \ncan  turn  on  whether  the  foreign  government  merely \nencouraged or allowed the conduct, in which case there \nis liability, or actually compelled the conduct, in which \ncase there is not. Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide \n& Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 706–07 (1962). Under \nthe  panel’s  approach,  foreign  governments  could \ndictate  dismissal  of  an  otherwise  valid  claim  by \nasserting  for  the  first  time  in  an  amicus  brief  that \nforeign  laws  compel  anticompetitive  conduct  even \nwhere those laws, on their face, do nothing more than \npermit it. Cf. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 798-99.",
        "37 \n\nWhen, as here, some or all of a cartel’s members are \ndirectly or indirectly state-owned,12 or partly owned by \ngovernment  officials, foreign  companies  are  likely  to \nfind willing sovereign partners to provide legal cover. \nPet.  App.  88a  n.19  (employee  of  conspiring  company \nnoting,  with  respect  to  this  litigation,  that  “[e]ven  if \n[defendants] lost the case, the government would take \nthe foremost part of the responsibility”). As the District \nCourt  found,  the  cartel  of  Chinese  exporters  in  this \ncase,  having  persuaded  the  Ministry  to  take  a  self-\ninterested position at odds with the text of the relevant \nregulatory  authorities  and  China’s  prior  public \nstatements,  represents  this  fear  fully  realized.  Pet. \nApp.  122a  (“Although  the  Ministry  encouraged \ndefendants’  cartel  and  now  fervently  desires  that \ndefendants  be  dismissed  from  this  suit,  those  policy \npreferences do not establish that Chinese law ‘required’ \ndefendants \nanti-competitive \nto \npredilections.”). \n\nfollow \n\ntheir \n\nThe risks of a “binding deference” standard extend \nbeyond the antitrust context. Foreign sovereigns are \noften  sued  under  the  Foreign  Sovereign  Immunities \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1602 et seq., and questions of foreign \nlaw frequently arise under that act. U.S. courts also \ndecide foreign law questions in a wide variety of other \ncontexts such as the recognition of foreign judgments, \ne.g.,  de  Fontbrune  v.  Wofsy,  838  F.3d  992  (9th  Cir. \n2016) (applying French law to decide whether a foreign \ntherefore \ncompensatory, \njudgment  was \n\nand \n\n12  See  Br.  in  Opposition  at  iii  (June  5,  2017)  (corporate \n\ndisclosure statement).",
        "38 \n\nenforceable,  under  California  law),  and  private \ntransnational disputes in which foreign governments \nhave a strong interest, e.g. Republic of Turkey v. OKS \nPartners,  797  F.  Supp.  64  (D.  Mass  1993)  (denying \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss suit by Turkey to recover \nancient  coins  over  which  Turkey  claimed  ownership \nunder  Turkish  law).  All  of  these  areas  would  be \nvulnerable to mischief under the decision below.  \n\n4. A “binding deference” standard also would invite \nmanipulation of the federal courts. Foreign sovereigns \nmay sue as plaintiffs in federal courts, Banco Nacional \nde Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1964), and \nquestions  of  foreign  law  (and  deference  to  foreign \ngovernments’  interpretations  of  that  law)  frequently \narise  in  such  suits,  e.g.  McKesson  Corp.  v.  Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, 672 F.3d 1066 (D.C. Cir. 2012); Pet. \n24. The Second Circuit’s standard could invite foreign \ngovernments to sue in U.S. court knowing that the U.S. \nstandard  of  binding  deference  to  its  legal  position \nwould  allow  them  to  engineer  a  result  in  our  courts \nthat could not be assured in their own. Further, foreign \ncompanies  could  bring  claims  involving  novel  or \nunsupported applications of foreign law, but prevail in \nU.S. court simply by convincing a friendly government \nagency  to  file  an  amicus  brief  supporting  the \ninterpretation.    \n\nThis  case  demonstrates  the  accuracy  costs  that \nwould be imposed by a binding deference standard.  By \naccepting, without scrutiny, the Ministry’s statement \nas binding, the panel embraced a statement that the \nDistrict Court had found to be ambiguous, inconsistent \nwith and contradicted by the record, and less than fully \nhonest. Supra at 16-19. The Second Circuit’s binding \ndeference  standard  undermines  the  central  task",
        "39 \n\nafforded  to  courts  by  Rule  44.1:    to  determine  and \napply the correct foreign law.   \n\nII.  There Is No Legal Basis for Requiring the \n\nApplication of Binding Deference.  \n\nNeither  of  the  two  bases  on  which  the  Second \nCircuit relied—this Court’s decision in United States v. \nPink  and  the  doctrine  of  international  comity—\nsupports  a  standard  of  binding  deference  to  foreign \ngovernments’ legal statements.  \n\nA.  This  Court’s  Precedents  Do  Not  Support \n“Conclusive” \n\nthe  Application  of  a \nDeference Standard Under Rule 44.1. \n\nThe Second Circuit misread this Court’s decision in \nUnited States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203 (1942), to require \nthe application of “conclusive” deference to “an official \nstatement  or  declaration  from  a  foreign  government \nclarifying its laws.” Pet. App. 20a, 25a. Pink announced \nno  such  rule,  and  even  if  it  had,  the  rule  would  not \ncontrol the outcome of this case.  \n\n1. Pink arose out of the nascent Soviet government’s \n1918 nationalization of Russian insurance companies. \nAt  that  time,  the  New  York  superintendent  of \ninsurance took possession of the assets of First Russian \nInsurance Company, which had operated in New York \nbefore  nationalization,  and  still  held  the  funds  as  of \n1933,  when  the  United  States  recognized  the  USSR \nand executed the “Litvinov Assignment,” in which the \nUSSR assigned claims for “amounts . . . that may be \nfound  to  be  due  it,  as  the  successor  of  prior \nGovernments of Russia . . . from American nationals, \nincluding corporations” to the U.S. government. Id. at \n212.  Accordingly, in 1934  the  United  States  brought \nsuit to recover First Russian’s assets from New York’s",
        "40 \n\nthen-Superintendent,  Louis  Pink,  claiming  an \nentitlement  under  the  Litvinov  Assignment  to  the \nfunds. Id. at 211.  \n\nAmong other defenses, Pink claimed that the 1918 \nnationalization decree “had no extraterritorial effect, \naccording  to  Russian  law.”  Id.  at  214.  While  the \nlitigation was pending, the U.S. government requested \nthat the Russian “Commissariat for Foreign Affairs” \nobtain and transmit through “diplomatic channels” an \n“official declaration by the Commissariat for Justice” \nclarifying the decree’s intended extraterritorial effect. \nId. at 218-19. \n\nThe  Commissariat  for  Justice  responded  to  the \nExecutive  Branch’s  request  by  producing  an  official \ndeclaration  that  the  decree  did  have  extraterritorial \neffect  under  Russian  law.  Id.  at  219-220.  And, \ncrucially,  this  Court  noted  that  “the  referee  in”  an \nearlier case, Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of N.Y. & \nTrust Co., 20 N.E.2d 758 (N.Y. 1939), had found, “and \nthe  evidence  supported  his \nthe \nCommissariat  for  Justice  ha[d]  power  to  interpret \nexisting  Russian  law.”  Id.  at  220  (emphasis  added). \n“That being true,” this Court found the Commissariat’s \nofficial declaration “conclusive so far as the intended \nextraterritorial effect of the Russian decree.” Id. at 221 \n(emphasis added). \n\nfinding, \n\nthat \n\n2.  This  Court  in  Pink  determined  that  it  did  not \nneed  to  review  “all  the  evidence  in  the  voluminous \nrecord of the Moscow case.” Id. at 218. This was not \nbecause  the  Court  was  obliged  to  defer  to  the \nCommissariat  as  a  matter  of  law,  but  because  the \n“expert testimony tendered by the United States gave \ngreat credence to its position” about the effect of the",
        "41 \n\nnationalization  decree  and  Commissariat’s  power  to \ninterpret it. Id. At no point did this Court hold that a \nforeign  government’s  declaration  of  foreign  law  is \nalways conclusive; nor did this Court announce a rule \nthat such declarations should presumptively be treated \nas  such.  Because  Pink  offered  no  prospective  rule  of \ndeference,  its  acceptance  of  the  Commissariat’s \ninterpretation of Russian law cannot be separated from \nthe  case’s  context,  including:  (1)  the  Court’s  finding \nthat the Commissariat had power to interpret Russian \nlaw;  (2)  the  recognition  that  the  Commissariat  had \nsubmitted its interpretation in response to an explicit \ninvitation from the U.S. Executive Branch; and (3) a \nwealth  of  record  evidence  that  confirmed  that \ninterpretation.  See  id.  at  241  (Frankfurter,  J., \nconcurring)  (“The  controlling  history  of  the  Soviet \nregime and of this country’s relations with it must be \nread  between  the  lines  of  the  Roosevelt-Litvinov \nAgreement. One needs to be no expert in Russian law \nto  know  that  the  expropriation  decrees  intended  to \nsweep the assets of Russian companies taken over by \nthat government into Russia’s control no matter where \nthose assets were credited.”). \n\nFurther, the substantive dispute in Pink involved \nweighty separation-of-powers concerns, including the \nPresident’s power as the “sole organ” of foreign affairs \nto recognize the validity of foreign governments. See \nPink, 315 U.S. at 229, (explaining that the Executive’s \nactive  participation  in  the  litigation,  on  the  heels  of \ngranting  diplomatic  recognition  to  the  USSR  and \nnegotiating  a \nits \ngovernment,  implicated  the  President’s  Recognition \npower  and  his  status  as  the  “sole  organ”  of  foreign \naffairs) (citing United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export \n\ncomprehensive \n\ntreaty  with",
        "42 \n\nCorp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)). This case, by contrast, \ndoes not implicate the Executive’s recognition power or \na foreign legal statement solicited and endorsed by the \nU.S.  government  in  the  course  of  its  diplomatic \nactivities.  Instead,  the  United  States  has  urged  this \nCourt  to  hold  that  the  Ministry’s  legal  statement \nshould not be granted conclusive deference, just as the \nUnited States does not receive conclusive deference for \nits legal statements offered in foreign courts. Br. for \nthe United States as Amicus Curiae at 11-12 (certiorari \nstage) (Nov. 14, 2017) (“U.S. Invitation Br.”).  \n\n3. To the extent Pink could be read to stand for a \ngeneral  proposition  regarding  the  standard  of \ndeference  owed  to  foreign  sovereigns,  that  standard \ncould not apply absent a threshold showing that the \nspecific  arm  of  foreign  government  “has  power  to \ninterpret”  the  foreign  law  at  issue.  Yet  even  that \nreading  of  Pink  would  produce  an  unworkable \nstandard given that the antecedent inquiry of who has \nthe power to issue an authoritative interpretation of \nforeign  law  is  itself  a  question  of  foreign  law.  A \ndoctrine of conclusive deference to authoritative foreign \nlegal  statements  would  thus  send  courts  into  an \ninterpretive hall of mirrors that this Court’s decision in \nPink did not contemplate, let alone intend. \n\nHere,  unlike  Pink,  there  was  no  evidence,  and \ncertainly  not  “well  supported”  evidence,  that  the \nMinistry has the power to interpret Chinese law. From \nthe time this litigation was filed until it was appealed \nto  the  Second  Circuit,  the  Ministry  made  no  such \nclaim—instead, the Ministry claimed only that it is the \nhighest  Chinese  authority  empowered  to  regulate \nforeign  trade,  Pet.  App.  6a,  168a,  190a.  When  the \nMinistry  eventually  claimed  for  the  first  time  on",
        "43 \n\nappeal to possess law-interpreting power, the Ministry \ncited  no  authority  in  support  of  its  claim.

Thus,  even  under  the  panel’s  expansive \ninterpretation  of  Pink,  the  Ministry  would  not  be \nentitled to binding deference.  \n\nB.  International Comity Does Not Support a \nStandard  of  Binding  Deference  to  a \nForeign Government’s Legal Statements.  \n\nInternational  comity,  which  is  the  basis  for \ndeference to foreign law in the United States, William \nS. Dodge, International Comity in American Law, 115 \nColum. L. Rev. 2071, 2072 (2015), neither requires nor \nsupports  a  standard  of  binding  deference  to  foreign \nsovereign legal statements.  \n\n1. Despite its name, international comity doctrines \nare a matter of domestic law, and “are generally not \nrequired by international law.” Id. at 2074 & nn.22-24. \nThus,  even  at  the  apex  of  comity-based  deference  to \nforeign law, such deference remains a “voluntary act of \nthe nation by which it is offered.” Bank of Augusta v. \nEarle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 589 (1839). A U.S. court \nmay,  for  example,  decline  to  apply  foreign  law  that \nchoice-of-law  principles  would  otherwise  mandate  if \nthe foreign law contravenes a strong public policy of \nthe  forum.  Id.  (“The  comity  thus  extended  to  other \nnations  is  no  impeachment  of  sovereignty.  It  is  the \nvoluntary act of the nation by which it is offered; and is \ninadmissible when contrary to its policy, or prejudicial \nto its interests.”); Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \nConflict of Laws § 25, at 31 (2d ed. 1841).",
        "44 \n\nof \n\nForeign \n\n2. International comity is satisfied by a standard of \ndeference  that  prioritizes  accuracy,  reliability,  and \njudicial  independence.  See  3  Imre  Zajtay,  The \nApplication \nInternational \nLaw, \nEncyclopedia \nof  Comparative  Law,  Private \nInternational  Law  14-24  (Kurt  Lipstein  ed.,  2011) \n(“When the rules of the conflict of laws of the lex fori \nrequire  the  application  of  foreign  law,  they  clearly \nrequire  that  it  should  be  applied  correctly  . . . .”). \nComity  among  the  several  States,  as  expressed \nthrough U.S. conflict-of-laws principles, requires only \nthat the States endeavor to apply one another’s laws \naccurately. E.g., Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571, 591 \n(1953) (“The purpose of a conflict-of-laws doctrine is to \nassure  that  a  case  will  be  treated  in  the  same  way \nunder the appropriate law regardless of the fortuitous \ncircumstances which often determine the forum.”). And \nthis Court has recognized that the States, as “members \nof the same great political family” owe one another a \n“greater  degree  of  comity” than international  comity \nrequires among foreign nations. Bank of Augusta, 38 \nU.S. (13 Pet.) at 590; cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, \n424-26 (1979). International comity should not require \nmore.    See  Donald  Earl  Childress  III,  Comity  as \nConflict: Resituating International Comity as Conflict \nof  Laws,  44  U.C.  Davis  L.  Rev.  11 \n(2010) \n(“[I]nternational  comity  encourages  U.S.  courts  to \napply foreign law in appropriate cases . . . .”).  \n\ncomity \n\nAlthough \n\ninternational \n\nincorporates \nprinciples of “reciprocal tolerance and goodwill,” Société \nNationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale  v.  United  States \nDist.  Court  for  S.  Dist.  Of  Iowa,  482  U.S.  522,  555 \n(1987) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part), there is no reciprocity interest in adopting a",
        "45 \n\nbinding  deference  standard.  To  the  contrary,  such  a \nstandard  would  be  an  international  outlier.  As  the \nSolicitor General has explained, the U.S. “is not aware \nof  any  foreign-court  decision  holding  that  the \nDepartment’s representations” about the meaning of \nU.S.  law  are  entitled  to  “conclusive”  deference,  U.S. \nInvitation  Br.  at  11-12,  and  the  Justice  Department \nexpects  a  standard  of  deference  in  step  with  the \naccuracy principle underlying conflict-of-laws doctrine. \nId.; supra, at 44.  \n\n3. None of the dominant international agreements \nsupport a binding deference standard. Large majorities \nof European nations and of North, Central, and South \nAmerican  nations  have  formalized  their  respective \npractices  in  two  major  treaties,  each  of  which \nestablishes a system for requesting opinions on foreign \nlegal questions from the appropriate government while \nexplicitly providing that those opinions do not bind the \nreceiving country.13 Notably, both treaties also require \ntheir  signatories  to  establish  a  single,  centralized \nauthority  to  receive  and  act  on  requests  from  other \nnations’ tribunals, to ensure that each country speaks \n\n13 The European Convention on Information on Foreign Law, \nart. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 154 (“European Convention”); \nInter-American  Convention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on \nForeign  Law,  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  O.A.S.T.S.

Analogous  Deference  Doctrines  Counsel \n“Binding” \nAgainst \nApplication \nDeference  to  Foreign  Sovereign  Legal \nStatements.  \n\nof \n\nto \n\nThe Second Circuit’s rigid rule of binding deference \ncannot  be  squared  with  the  more  flexible  deference \nstandards \nlegal \nthat  courts  have  applied \ninterpretations offered by federal and state agencies, \nand even state courts. Unlike foreign sovereigns, the \nExecutive Branch and organs of state governments are \nentitled  to  respect  not  just  as  a  matter  of  comity—\ninstead, the deference they are owed derives from the \nConstitution’s allocation of powers between and among \nfederal  and  state  governments.  However  important \n“the spirit of cooperation in which a domestic tribunal \napproaches the resolution of cases touching the laws \nand interests of other sovereign states” may be, Société \nNationale,  482  U.S.  at  543  n.27,  that  spirit  cannot \njustify  privileging  the  representations  of  foreign",
        "48 \n\ngovernments over the official representations of U.S. \nfederal and state governments.   \n\nA.  Principles  of  Chevron  Deference  Do  Not \nSupport a Rule of Binding Deference. \n\nSome  courts  have  attempted  to  analogize  to \ndeference principles deriving from Chevron U.S.A., Inc. \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), in \narticulating the standard of deference due to foreign \ngovernment legal interpretations. E.g., Access Telecom, \n197 F.3d at 714; In re Oil Spill, 954 F.2d 1279, 1312 \n(7th  Cir.  1992).  But  the  Chevron  doctrine  cannot  be \nsensibly  applied  to  foreign  government  statements \noffered  under  Rule  44.1  and,  in  any  event,  firmly-\nestablished  Chevron  principles  would  preclude  the \napplication  of  “binding”  deference  to  the  Ministry’s \nstatement in this case.  \n\n1.  Chevron  requires  courts  to  defer  to  an \nadministrative agency’s reasonable interpretation of an \nambiguous  statute  that  Congress  has  charged  the \nagency  with  administering.  467  U.S.  at  843-44  (“[A] \ncourt  may  not  substitute  its  own  construction  of  a \nstatutory  provision  for  a  reasonable  interpretation \nmade  by  the  administrator  of  an  agency.”).  The  rule \ngives  effect  to  Congress’s  decision  to  allocate \ninterpretive  authority  to  federal  agencies.  Encino \nMotorcars,  LLC  v.  Navarro,  136  S.  Ct.  2117,  2125 \n(2016).  Deference  is  not  required  because  agencies \nhave superior expertise in statutory interpretation, but \nbecause  courts  respect  Congress’s  constitutional \nauthority to decide that “[s]tatutory ambiguities will be \nresolved,  within \nreasonable \ninterpretation,  not  by  the  courts  but  by  the \nadministrative agency.” City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, \n\nthe  bounds \n\nof",
        "49 \n\n569  U.S.  290,  296  (2013).  As  such,  “for  Chevron \ndeference  to  apply,  the  agency  must  have  received \ncongressional  authority  to  determine  the  particular \nmatter at issue in the particular manner adopted.” Id. \nat 306 (citing United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. \n218 (2001)).  \n\nis \n\nrole \n\nlaw-making \n\nThe deference that the Judicial Branch owes to its \ncoordinate  branches  of  government  under  the \nConstitution is different, in both degree and kind, than \nthe  respect  that  U.S.  courts  must  show  to  foreign \nsovereigns. The judiciary’s obligation to refrain from \nusurping  Congress’s \na \nconstitutional command that derives from the powers \nallocated  under  Articles  I  and  III,  as  well  as  the \nSupremacy  Clause  of  Article  VI.  By  contrast,  the \nrespect  owed  to  foreign  sovereigns  derives  from \ndiscretionary  principles  of  international  comity.  See \nHilton, 159 U.S. at 163-64. In the context of a foreign \nsovereign’s  legal  statement,  Congress  has  made  no \ndelegation to the sovereign that could plausibly require \nan Article III court to refrain from exercising its duty \nto  answer  a  question  of  law.  Chevron  thus  fails  to \nprovide a useful guide for evaluating foreign sovereign \nlegal statements. \n\n2. Even on its own terms, Chevron counsels against \nlegal \na  rule  of  “binding”  deference  to  foreign \nsubmissions. Chevron has several distinct steps, all of \nwhich the Second Circuit’s standard would discard in \nfavor of a standard that is far more deferential than \nthe respect that is owed to U.S. agencies. \n\na.  Deference  cannot  even  be  considered  under \nChevron  unless  it  is  first  established  that “Congress \ndelegated authority to the agency generally to make",
        "50 \n\nrules  carrying  the  force  of  law,  and  that  the  agency \ninterpretation claiming deference was promulgated in \nthe exercise of that authority.” Mead, 533 U.S. at 226. \nIf  that  requirement  has  been  satisfied,  a  reviewing \ncourt must then engage in a statutory interpretation \nexercise to determine whether the relevant statute is \n“silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” \nand  if  so,  whether  the  agency’s  interpretation  is  a \n“permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, 467 \nU.S. at 843. The reviewing court—which remains the \n“final authority on issues of statutory construction”—\nmust  first  employ  “traditional  tools  of  statutory \nconstruction”  to  determine  whether  the  statute  is \nambiguous on the “precise question at issue,” and that \nCongress has thereby implicitly delegated interpretive \nauthority to the agency. Id. at 843 n.9. This step of the \nChevron inquiry is often outcome-determinative. See, \ne.g., Kingdom Tech., Inc. v. United States, 136 S. Ct. \n1969, 1979 (2016). \n\nthat  a \n\nChevron’s threshold inquiries do not fit within the \nSecond  Circuit’s  standard.  Though  the  Court  of \nAppeals  allowed \nforeign  government’s \nevidentiary  “proffer”  must  be  “reasonable  under  the \ncircumstances presented,” Pet. App. 25a, it held that if \n“deference  by  any  measure  is  to  mean  anything,  it \nmust mean that a U.S. court not embark on a challenge \nto a foreign government’s official representation to the \ncourt regarding its laws or regulations.” Id. at 25a-26a. \nThe  inability  to  “challenge”  a  foreign  government’s \nconstruction of a foreign statute is incompatible with a \ncourt’s  duty  under  Chevron,  and  would  leave  courts",
        "51 \n\nwith  far  less  discretion  than  they  possess  when \nreviewing  the  legal  interpretations  of  the  U.S. \nExecutive Branch.16 \n\nThe Second Circuit compounded its error by holding \nthat the mere fact of a foreign sovereign’s appearance \n(as amicus) automatically triggers a stronger form of \ndeference. Pet. App. 30a n.10. That holding cannot be \nsquared  with  the  principle  that  deference \nis \nappropriate  only  when  “the  agency  interpretation \nclaiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of \n. . .  authority,”  granted  by  Congress,  “to  make  rules \ncarrying the force of law.” Mead, 533 U.S. at 226-27. \nUnder Mead, the fact that an agency shows up in court \ndoes  not  mean  its  interpretation  is  worthy  of \ndeference—the  relevant  question  is  whether  the \nagency’s submission relies upon legally-binding rules \nthat  the  agency  was  authorized  to  issue.  See \nChristensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) \n(holding that interpretations promulgated in “opinion \nletters  . . .  policy  statements,  agency  manuals,  and \nenforcement guidelines” are instead “entitled to respect \n. . . , but only to the extent that those interpretations \nhave  the  ‘power  to  persuade.’”  (quoting  Skidmore  v. \nSwift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)). The question \n\n16 For example, this Court has explained that “the meaning \nattributed  to  treaty  provisions  by  [executive]  agencies  charged \nwith  their  negotiation  and  enforcement  is  entitled  to  great \nweight,”  but  is  “not  conclusive.”  Sumimoto  Shoji  Am.,  Inc.  v. \nAvagliano, 457 U.S. 176, 184-85 (1982). The Second Circuit’s rule \nwould accordingly grant foreign agencies more deference than the \nU.S. Department of State receives on the same question of treaty-\ninterpretation.",
        "52 \n\nwhether  an  agency  has  appeared  (as  a  party  or  an \namicus) is irrelevant to whether the agency’s proposed \nlegal interpretation carries the “force of law.”17 \n\nb. Beyond Chevron’s threshold inquiries, there are \nmany  scenarios  under  which  the  Second  Circuit’s \nstandard  would  require  deference  when  Chevron’s \nframework  would  refuse  it.  For  example,  Chevron \npermits  courts  to  consider  “the  consistency  of  an \nagency’s position [as] a factor in assessing the weight \nthat  position  is  due,”  Good  Samaritan  Hosp.  v. \nShalala,  508  U.S.  402,  417  (1993),  and  “[a]n  agency \ninterpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts \nwith the agency’s earlier interpretation is entitled to \nconsiderably  less  deference  than  a  consistently  held \nagency view,” INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, \n\n17 Even under a framework relying upon Auer deference, see \nAuer  v.  Robbins,  519  U.S.  452  (1997),  the  Second  Circuit’s \n“binding deference” standard is inappropriate. Auer deference is \n“undoubtedly inappropriate, for example, when [1] the agency’s \ninterpretation  is  plainly  erroneous  or  [2]  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation” being interpreted, “[3] when there is reason to suspect \nthat the agency’s interpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair \nand considered judgment on the matter in question,” as when “[4] \nthe agency’s interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation, or \n[5] when it appears that the interpretation is nothing more than a \nconvenient  litigating  position,  or  [6]  a  post  hoc  rationalization \nadvanced  by  an  agency  seeking  to  defend  past  agency  action \nagainst attack.” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 \nU.S.  142,  155  (2012)  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). The “binding deference” standard would forbid the kind \nof  inquiry  that  any  court  must  perform  under  Auer,  and  the \ninquiry that this Court described in Christopher is precisely the \nkind of inquiry in which the District Court engaged. Supra, at 16-\n19.",
        "53 \n\n446 n.30 (1987). Though an agency may shift positions, \nit  must  “cogently  explain  why  it  has  exercised  its \ndiscretion  in  a  given  manner,”  as  with  any  other \nagency  decision,  and  “the  basis  articulated  by  the \nagency  itself,”  not  “appellate  counsel’s  post  hoc \nrationalizations,” must satisfy the court, Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 48, 50 (1983). By contrast, the Second \nCircuit’s standard would foreclose the examination of a \nsovereign’s  prior  statements  when  those  statements \nappear outside the four corners of the sovereign’s brief. \nSee Pet. App. 28a-30a & n.9 (holding that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by examining and weighing \nevidence  of  prior  Ministry  statements  and  policies \nevincing  voluntariness,  as  well  as  contradictory \nstatements such as China’s statement to the WTO that \nit “gave up export administration of . . . vitamin C” as \nof January 1, 2002, Pet. App. 74a).  \n\nFurther, this Court’s Chevron cases have held that \n“[d]eference to what appears to be nothing more than \nan  agency’s  convenient  litigating  position”  would  be \n“entirely  inappropriate.”  Bowen  v.  Georgetown  Univ. \nHosp., 488 U.S. 204, 213 (1988). As the Bowen Court \nexplained:  \n\nWe  have  never  applied  [Chevron  deference]  to \nagency  litigating  positions  that  are  wholly \nunsupported \nor \nadministrative  practice.  .  .  .  ‘Congress  has \ndelegated to the administrative official and not \nto  appellate  counsel  the  responsibility  for \nelaborating and enforcing statutory commands.’  \n\nregulations, rulings, \n\nby \n\nId. at 212 (quoting Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp, 401 \nU.S. 617, 628 (1971)). Yet the Second Circuit held that",
        "54 \n\nthe District Court abused its discretion in holding that \nthe Ministry’s interpretation of Chinese law amounted \nto a “carefully crafted and phrased litigating position.” \nPet. App. 120a.  \n\n3.  To  the  extent  that  this  Court’s  Chevron  cases \ninform the question presented, the relevance is limited \nto cases where this Court has considered how to weigh \nmaterials to which there is no legal obligation to defer. \nIn such circumstances, this Court has recognized the \nvalue  in  “[t]he  well-reasoned  views  of  the  agencies \nimplementing a statute,” which “‘constitute a body of \nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and \nlitigants may properly resort for guidance.’” Mead, 533 \nU.S. 227 (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 642 \n(1998)).  \n\nThis Court has highlighted certain guideposts for \nreviewing  courts:  absent  an  obligation  to  defer,  the \nweight  given  to  an  agency  construction  of  law  “will \nits \ndepend  upon  the  thoroughness  evident \nconsideration,  the  validity  of  its  reasoning,  its \nconsistency  with  earlier  and  later  pronouncements, \nand all those factors which give it power to persuade, if \nlacking power to control.” Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140. \nEven  before  Skidmore,  courts  adopted  similar \nreasoning  in  the  context  of  determining  foreign  law. \nE.g.,  Petrogradsky  Mejdunarodny  Kommerchesky \nBank, 170 N.E. at 483-84 (Cardozo, C.J.).  \n\nin \n\nPetitioners  agree  with  the  United  States  that \namong the factors articulated above, other factors that \ngive a foreign government’s statement the “power to \npersuade” \n“clarity, \nthoroughness,  and  support;  its  context  and  purpose; \nthe authority of the entity making it; its consistency \n\nstatement’s \n\ninclude \n\nthe",

The  Level  of  Deference  Granted  to  State \nEntities  Counsels  Against  Binding \nDeference to Foreign Governments.  \n\nA  standard  of  “binding  deference”  also  finds  no \nsupport in the tradition of federal-court deference to \narms of state governments, and would result in foreign \ngovernmental  entities  receiving  more  deferential \ntreatment  than  a  sovereign  state.  The  Constitution \nrequires  the  opposite  balance.  Bank  of  Augusta,  38 \nU.S. (13 Pet.) at 590; see Bond v.

Houseman,  93  U.S.  130,  136-37  (1876). \nDespite  the  respect  that  sovereign  states  are  owed, \nincluding the principle that states are the final arbiters \nof their own law, this Court has long held that only the \nhighest court in a given state is entitled to conclusive \ndeference  to  the  interpretation  of  that  state’s  own \nlaws—by  contrast,  the  decisions  of \nlower  and \nintermediate state courts receive only “some weight” \nand are not “controlling” in federal court. See Comm’r \nof Internal Revenue v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, \n465  (1967);  King  v.  Order  of  United  Commercial \nTravelers  of  Am.,  333  U.S.  153,  160-61  (1948).  By \nanalogy to that practice, courts have long held that the \ndecisions of foreign intermediate courts should not be \ntaken  as  authoritative  statements  of  foreign  law  in \nU.S. court. Yone Suzuki v. Cent. Argentine Ry., 27 F.2d \n795, 800 (2d Cir. 1928) (holding that the court was not \nbound  by  an  Argentinian  intermediate  appellate \ncourt’s interpretation of Argentinian maritime law). \n\nSimilarly, federal courts have long held that state \nadministrative  agencies  are  entitled  to  “substantial \ndeference”  when  interpreting  their  own  regulations, \nbut not “binding deference” that would preclude any \nchallenge to a state’s proffered interpretation. E.g. City \nof Bangor v. Citizens Commc’ns Co., 532 F.3d 70, 94 \n(1st  Cir.  2008)  (noting  that  federal  courts  “generally \ndefer  to  a  state  agency’s  interpretation  of  those \nstatutes  it  is  charged  with  enforcing”);  Pharm. \nResearch & Mfrs. of Am. v. Meadows, 304 F.3d 1197, \n1207-08  (11th  Cir.  2002)  (granting  “substantial \ndeference”  to  a  state  agency’s  interpretation  of  state \nlaw).  Even  under  such  a  standard,  agency \ninterpretations  that  fail  to  offer  a  “reasoned  and \nconsistent  view”  of  the  agency’s  regulations  are  not",
        "57 \n\nentitled  to  deference,  and  “no  deference”  need  be \ngranted  “to  an  interpretation  put  forth  merely  as  a \nlitigation position.” Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. \nU.S.  Dep’t  of  Energy,  959  F.2d  149,  152-53  (9th  Cir. \n1992).  \n\nWhen  a  state’s  attorney  general  files  an  amicus \nbrief asserting a particular interpretation of state law, \nthis  Court  has  maintained  that  a  federal  court  need \nnot defer to that interpretation. See Clay v. Sun Ins. \nOffice  Ltd.,  363  U.S.  207,  212  (1960)  (the  Court  of \nAppeals appropriately concluded that “it could not, on \nthe available materials, make a confident guess how \nthe Florida Supreme Court would construe the statute” \ndespite the Florida Attorney General’s participation as \namicus  asserting  an  interpretation,  see    id.  at  216 \n(Black, J., dissenting)); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. \nCity of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 30 (1959) (the District \nCourt  did  not  abuse  its  “fair  and  well-considered \njudicial  discretion”  when,  “[c]aught  between  the \nlanguage of an old but uninterpreted statute and the \npronouncement of the Attorney General of Louisiana,” \nit declined to adopt the Attorney General’s view). There \nis no justification for granting greater deference to the \nrepresentative of a foreign trade ministry than is owed \nto the highest law enforcement officials of a state, yet \nthat is precisely the result of the decision below. \n\nIV.  The Second Circuit’s Judgment Should Be \n\nReversed. \n\nAt every stage of this litigation, the District Court \nevaluated  the  Ministry’s  legal  claims  in  light  of  the \ndeveloping record, and determined that Chinese law \ndid  not  compel  all  of  Respondents’  anticompetitive \nconduct.  Pet.  App.  118a-155a,  168a-186a.  That",
        "58 \n\ndetermination was correct. This Court should reverse \nthe panel’s subsequent resuscitation of Respondents’ \ncomity defense.19 \n\nBased solely on the standard of “binding deference” \nthat  it  imposed,  the  Court  of  Appeals  reversed  the \nDistrict  Court’s  otherwise  “entirely  appropriate” \nanalysis of Chinese law that governed the case to final \njudgment.  Pet.  App.  30a  n.10.  Then,  finding  for  the \nfirst time in the litigation that a “true conflict” between \nChinese and U.S. law had existed, the panel devoted \nfive  paragraphs  to  applying  a  ten-factor  “comity \nbalancing  test,”  after  which  it  vacated  the  District \nCourt’s judgment and the jury’s verdict, and reversed \nthe District Court’s order denying Respondents’ motion \nto dismiss. Pet. App. 33a-38a. As the Second Circuit \n\n19 The breadth of the Court of Appeals’ error is evident in its \nindefensible  decision  to  order  the  dismissal  of  Petitioners’ \ncomplaint,  with  prejudice,  without  any  explanation  of  how  the \ncomity doctrine barred adjudication of Petitioners’ distinct claims \nfor  liability  under  the  Sherman  Act.  Petitioners’  advanced  two \nclaims,  each  of  which  was  undisputed:  that  Respondents  (1) \nunlawfully  fixed  export  prices,  including  above  the  verification \nand chop price of $3.35; and (2) unlawfully colluded on output and \nexport volume. Pet. App. 56a. To warrant dismissal, Respondents \nwere required to show that Chinese law compelled them to engage \nin both categories of unlawful conduct. Pet. App. 126a (explaining \nthat “even if Chinese law did involve some compulsion, summary \njudgment would still be denied because Chinese law assuredly did \nnot compel all of defendant’s illegal conduct”). The panel did not \nexplain  how  Chinese  law  compelled  output  restrictions,  or \nRespondents’ numerous agreements to fix prices at specific levels \nabove  the  supposed  minimum  price  of  $3.35.  This  same  error \ninfected  the  panel’s  finding  regarding  Petitioners’  request  for \ninjunctive relief. Pet. App. 36a-37a.",
        "59 \n\nacknowledged, that disposition was compelled entirely \nby its conclusion that the District Court had applied \nthe  incorrect  standard  of  deference,  which  was \ndispositive of the panel’s analysis of Chinese law and \nits  “true  conflict”  analysis  in  general.  Pet.  App.  30a \nn.10, 27a.  \n\nStripped of its erroneous holding that the Ministry’s \nappearance  mandated  conclusive  deference,  all  that \nremains of the panel’s conclusion is its concession that \nthe  District  Court’s  analysis  of  Chinese  law  was \n“entirely appropriate.” Pet. App. 30a n.10. Accordingly, \nshould this Court agree that the Second Circuit should \nnot have applied “binding deference,” there could be no \nplausible  basis  for  comity-based  abstention  from \njurisdiction  over  petitioners’  antitrust  claims.  See \n(comity-based \nHartford  Fire,  509  U.S.  at  798 \nabstention, if ever appropriate, is inappropriate absent \na “true conflict” between foreign and U.S. law); In re \nIcenhower,  757  F.3d  1044,  1051-52  (9th  Cir.  2014) \n(same); Gross v. German Found. Indus. Initiative, 456 \nF.3d  363,  393  (3d  Cir.  2006)  (same);  see  also  Société \nNationale, 482 U.S. at 555 (Blackmun, J., concurring in \npart and dissenting in part) (“whether there is in fact a \ntrue conflict between domestic and foreign law” is “the \nthreshold question in a comity analysis”); U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice & Fed. Trade Comm’n, Antitrust Guidelines for \nInternational Enforcement and Cooperation, § 4.2.2 at \n32  (2017).  This  Court  should  reverse  the  Second \nCircuit’s judgment as to Respondents’ comity defense, \nand remand for further proceedings as to Respondents’ \nremaining defenses.",

App. 1a) is reported at 837 \nF.3d  175.  The  opinion  of  the  United  States  District \nCourt for the Eastern District of New York (Pet. App. \n39a)  denying  Respondents’  renewed  motion  for \njudgment  as  a  matter  of  law  is  unreported  but \navailable  at  2013  WL  6191945.  The  District  Court’s \nopinion  denying  Respondents’  motion  for  summary \njudgment (Pet. App. 54a) is reported at 810 F. Supp. 2d \n522. The District Court’s opinion denying Respondents’ \nmotion to dismiss (Pet. App. 157a) is reported at 584 F. \nSupp. 2d 546. \n\nJURISDICTION \n\nThe  Court  of  Appeals  entered  judgment  on \nSeptember  20,  2016,  and  denied  rehearing  on \nNovember  4,  2016.  On  January  3,  2017,  Justice \nGinsburg  extended  the  time  to  file  a  petition  for \ncertiorari to April 3, 2017. The petition for certiorari \nwas filed on April 3, 2017. This Court has jurisdiction \nunder 28 U.S.C. § 1254. \n\nFEDERAL RULE OF  \nCIVIL PROCEDURE INVOLVED  \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 provides that \n“[i]n determining foreign law, the court may consider \nany relevant material or source, including testimony, \nwhether  or  not  submitted  by  a  party  or  admissible \nunder  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence.  The  court’s \ndetermination  must  be  treated  as  a  ruling  on  a \nquestion of law.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nThis  case  concerns  the  authority  of  the  federal \ncourts  to  decide  whether  or  not  to  accept  an \ninterpretation  of  foreign  law  offered  by  a  foreign \ngovernment when an arm of that government appears \nin court as amicus curiae. Prior to the decision below, \nthe  prevailing  rule  granted  substantial  deference  to \nforeign  sovereign  legal  submissions,  but  left  courts \nwide discretion to scrutinize those submissions in order \nto  ensure  the  accurate  application  of  foreign  law. \nDeparting  from  that  consensus,  the  Second  Circuit \nheld  that  federal  courts  are  “bound  to  defer”  to  an \nappearing  foreign  sovereign’s  characterization  of  its \nown law. There is no legal basis for such a standard. \nAdopting  it  would  threaten  judicial  independence, \ninvite inaccurate applications of foreign law, and allow \nthe enforcement of U.S. laws to turn on the whims of \nforeign  governments  that  have  every  incentive  to \nshield  their  citizens  and  companies  from  liability  in \nU.S. courts.  \n\nPetitioners  brought  this  antitrust  class  action  on \nbehalf of two classes of U.S.-based direct purchasers of \nvitamin  C,  alleging  that  Respondents  and  their  co-\nconspirators fixed prices and restricted supply in their \nexports  of  vitamin  C  to  the  United  States. \nRespondents’ only defense was that Chinese law had \nrequired them to violate the U.S. antitrust laws, and \ntherefore  that  the  doctrines  of  foreign  sovereign \ncompulsion,  act  of  state,  and  international  comity \nrequired dismissal of the complaint.  \n\nRespondents’  central  claim—that  Chinese  law \ncompelled them to fix prices—has always been false. \nThe Chinese government regulated export prices and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\nvolumes for vitamin C in the past, but it ceased doing \nso by the end of 2001 to facilitate China’s entry into the \nWorld Trade Organization. The governing documents \nadopted  in  2002  describe  a  system  of  voluntary \nindustry  coordination,  and  both \nthe  Chinese \nGovernment and the participants in the scheme sang \nthe same tune prior to this litigation.  \n\nAfter this suit threatened China’s leading vitamin \nC producers with U.S. antitrust liability, the Chinese \nMinistry of Commerce changed its story. Participating \nin  a  joint  defense  agreement  with  Respondents,  the \nMinistry filed an amicus brief at the motion-to-dismiss \nstage  asserting  that  Chinese  law  had  compelled \nRespondents  to  fix  prices  and  output.  Two  different \ndistrict  judges  held  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  was \nentitled  to  “substantial  deference,”  but  was  not \nconclusive  because \nit  failed  to  explain  critical \nregulatory  authorities,  departed  from  the  Ministry’s \nown  source  materials  and  prior  statements  of  the \nChinese  government,  and  could  not  be  squared  with \nRespondents’ contemporaneous statements describing \nthe governing legal regime.  \n\nThe Second Circuit reversed based entirely on the \nMinistry’s  amicus  brief.  The  panel  held  that  the \nDistrict Court’s “careful and thorough treatment of the \nevidence  before  it  .  .  .  would  have  been  entirely \nappropriate,” Pet. App. 30a n.10, but for the Ministry’s \nappearance in the litigation, which by itself convinced \nthe panel that it was “bound to defer” to the Ministry’s \ncharacterization of Chinese law.  \n\nThis Court should reverse the Second Circuit’s rigid \nand arbitrary deference rule. Courts do not surrender \ntheir  duty  or  discretion  to  interpret  foreign  law \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 \n\naccurately simply because a foreign sovereign appears \nwith an amicus brief. The District Court’s respectful \nbut inquisitive approach was correct.  \n\nA.  Factual History  \n\n1.  In  the \n\nlate  1990s,  parallel  private  and \ngovernment  investigations  revealed  a  now  infamous \ncartel  of  thirteen  European  and  Japanese  vitamins \nmanufacturers that had run a decade-long conspiracy \nto fix the prices of twelve different vitamin products, \nincluding vitamin C. It was, according to the Justice \nDepartment, “the most pervasive and harmful criminal \nantitrust conspiracy ever uncovered by the [Antitrust] \nDivision.”1 See Harry First, The Vitamins Case: Cartel \nProsecutions  and \nthe  Coming  of  International \nCompetition Law, 68 Antitrust L.J. 711, 712-19 (2001).  \n\nIn the early 1990s, a sub-cartel of four vitamin C \nproducers—F.  Hofmann-La  Roche  AG,  BASF  AG, \nMerck KgaA, and Takeda Chemical Industries Ltd.— \ncontrolled  global  vitamin  C  prices  and  supply. \nCommission Decision No. 2003/2 of 21 November 2001, \n2003  O.J.  (L  6)  1,  38-45  (EC).2  Starting  in  the  mid-\n1990s,  Chinese  vitamin  C  producers  began  to  take \nadvantage of lower manufacturing costs to challenge \nthe cartel—ultimately, the Chinese companies replaced \nthe cartel as the dominant player in the global market. \nPet.

Nov.  23,  2009),  ECF  No.  397-3 \n[“Bernheim Report”].   \n\n2. In late 1997, Chinese trade authorities instituted \na  new  regulatory  regime  for  Chinese  vitamin  C \nproduction and export. China’s Ministry of Commerce \n(the  “Ministry”)3  issued  a  regulation  known  as  the \n“1997  Notice,”  JA89-97,  which  declared  that  “[t]he \nscale  of  Vitamin  C  production  shall  be  strictly \ncontrolled,” JA90, and required the China Chamber of \nCommerce of Medicines & Health Products Importers \n&  Exporters \nto  establish  a \n“Coordination  Group”  of  vitamin  C  producers,  JA92. \nThat  group  became  known  as  the  “Vitamin  C \nSubcommittee.” The 1997 Notice required vitamin C \ncompanies to be members of the Subcommittee in order \nto export, and further required the Subcommittee to \ncoordinate  prices  and  output.  JA92.  Under  the  1997 \nNotice, \nthe  Subcommittee  could  penalize  any \n“enterprises competing at low price,” JA92, by reducing \nexport quota or revoking the violator’s right to export. \nJA93.  \n\n“Chamber”) \n\n(the \n\nThe  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee  passed  its  first \ngoverning  charter  in  late  1997  (the  “1997  Charter”). \nJA81-88. The 1997 Charter provided that “[o]nly the \nmembers  of  the  Sub-Committee  have  the  right  to \nexport  Vitamin  C,”  JA83,  and  obligated  members  to \n“[s]trictly  execute”  the  agreed-upon  export  price  and \n\n3 At this time, the Ministry of Commerce, or “MOFCOM” was \nstill known by its former name, the Ministry of Foreign Trade and \nEconomic Cooperation, or “MOFTEC.” See Pet.

The  1997  Charter  also \nauthorized penalties in the event a member violated \nthe Charter, including “warning, open criticism, and \nthe \neven \nSubcommittee, \neven \ncancel[lation  of]  the  vitamin  export  right  of  such \nviolating member.” JA85-86.  \n\nits  membership” \n“suspen[sion] \n\nrevocation  of \nand \n\nand \n\nin \n\nBetween May 2000 and December 2001, despite the \npurportedly  strict  provisions  of  the  1997  regime, \nChinese vitamin C exporters relied upon market prices \nto engage in a sustained “price war,” which resulted in \nthe  collapse  of  the  export  price  of  vitamin  C  from \n$5.0/kg to $2.8/kg. JA108. An internal report prepared \nby one of Respondents’ co-conspirators lamented that \nthroughout 2001, the Chinese vitamin C market was \ncharacterized by “brutally sharp competition, slacked \nperformance, and sustained price decline.” JA521.  \n\nBy  2001,  Chinese  vitamin  C  producers  had \nconsolidated from more than twenty companies to the \nfour  “major  manufacturers”  who,  along  with  their \ncorporate  affiliates,  were  the  original  defendants  in \nthis case. Pet. App. 159a.4 Alongside this consolidation, \n\n4 Those four manufacturers were Respondent Hebei Welcome \nPharmaceutical  Co.  Ltd.  (“Hebei  Welcome,”);  and  defendants \nJiangsu Jiangshan Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (“JJPC”), later known \nas  “Aland  Neutraceutical  Co.,  Ltd.,”  Pet.

During the \nclass  period—December  1,  2001  to  June  30,  2006—these  four \ncompanies constituted the corporate membership of the Vitamin C \nSubcommittee’s  “Council,”  its  primary  power-center  and  the \n“enforcement \nthe \ncharged  with \nSubcommittee’s resolutions.

Bernheim Report ¶ 43. \n\n3.  The  internal  price  war  within  the  vitamin  C \nindustry led the Subcommittee, including Respondents, \nto meet in November 2001, when they agreed to raise \nthe  export  price  of  vitamin  C  to  $3/kg,  effective \nJanuary  1,  2002.  Pet.  App.  79a.  Contemporaneous \naccounts  stated  that  Respondents  reached  this \nagreement  voluntarily  because  “prices  had  reached \nrock bottom, and no one could sustain a further slide,” \nand that the industry had acted on its own “because \nthe  country  had  opened  up  the  commercial  products \nbusiness from a free competition aspect.” Pet. App. 80a; \nPet.  App.  79a-82a.  The  Chamber  announced  the \nthe \nagreement  on \nSubcommittee members  \n\nits  website,  stating \n\nthat \n\nwere  able  to  reach  a  self-regulated  agreement \nsuccessfully,  whereby  they  would  voluntarily \ncontrol  the  quantity  and  pace  of  exports  to \nachieve  the  goal  of  stabilization  while  raising \nexport  prices.  Such  self-restraint  measures, \n‘restricting  quantity  to \nmainly  based  on \nsafeguard prices, export[ing] in a balanced and \norderly  manner  and  adjust[ing]  dynamically’ \nhave  been  completely  implemented  by  each \nenterprises’  own  decisions  and  self-restraint, \nwithout any government intervention.   \n\nPet. App. 173a-174a; JA109. \n\n4. In 2002, China fundamentally reshaped the legal \nregime governing vitamin C exports.  These changes \nwere  part  of  a  larger  deregulation  project  aimed  at \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f8 \n\nadvancing China’s transition to a market economy in \ngaining entry into the World Trade Organization.  \n\nAmong  other  reforms,  the  Ministry  abolished  the \n1997  Notice.  In  its  place,  the  Ministry  issued  a  new \n“2002  Notice”  that  abolished  the  1997  regime’s  key \nmandates, including (1) that “the scale of Vitamin C \nproduction  shall  be  strictly  controlled,”  (2)  that  the \nvitamin C Subcommittee must fix prices and output, \n(3)  that  all  vitamin  C  exporters  participate  in  and \n“subject  themselves  to  the  coordination  of”  the \nSubcommittee, and (4) that the Subcommittee penalize \nany “enterprises competing at low price and reducing \nprice through any disguised means.” Compare JA90-92 \n(1997 Notice), with JA98-101 (2002 Notice).  \n\nThe 2002 Notice also instituted a new procedure for \nmonitoring vitamin C exports called “price verification \nand  chop.”  JA100.  On  paper,  “verification  and  chop” \nrequired  exporters  to  submit  vitamin  C  export \ncontracts to the Chamber, which was then supposed to \naffix a seal (or “chop”) if the contract met or exceeded \nan industry-determined minimum export price. JA104-\n06.  The  exporter  would  then  present  the  contract  to \nCustoms,  which  was  supposed  to  permit  only  those \nexport contracts with an affixed “chop.” JA103. But the \nNotice did not prohibit exports in the event that the \nSubcommittee  members  declined  to  reach  a  price \nagreement  in  the  first  place.  JA98-101.  Further,  the \n2002 Notice made no mention of requiring or enforcing \noutput restrictions. JA98-101.   \n\nEven on the face of the 2002 Notice, participation in \nverification and chop gave the Chamber’s members the \ndiscretion to opt-out. Specifically, the Notice provided \nthat  “[g]iven  the  drastically  changing  international \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f9 \n\nmarket, the customs and chambers may suspend export \nprice review for certain products” with approval of the \nrelevant subcommittee.  JA100 (emphasis added).  \n\nThe  Subcommittee,  for  its  part,  repealed  and \nreplaced the 1997 Charter with a new “2002 Charter.” \nJA182-97. The 2002 Charter differed radically from its \npredecessor: it declared that the Subcommittee was an \n“organization jointly established on a voluntary basis,” \n(emphasis  added),  eliminated  the  1997 \nJA182 \nCharter’s  requirement  that  Subcommittee  members \n“[s]trictly execute” the “coordinated price”  set by the \nChamber,  JA182-97,  and  granted  all  members  an \nthe \nexpress \nSubcommittee,”  JA186.  See  JA593-98  (testimony  of \nQiao  Haili,  head  of  the  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee, \nconfirming those changes). \n\n“[r]ight” \n\n“freely \n\nresign \n\nfrom \n\nto \n\nChina’s contemporaneous statements to the WTO \nconfirmed  that  the  new  2002  regime  had  repealed \ngovernment-mandated  vitamin  C  export  price-  and \noutput-restrictions  as  part  of  a  broader  effort  to \nliberalize and reform China’s economy. Significantly, \nChina represented to the WTO that, as of January 1, \n2002, it “gave up export administration of . . . vitamin \nC.” JA319 (emphasis added). In the same statement, \nChina explained that it would still “maintain[] export \nadministration  of  a  small  number  of  products,”  but \nvitamin C was not one of those products. JA319.  \n\n5. Consistent with the reforms to the Subcommittee \nCharter, the contemporaneous evidence showed that \nthe  Chinese  Government  did  not  force  vitamin  C \nexporters to manipulate prices or export volume after \n2002.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f10 \n\na.  Exporters  decided  and  implemented  prices \nindependent of government direction or intervention. \nQiao  Haili,  head  of  the  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee, \nadmitted  in  sworn  testimony  that  it  was  “accurate” \nthat  “export  prices  are  fixed  by  enterprises  without \ngovernment  intervention,”  CAJA  A1811;  Pet.  App. \n293a  (emphasis  added),  and  further  that,  “on  the \nwhole, the government did not involve itself in price \nfixing,”  CAJA  A1811.  Meeting  minutes  documenting \nRespondents’ voluntary price and output agreements \nshowed  no  indicia  of  government  compulsion.  See \nCAJA  A2161-A2162 \n(memorializing  price  and \nproduction  agreement  with  no  mention  of  legal \nrequirement); JA407 (same); JA180-81 (same); CAJA \nA2100 (same); CAJA A2105-A2109 (same). Specifically \nas to price, the Chamber in 2003 distributed a list of \nagreed-upon export prices for certain key commodities, \nJA398-400,  requesting  that  Chamber  members \n“[p]lease abide by the list in implementation.” JA398. \nWhile  vitamin  C  was  included  on  the  price  list,  the \ncolumn  for  “agreed  price”  was  left  blank.   JA399.  In \ncontrast, each of the other “key commodities” had an \n“agreed price” listed.  JA399. \n\nb.  When  Respondents  reached  price  agreements, \ncompliance  with  those  agreements  was  entirely \nvoluntary—exporters  routinely  sold  at  prices  both \nbelow  and  above  the  purportedly-mandatory  floors. \nCAJA A2091-A2098 (even though the verification and \nchop price was $3.35, Respondents reached agreements \nto charge higher prices during the class period); JA491-\n92 (exporters “felt free to quote prices lower than the \nagreed floor price” of $9.20/kg, which made the effect of \nthe price floor “very limited”); JA407 (exporters knew \nthat the price limitation would have a “very limited” \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f11 \n\neffect  because  everyone  went  below  it);  JA512 \n(companies “were able to sell vitamin C for less than \nthe verification and chop price . . . because of the highs \nand lows of the pricing”); JA550 (the Chamber’s “price \ncould  not  be  implemented”  when  there  was  “a  big \nfluctuation”  and  the  price  floor  “was  not  consistent \nwith  the  market  price”);  JA535-36  (Weisheng  sold \nvitamin C in the U.S. at prices “less than the minimum \nprice of $3.35,” because “by that time $3.35 was not the \nmarket price”). \n\nc. The verification and chop process was not treated \nas  mandatory.  For  example,  contracts  Respondents \nproduced revealed that virtually all of the exports to \nthe  U.S.  in  the  class  period  were  shipped  without  a \nchop.  JA512-17;  CAJA  A2267-A2539,  A2565-A2970, \nA3020-A3375, A3431-A3669.  \n\nprices, \n\nd.  Exporters  faced  no  sanctions  for  exporting  at \nindependently-determined \nfor \nmisrepresenting price levels in their contracts.

App.  249a \n(Qiao admitting that “[n]o company was ever punished \nfor charging less than $3.35.”).   \n\nor \n\ne.  Output  was  not  regulated  by  the  Ministry  or \nChamber  at  all  after  2001.  JA182-97.  Instead, \nRespondents  coordinated  output  restrictions  by \nagreement when doing so was convenient, and by 2003, \nthe  Chamber  had  abandoned  even  the  pretense  of \nregulating  output. JA526  (in a  2003  meeting,  it  was \ndecided  that  “there  would  be  no  limits  on  volume  of \nvitamin  C”);  JA581  (the  Chamber  “did  not  use \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 \n\nverification and chop” or provide “any directions at all” \nfor export volume between March 2003 and July 2006). \n\n6. The leadership of the Chamber acknowledged in \ncontemporaneous  writings  that  Respondents’  cartel \nbehavior was voluntary. In a 2003 memo addressed to \nthe  Ministry,  Qiao  bragged  that  industry  “self-\nregulation”  had  increased  vitamin  C  exports,  but \nfurther observed:   \n\nBuilding  a  credibility  system  cannot  be \nseparated from industry self-regulation and the \nindustry’s  self-regulation  can’t  do  without  the \nchambers  of  commerce.  However,  the  legal \nstanding  of  chambers  of  commerce  is  still  not \nclear.  Regulations  and  rules  formulated  by \ncompanies  in  the  industry  organized  by  the \nchambers of commerce lack legal basis and are \ndifficult  to  gain  support  from  government \ndepartments.  These  rules  and  regulations \nsimply  become  formality  and  only  ‘honest \nfellows  will  follow.’  Therefore  .  .  .  we  need \nlegislation  to  define  the  legal  status  of  the \nchambers  of  commerce.  We  also  need  support \nfrom relevant government departments to assist \nchambers  of  commerce  in  asserting  their \nauthority,  so  that  [the  chambers]  can  punish \ncompanies  who  engage  in  smuggling,  tax \nevasion  or  who  have  little  credibility,  and can \nhonor  those  who  are  trustworthy,  thereby \ncreating  an  environment  for  a  credibility \nindustry. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f13 \n\nJA454-55.5  \n\nBy 2004, the Chamber and Subcommittee could not \ncount  on  all  Chinese  producers  and  exporters  of \nvitamin C being members under the 2002 Notice and \nCharter. JA182-97. Vitamin C exporters described the \ngoverning  regime  of  “self-regulation”  as  a  series  of \n“gentlemen’s  agreements.”  JA384.  A  Chinese  official \nsaid in a 2005 speech that although “the [vitamin C] \nenterprises, mediated by [the Chamber], took measures \nlast  year  to  limit  production  to  protect  price  and  to \nensure a ‘soft-landing’ of the price plunge, but in the \nlong run, such allegiance is vulnerable and will easily \nsuccumb to the temptation of profit . . . .” JA409. \n\n7. Respondents’ post-filing conduct also supported \nthe district court’s conclusion that the anticompetitive \nconduct  was  voluntary.  After  Petitioners  filed  their \ncomplaint in January 2005, the Subcommittee decided \nto  stop  keeping  records  of  their  meetings,  and  then \nstopped meeting altogether—despite the supposed legal \nrequirement that they meet to coordinate prices and \noutput. JA592; CAJA A1712. Other evidence suggested \nthat  the  compulsion  defense  was  manufactured  in \n\n5  At  trial,  Qiao  claimed  for  the  first  time  (in  a  radical \ndeparture from his deposition testimony) that this memo referred \nto a breakdown of coordination in the penicillin industry. That \nclaim  was  shown  to  be  fabricated,  not  just  because  of  Qiao’s \nfailure to mention penicillin at any point during his deposition, or \nthe memorandum’s failure to mention the word “penicillin” even \nonce,  but  also  because  the  industry  breakdown  to  which  Qiao \nreferred  did  not  occur  until  months  after  he  had  written  his \nmemorandum.

In sum, the Ministry failed to \ndisclose  that  its  legal  theory  relied  upon  regulatory \nprovisions that were defunct by 2002. \n\nThe Ministry submitted the repealed 1997 Charter, \nbut not the 2002 Charter, as an exhibit to its amicus \nbrief,  and  neither  the  Ministry  nor  Respondents \ndisclosed  the  existence  of  the  2002  Charter  to  the \ncourt.  Instead,  the  Ministry’s  brief  erroneously \nasserted that the 2002 transition to “verification and \nchop”  was  a  continuation  of  the  earlier  mandatory \nprice  and  output  regime.  In  characterizing  the \n“verification and chop” regime, the Ministry relied only \non those authorities it deemed helpful to its argument, \nsuch as the 2002 Notice and a separate 2003 Ministry \n“Announcement,” but declined to mention or explain \neither the 2002 Charter or the 2002 Notice’s provision \nthat gave the Subcommittee the power to suspend price \nreview. Pet. App. 208a-209a; JA98-101. \n\nAfter  Petitioners \n\nto \nfiled \nRespondents’  motion  to  dismiss,  the  Ministry  filed \nanother  statement  with  the  court.  JA131.  In  that \nit  had \nstatement,  the  Ministry  repeated  that \n\ntheir  opposition \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f16 \n\n“specifically charged the [Chamber] with the authority \nand  responsibility,  subject  to  Ministry  oversight,  for \nregulating, through consultation, the price of vitamin C \nmanufactured  for  export,”  JA133,  but  omitted  any \nreference to any regulatory authority, and failed to cite \na single instance of government-mandated price-fixing.  \nFurther, the Ministry’s statement made no mention of \noutput restrictions, even in the abstract. The Ministry \ncontinued  to  omit  any  mention  of  the  2002  Charter. \nJA131-33. \n\n3.  After  reviewing  the  Ministry’s  amicus  briefs, \ndocumentary submissions, and some limited discovery, \nthe  District  Court  denied  Respondents’  motion  to \ndismiss. Pet. App. 188a. The court considered evidence \nincluding  post-2002  documents  showing  that  the \nSubcommittee  members  reached  several  voluntary \nagreements  on  price,  and  occasionally  defected  from \nthose agreements without suffering any penalty. Pet. \nApp.  175a-176a.  The  court  also  reviewed  testimony \nfrom  “the  person  responsible  for  negotiating  export \ncontracts” for one of the defendants who “suggest[ed] \nthat  the  hand  of  government  was  not  weighing  as \nheavily on defendants as defendants and the Ministry \nwould have th[e] court believe.” Pet. App. 176a-177a. \nAnd the court reviewed the email from Wang Qi (of co-\nconspirator JJPC), in which he mused that in light of \nthe pending lawsuit, the defendants needed to act “in a \nmore hidden and smart way.” Pet. App. 178a.   \n\nThe District Court recognized that the “authority of \nthe  Ministry’s  brief  [was]  critical  to  defendants’ \nmotion”  to  dismiss.  Pet.  App.  179a.  The  court \nconcluded  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  was  “entitled  to \nsubstantial  deference,  but  [would]  not  be  taken  as \nconclusive evidence of compulsion, particularly where, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f17 \n\nas  here,  the  plain  language  of  the  documentary \nevidence  submitted  by  plaintiffs  directly  contradicts \nthe  Ministry’s  position.”  Pet.  App.  181a.  The  court \nexplained  that  “the  record  as  it  stands  is  simply  too \nambiguous  to  foreclose  further  inquiry  into  the \nvoluntariness of defendants’ actions,” and, accordingly, \ndenied the motion to dismiss. Pet. App. 186a & n.12.  \n\n4.  Following  the  close  of  discovery,  Respondents \nrenewed  their  compulsion,  act  of  state,  and  comity \ndefenses in a motion for summary judgment. Pet. App. \n55a.6  The  Ministry  filed  yet  another  statement  (the \n“2009  Statement”),  this  time  asserting  without \ncitations  that  “[d]uring  the  relevant  period  in  the \npresent  case,  the  Ministry  required  vitamin  C \nexporting companies to coordinate among themselves \non export price and production volume,” and that “[n]o \nvitamin  C  exporter  could  ignore  these  policies”  lest \nthey face “penalties for failure to participate in such \ncoordination.” JA249-50. The statement characterized \nChina’s  statements  to  the  WTO  as  mere  “general \ndescriptions  of  the  current  status  of  China’s  market \neconomy”  that  had  nothing  to  do  with  vitamin  C, \nJA250, but declined to explain the portion of China’s \nWTO statement that explicitly referenced  vitamin C \nexports, JA319. \n\nThe District Court denied the motion for summary \njudgment.  Pet.  App.  56a.  Considering  Respondents’ \ncomity  defense,  the  court  concluded  that  dismissal \n\n6  By  this  time,  Judge  Trager  had  passed  away,  and  the \nconsolidated action had been reassigned to Judge Brian M.

California,  509  U.S.  764  (1993),  “[u]nless \n[Respondents’]  price-fixing  was  compelled  by  the \nChinese  government”  creating  a  “true  conflict”  with \nU.S. law. Pet. App. 102a-103a.  \n\nOn the question of Chinese law, the District Court \ncarefully considered the Ministry’s motion-to-dismiss-\nstage  amicus  brief  and  2009  Statement.  Pet.  App. \n118a-122a.  The  court  found  that  the  Ministry’s \nstatements were entitled to respect, and deferred to the \nMinistry’s “explanation of the relationship between the \nMinistry  and  the  Chamber.”  Pet.  App.  118a-119a  & \nn.37.  But  the  District  Court  declined  to  grant \nconclusive  deference  to  the  Ministry’s  submissions, \nbecause  they  contained  gaps  and  ambiguities,  and \nfailed  to  address  “critical  provisions”  of  the  relevant \nlegal regime. Pet. App. 119a. The court also found that \ncertain  of  the  Ministry’s  statements  were  directly \ncontradicted by the documentary evidence before the \ncourt. Pet. App. 121a-122a. \n\nThe court found the Ministry’s 2009 Statement to \nbe “particularly undeserving of deference” because the \nstatement:  (1)  failed  to  cite  to  any  regulatory  or \nstatutory sources “to support its broad assertions about \nthe regulatory system governing vitamin C exports”; \n(2)  “contain[ed]  numerous  ambiguous  terms  and \nphrases,  particularly  with  regard  to  the  penalties \nunder  self-discipline”;  and  (3)  failed  to  offer  any \nexplanation of the differences between the 1997 and \n2002  regimes. As  such,  the  Ministry’s  statement  did \n“not read like a frank and straightforward explanation \nof Chinese law,” but rather “like a carefully crafted and \nphrased litigation position.” Pet. App. 119a-120a. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f19 \n\nThe  District  Court  also  noted  that  the  Ministry \nmade “no attempt to explain China’s representations \n[to the WTO] that it gave up export administration of \nvitamin C, which appear to contradict the Ministry’s \nposition in the instant litigation.” Pet. App. 120a-121a. \nThe  court  further  noted  that  “the  factual  record \ncontradicts the Ministry’s position,” including evidence \nrelating to departures from price floors and production \nagreements.  Pet.  App.  121a.  In  sum,  the  court \nconcluded that the Ministry’s legal position appeared \nto  be  a  “post-hoc  attempt  to  shield  [Respondents’] \nconduct from antitrust scrutiny rather than a complete \nand straightforward explanation of Chinese law during \nthe relevant time period.” Pet. App. 121a-122a.  \n\nHaving declined to treat the Ministry’s submissions \nas conclusive, the District Court relied on “what may \nbe considered the more traditional sources of foreign \nlaw—primarily \ndirectives \nthemselves  as  well  as  the  charter  documents  of  the \n[Vitamin  C]  Subcommittee  and  the  Chamber”—in \nreaching  a  Rule.  44.1  determination  “that  the  [post-\n2001] regime did not compel [Respondents’] conduct.” \nPet.

After the close of evidence, Respondents made an \noral Rule 50(a) motion for judgment as a matter of law, \nin  which  they  pressed  their  act  of  state  and  foreign \nsovereign  compulsion  defenses  (but  omitted  their \ncomity  defense).  Pet.  App.  250a-275a;  Pet.  15.  The \nDistrict Court denied judgment as a matter of law on \neach ground. Pet.

In  a  special  verdict,  the  jury  found  that \nRespondents had failed to prove that their conduct had \nbeen “actually compelled” by the Chinese government \nduring the class period of December 1, 2001 to June 30, \n2006. Pet. App. 278a.  \n\nRespondents moved again for judgment as a matter \nof law, this time on the grounds that the act of state, \nforeign sovereign compulsion, and international comity \ndoctrines barred liability. Pet. App. 41a. The District \nCourt denied that motion. Pet. App. 53a.  \n\n6. Respondents appealed, pressing the same three \narguments. The Ministry filed another amicus brief in \nwhich it asserted for the first time, and without any \nit  “has  unquestioned \nsupporting  citation,  that \nauthority to interpret applicable Chinese law.” Br. for \nAmicus Curiae Ministry of Commerce of the People’s \nRepublic of China at 14 (“2014 Ministry Amicus Br.”), \nDkt. 105, In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litig., No. 13-4791 \n(2d  Cir.  Apr.  14,  2014).  The  Ministry  again  failed  to \ndiscuss the substantive content of the 2002 Charter, \nbut for the first time attempted to justify this omission \nby  saying  that  “[the  Ministry’s]  reliance  on  its  own \nregulation rather than a statement promulgated by its \nsubordinate simply reflects [the Ministry’s] legal view \n\n7 Defendants Weisheng and NEPG settled prior to trial, and \ndefendant JJPC settled during trial.

Supra at 15-16; Pet. App. 202a-203a.  \n\nThe  Ministry  also  argued  for  the  first  time  that \nChina’s 2002 statement to the WTO referred only to \n“export quotas and licenses,” and, separately, that “the \nUnited  States  adopted  exactly  the  same  position  in \nWTO dispute settlement proceedings that MOFCOM \nhas  urged  in  this  case:  after  2002,  China  was  still \nrequiring exporters to abide by a price-setting regime.” \n2014 Ministry Amicus Br. at 28. But this claim, too, \nwas  misleading.  At  the  proceeding  in  question,  the \nUnited  States  had  accused  China  of  maintaining  a \nsystem of “minimum export pricing” specifically over \n“bauxite,  coke,  fluorspar,  manganese,  magnesium, \nsilicon carbide, yellow phosphorus, and zinc,” but not \nthe \nvitamin  C.

Pet.

App.  19a. \nGiven  that  the  “2002  Notice  does  not  explicitly \nmandate price fixing,” the panel explained that “[o]ur \ninterpretation  of  the  record  as  to  Chinese  law  thus \nhinges on the amount of deference that we extend to \nthe  Chinese  Government’s  explanation  of  its  own \nlaws.” Pet. App. 19a-20a. \n\nThe panel held that “when a foreign government, \nacting \nthrough  counsel  or  otherwise,  directly \nparticipates in U.S. court proceedings by providing a \nsworn evidentiary proffer regarding the construction \nand  effect  of  its  laws  and  regulations,  which  is \nreasonable under the circumstances presented, a U.S. \ncourt is bound to defer to those statements.” Pet.

Despite that holding’s apparent \nqualifications,  the  panel  did  not  explain  how  the \n“reasonableness” of the Ministry’s statement was to be \n\n9  Even  though  the  Second  Circuit  purported  to  confine  its \nreview to the motion-to-dismiss record,  Pet. App. 2a-4a nn.2-3, \nthis Court’s review is not so limited. On appeal from Respondents’ \npost-trial motion for judgment as a matter of law, the appropriate \nrecord is the full record as developed through discovery and trial. \nSee  Ortiz  v.  Jordan,  562  U.S.  180,  184  (2011)  (“Once  the  case \nproceeds to trial, the full record developed in court supersedes the \nrecord existing at the time of the [interlocutory] motion,” and “at \nthat stage” and on appeal, a “defense must be evaluated in light of \nthe character and quality of the evidence received in court.”). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f23 \n\nrecord \n\nundermining \n\nassessed, declined to examine contradictory evidence in \nthe \nstatement’s \nreasonableness,  made  no  finding  that  the  Ministry’s \namicus brief constituted a “sworn evidentiary proffer,” \nand ignored whether the Ministry was an authoritative \ninterpreter of Chinese law. Pet. App. 25a, 27a-33a. \n\nthe \n\nInstead,  the  panel  applied  a  legal  standard  that \nturned on the bare fact of the Ministry’s appearance in \nthe litigation. The panel explained that “if the Chinese \nGovernment  had  not  appeared  in  this  litigation,  the \ndistrict court’s careful and thorough treatment of the \nevidence  before  it  in  analyzing  what  Chinese  law \nrequired at both the motion to dismiss and summary \njudgment \nentirely \nstages  would  have  been \nappropriate.”  Pet.  App.  30a  n.10.  But  because  the \nMinistry had appeared, the panel held that the amicus \nbrief was conclusive as to the meaning of Chinese law. \nEven  so,  at  no  point  did  the  panel  explain  how  its \nfinding  of  compulsion  with  respect  to  price  fixing \napplied  to,  and  therefore  required  dismissal  of, \nPetitioners’ claims based upon output restrictions.   \n\nHaving found a “true conflict” between Chinese and \nU.S. law, the panel performed a cursory analysis of the \nremaining comity factors. Pet. App. 33a-37a. The panel \nfound  that  the  relevant  parties  and  claims  were  in \nChina,  that  relief  would  be  ineffective  given  China’s \ninsistence that its companies engage in anticompetitive \nconduct,  and  that  the  jury  verdict  risked  upsetting \nU.S.-China relations. Id. The panel did not weigh the \ninterests of U.S. businesses (including Petitioners) and \nconsumers,  the  interests  of  the  United  States  in \nenforcing its antitrust laws, or the Executive Branch’s \nfailure to corroborate China’s claims in the case.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f24 \n\n7. Petitioners sought panel rehearing and rehearing \nen  banc,  arguing  among  other  things  that  the  panel \nhad  erred  in  granting  conclusive  deference  to  the \nMinistry’s amicus brief, and in only reviewing (after a \nfull  trial  on  the  merits)  the  District  Court’s \ninterlocutory  order  denying  Respondents’  motion  to \ndismiss.  Pet.  App.  280a-297a.  The  Second  Circuit \ndenied  rehearing  and  rehearing  en  banc.  Pet.  App. \n298a. Following briefing on the petition for certiorari, \nincluding a recommendation by the Solicitor General to \ngrant the petition, this Court granted review limited to \nthe second question presented. Misc. Order (Jan. 12, \n2018). \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThere is no legal basis for requiring federal courts \nto  accept  as  legally  binding  an  appearing  foreign \nsovereign’s characterization of its own law. Mandating \nthat courts grant binding deference to any particular \nsource  is  the  antithesis  of  the  broad  discretion  Rule \n44.1 commits to courts, and the arbitrary nature of the \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  would  interfere  with  courts’ \nability to reach accurate determinations of foreign law. \nNo precedents from this Court, alternative deference \ndoctrines, or international norms support the adoption \nof such a standard.  \n\nI.  As  a  threshold  issue,  a  standard  of  binding \ndeference cannot be squared with Rule 44.1, which was \ndesigned to afford federal courts maximum flexibility \nin determining foreign law. Rule 44.1 protects federal \ncourts’  discretion  by  instructing  courts  to  treat  the \ndetermination of foreign law as a legal question, and by \npermitting courts to “consider any relevant material or \nsource.” The  Second  Circuit’s  binding  deference \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f25 \n\nstandard undermines each of these principles. A court \ncannot meaningfully consider and resolve a question of \nforeign  law  if  it  is  forbidden  from  questioning  or \nchallenging \nlegal \nstatement. Nor  is  there  any  legal  justification  for \nmandating  that  U.S.  courts  adopt  interpretations  of \nforeign law that, while reasonable on their face, prove \non close examination to be unpersuasive or inaccurate.  \n\ngovernment’s \n\nforeign \n\na \n\nII. A standard of binding deference standard does \nnot follow from any prior decision of this Court or other \nlegal authority. Specifically, the panel’s reliance on this \nCourt’s  decision  in  United  States  v.  Pink  was \nmisguided. Pink is a narrow decision that did not adopt \na broad prospective rule of deference. Moreover, Pink \nwas primarily concerned with protecting the Executive \nBranch’s  foreign  policy  prerogative  against  state \nintrusion—a concern not implicated here.   \n\nA binding deference standard further conflicts with \ninternational  comity  and  settled \nprinciples  of \ninternational practice. Foreign courts, as well as the \noperative international treaties that speak to the issue, \nuniversally give preference to accuracy over respect for \na statement’s advocate. The Second Circuit’s standard \nabandons the principle of accuracy by demanding that \nU.S. courts accept foreign legal statements even when \nscrutiny reveals that statement to be unpersuasive or \ninaccurate. \n\nafforded \n\nIII.  The  deference  that  the  federal  courts  have \nstate \nto \ntraditionally \nadministrative agencies counsels against the adoption \nof a binding deference standard. Further, the analogy \nto  this  Court’s  decisions  in  Chevron  and  its  progeny \ndoes not support such a standard. Chevron deference is \n\nfederal \n\nand \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f26 \n\nrooted  in  separation-of-powers  concerns,  which  are \nabsent in the relationship between the judiciary and \nforeign  government  agencies.  Even  if  Chevron  were \ninstructive, the deference it counsels is more nuanced \nand  less  stringent  than  what  the  Second  Circuit’s \nstandard  would  require. Chevron  carves  out  a \ngatekeeping role for courts to decide whether deference \nis  legally  appropriate,  but  that  inquiry  would  be \nprohibited by the Second Circuit’s standard. And while \nChevron  doctrine  permits  courts  to  challenge  an \nagency’s  “convenient  litigation  position,”  the  Second \nCircuit’s  rule  would  forbid  such  a  conclusion  as \noffensive to comity. An attempt to analogize to federal-\ncourt  deference  to  state  agencies  leads  to  the  same \nconclusion—the ordinary standards applied are far less \ndeferential to states than the Second Circuit’s rule is to \nforeign governments.  \n\nIV.  In  the  absence  of  blind  deference  to  the \nMinistry’s amicus brief, no court could plausibly hold \nthat Chinese law required Respondents to engage in \nprice  fixing  and  output  restrictions.  Only  if  all  of \nRespondents’ unlawful conduct was compelled under \nChinese  law  would  dismissal  pass  this  Court’s \nthreshold “true conflict” inquiry in Hartford Fire. 509 \nU.S. at 798-99. Given the lack of any such conflict, the \nDistrict Court’s judgment should have been affirmed. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f27 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  A Binding Deference Standard Conflicts with \nand \nthe  Federal  Courts’  Discretion \nResponsibility \nto  Reach  an  Accurate \nDetermination  of  Foreign  Law  Under  Rule \n44.1. \n\nlaw \n\nConsistent with the judiciary’s independent role as \nthe  authoritative \nin  our \ninterpreter  of \nconstitutional order, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure \n44.1  provides  courts  broad  discretion  to  reach  an \nindependent determination of foreign legal issues by \nreference  to  “any  relevant  material  or  source.”  The \nCourt of Appeals’ “binding deference” standard would \nturn  Rule  44.1  on  its  head  by  privileging  foreign \nsovereign  submissions  above  all  other  sources  of \nforeign law, without respect to the accuracy, merit, or \npersuasiveness  of  the  submission.  Granting  binding \ndeference to foreign sovereigns’ legal statements would \ntherefore  degrade  the  accuracy  and  independence  of \nforeign-law  determinations,  and undermine \nthe \nenforcement of a host of U.S. laws. That result finds no \nsupport from the text or purpose of Rule 44.1, or any of \nthis Court’s precedents. \n\nA.  Rule  44.1  Protects  Courts’  Substantial \nDiscretion  to  Reach  an  Independent  and \nAccurate Determination of Foreign Law.  \n\n1. Rule 44.1 provides that “[i]n determining foreign \nlaw, the court may consider any relevant material or \nsource, including testimony, whether or not submitted \nby  a  party  or  admissible  under  the  Federal  Rules  of \nEvidence.” The Rule was adopted “to furnish Federal \ncourts  with  a  uniform  and  effective  procedure  for \nraising and determining an issue concerning the law of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f28 \n\na  foreign  country.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1  advisory \ncommittee’s notes (1966) (Adoption).  \n\nPrior to the enactment of Rule 44.1, foreign law was \nconsidered  to  be  a  question  of  fact  that  had  to  be \nalleged and proved by the parties. See Black Diamond \nS.S.  Corp.  v.  Robert  Stewart  &  Sons,  Ltd.,  336  U.S. \n386, 397 (1949); Talbot v. Seeman, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 1, \n38  (1801).  Courts  were  generally  at  the  mercy  of \nparties’ submissions, and the resulting determinations \ncould  only  be  as  accurate  as  the  materials  provided. \nMeanwhile,  if  a  party  alleged  but  failed  to  prove  an \nissue  of  foreign  law,  the  consequences  could  include \ndefaulting  to  the  law  of  the  forum,  application  of \ngeneric “principles of law,” or dismissal of the action \naltogether.

This Court recognized courts’ independent duty \nto reach accurate determinations of foreign law long \nbefore Rule 44.1. Chief Justice Marshall’s opinion for \nthe Court in Church v. Hubbart explained that foreign \nlaw inquiries should be guided by “[t]he principle that \nthe best testimony shall be required which the nature \nof the thing admits of.” 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 187, 236-37 \n(1804).  A  century  later,  in  a  case  concerning  the \n“foreign law” of a state, this Court found that courts \nhave  an  independent  duty  to  construe  and  interpret \nstate law even where those laws have been “proved” \nvia  testimony  or  documents.

Williamson,  189  U.S.  122,  126-27  (1903) \n(citation  omitted)  (“While  statutes  and  decisions  of \nother  States  are  facts  to  be  proved  .  .  .  their \nconstruction and meaning are for the consideration and \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f29 \n\njudgment  of  the  courts in  which  they  have  been \nproved,” and “[n]o witness can conclude a court by his \nopinion  of  the  construction  and  meaning  of  statutes \nand  decisions  already  in  evidence.”).  Applying  this \nconcept  to  the  law  of  foreign  nations,  Justice  Story \nobserved that “the object of the proof of foreign laws is \nto enable the Court to instruct the jury what, in point \nof law, is the result from foreign law to be applied. . . .” \nJoseph  Story,  Conflict  of  Laws  § 638,  at  895  (2d  ed. \n1841). Reviewing courts “are therefore to decide what \nis the proper evidence of the laws of a foreign country . \n. . [and] to judge of their applicability, when proved, to \nthe case at hand.” Id.  \n\nIn Fremont v. United States, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 542 \n(1854),  this  Court  confronted  claims  to  land  grants \nfounded on the law of former Mexican territories. The \nCourt  noted  that  although  the  territorial  laws  in \nquestion \ncourt \nas foreign laws, to be decided as a question of fact,” it \nwas nevertheless  \n\n“were  never \n\ntreated  by \n\nthe \n\nundoubtedly  often  necessary  to  inquire  into \n[foreign]  official  customs  and \nforms  and \nusages. . . . And it may sometimes be necessary \nto  seek  information  from  individuals  whose \nofficial  position  or  pursuits  have  given  them \nopportunities of acquiring knowledge. But it has \nalways been held that it is for the court to decide \nwhat  weight  is  to  be  given  to  information \nobtained from any of these sources. It exercises \nthe same discretion and power, in this respect, \nwhich it exercises when it refers to the different \nreported decisions of state courts, and compares \nthem together, in order to make up an opinion \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f30 \n\nas  to  the  unwritten  law  of  the  State,  or  the \nconstruction given to one of its statutes. \n\nId. at 557 (emphasis added).  \n\nAfter  Fremont,  and  until  the  enactment  of  Rule \n44.1,  lower  courts  generally  understood  that  judges \nhad an independent duty to “find the meaning of the \nforeign  law  as  [they]  would  if  the  meaning  to  be \nascertained  were  that  of  a  deed  or  an  agreement.” \nPetrogradsky  Mejdunarodny  Kommerchesky  Bank  v. \nNat’l  City  Bank  of  New  York,  170  N.E.  479,  483-84 \n(N.Y.  1930)  (Cardozo,  C.J.).  That  said,  many  lower \ncourts  struggled  to  apply  consistent  or  efficient \nprocedural standards in determinations of foreign law. \nMiller,  65  Mich.  L.  Rev.  at  616-17.  Rule  44.1  was \ndesigned to eliminate the antiquated procedural fiction \nthat labeled foreign legal questions as factual issues, \nand  to  replace  formalistic  evidentiary  rules  with \n“maximum  flexibility  about  the  material  to  be \nconsidered and the methodology to be employed.” 9A \nCharles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2444, at 349 (3d ed. 2008).  \n\n3. The desire to enhance the accuracy of the federal \ncourts’  interpretations  of  foreign  law  animated  the \ndecision to shift  from a fact- to a law-based approach. \nSee Miller, 65 Mich. L. Rev. 613. Arriving at a correct \ninterpretation of foreign law may be straightforward in \nsome cases given the wealth of primary and secondary \nmaterials regarding the forum country’s laws, Bodum \nUSA, Inc. v. La Cafetiere, Inc., 621 F.3d 624, 633-34 \n(7th  Cir.  2010)  (Posner,  J.,  concurring),  whereas  in \nother  cases  the  court  may  need  to  engage  in  a  more \ndetailed examination of the “day-to-day realities of the \npractice of law” in a given country, including “the way \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f31 \n\nin  which  one  branch  of  the  other  country’s  law \ninteracts  with  another,”  id.  at  638-39  (Wood,  J., \nconcurring).  In  all  cases,  the  object  of  a  Rule  44.1 \ninquiry  is  to  arrive  at  an  accurate  interpretation  of \nforeign law.  \n\nRule  44.1  protects  courts’  discretion  to  reach \naccurate interpretations by allowing the consideration \nof “any relevant material, including testimony, without \nregard to its admissibility,” and authorizing courts to \n“engage  in  [their]  own  research  and  consider  any \nrelevant  material  thus  found.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1 \nAdvisory Committee’s Notes (1966) (Adoption); see also \n9A  Wright  &  Miller, Federal  Practice  and  Procedure \n§ 2444  (3d  ed.  2008)  (Rule  44.1  “dissipates  former \ninhibitions  on  judicial  inquiry”  and  allows  judges  to \n“accept  these  materials  and  give  them  whatever \nprobative value he or she thinks they deserve”). Courts \nhave \nstatutes, \nregulations, enforcement actions, statements of public \nofficials,  treatises  and  law  review  articles,  expert \ntestimony, and articles in the popular press. See, e.g., \nUnited States v. Mitchell, 985 F.2d 1275, 1280 (4th Cir. \n1993)  (collecting  cases).  In  reviewing  any  of  these \nmaterials, the trial court has broad discretion to accept \nor disregard arguments based on their relative merit \nand  persuasive  value.  9A  Wright  &  Miller,  Federal \nPractice and Procedure § 2444. \n\njudicial  precedents, \n\nconsidered \n\nB.  Binding  Deference  is  Incompatible  with \nRule 44.1 and Judicial Discretion to Reach \nAccurate \nan \nDetermination of Foreign Law.  \n\nIndependent \n\nand \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  deference  standard \nis \nincompatible with the text and purpose of Rule 44.1. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f32 \n\nFederal  courts  are  not  obliged  to  subordinate  their \nauthority to interpret foreign law to an arm of a foreign \ngovernment simply because that government chooses \nto  appear  as  amicus  curiae  in  pending  litigation.  To \nhold, as the Second Circuit did, that the District Court \nlacked discretion to “challenge [the Ministry’s] official \nrepresentation  to  the  court  regarding  its  laws  or \nregulations” plainly misapprehends the responsibility \nof the federal courts under Rule 44.1 and undermines \nthe  longstanding  interests  in  independence  and \naccuracy that the Rule was designed to protect. Pet. \nApp. 26a.  \n\nAs nearly all courts had held prior to the decision \nbelow, a foreign sovereign’s statement interpreting its \nown  law  is  entitled  to  respect,  but  such  a  statement \nneed  not  (and  should  not)    be  given  “binding”  or \n“conclusive” effect as a matter of law. See United States \nv. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228, 1241 (11th Cir. 2003) (courts \nmay, but are not required to, defer); McKesson HBOC, \nInc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F.3d 1101, 1108-09 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (same);  Access  Telecom,  Inc.  v.  MCI \nTelecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d  694, 714  (5th Cir.  1999) \n(same). Courts have almost uniformly declined to apply \nconclusive or “binding” deference for several reasons.  \n\n1. The text of Rule 44.1 authorizes trial courts to \n“consider any relevant material or source” in reaching \na determination of foreign law. Binding deference, by \ncontrast, would sometimes require courts to disregard \nmaterials  that  contradict  a \nforeign  sovereign’s \nstatement,  rendering  any  consideration  of  such \nmaterials meaningless. A binding deference standard \nwould therefore re-impose the “inhibitions on judicial \ninquiry”  that  Rule  44.1  sought  to  dismantle,  and \ninterfere with a judge’s prerogative to give foreign legal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f33 \n\nmaterials “whatever probative value he or she thinks \nthey  deserve.”  9A  Wright  &  Miller,  Federal  Practice \nand Procedure § 2444.  \n\nThe  discretion  Rule  44.1  commits  to  the  federal \ncourts  cannot  be  overridden  by  a  categorical  rule \nimposed  via  judicial  fiat.  The  Federal  Rules  are \npromulgated  pursuant  to  an  express  congressional \ndelegation of authority, which provides that any “laws \nin conflict with such rules shall be of no further force or \neffect after such rules have taken effect.” 28 U.S.C. § \n2072(b).  As  this  Court  has  held  in  other  contexts, \nwhere  Congress  has  enacted  a  discretionary  regime, \ncourts should not replace that discretion with judge-\nmade categorical rules. See eBay Inc. v. MercExchange, \nLLC,  547  U.S.  388,  392-94  (2006).  That  principle \napplies with equal force to the decision below, which \nimposed  its  categorical  deference  rule  based  upon \nprinciples of comity that are plainly not “a matter of \nabsolute  obligation.”  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.S.  113, \n163-64 (1895). \n\n2. A rule that requires binding deference to foreign \nsovereign statements regardless of persuasiveness or \naccuracy is in tension with the mandate in Rule 44.1 \nthat  courts  engage  in  a  legal  (rather  than  factual) \ninquiry. Factual inquiries are limited— the factfinder \n(be it a jury or judge) cannot introduce new facts into \nthe record, and is therefore dependent upon the parties \nto  identify  the  relevant  witnesses  and  documents  to \nestablish the truth or falsity of relevant allegations. By \ncontrast, legal inquiries, including the one required by \nRule 44.1, require the reviewing court to construe law \naccurately—subject to de novo review on appeal—but \ngrant  courts  considerable  discretion  to  consider  and \ngive weight to whatever sources of law best address the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f34 \n\nquestion  presented.  Thus,  courts  applying  Rule  44.1 \nshould  not  be  constrained  by  whether  a  legal \ninterpretation  is  offered  by  a  plaintiff,  defendant, \nexpert witness, or foreign government amicus brief—\nthe  rule    grants  courts  the  discretion  to  perform \nresearch  sua  sponte  and  “to  reexamine  and  amplify \nmaterial  that  has  been  presented  by  counsel  in \npartisan fashion or in insufficient detail.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP. 44.1 advisory committee’s notes (1966) (Adoption).10 \nBecause  the  Second  Circuit’s  standard  turns  on  the \nidentity  of  the  party  offering  the  foreign  legal \ninterpretation, rather than the content of the offered \ninterpretation,  it  upends  the  purpose  of  Rule  44.1. \namicus \n\nThe Second Circuit compounded its error by holding \nthat the mere appearance of a foreign sovereign before \nthe court mandates greater deference than is owed to \nstatements  of  sovereigns  that  do  not  appear.11  That \nrule  is  incoherent:  a  legal  statement  offered  by  a \n\n10  To  be  sure,  there  are  circumstances  in  which  certain \ndeference  regimes  operate  to  cabin  legal  inquiries,  but  those \ncircumstances are the exception rather than the rule, and courts \nhave eschewed conclusive or binding deference standards except \nwhere they are necessary to satisfy constitutional separation of \npowers principles. See infra, at 47-55.  \n\n11 Pet. App. 30a n.10 (the District Court’s holding would have \nbeen  “entirely  appropriate”  had  the  Chinese  Government  “not \nappeared  in  this  litigation”);  Pet.  App.  23a  (distinguishing  an \nearlier  case  because  the  “Chilean  Government  did  not  appear \nbefore  the  court  in  that  case,”  so  the  “deference  [that]  court \nafforded  the  Chilean  affidavit  does  not  guide  our  application \nhere”); Pet. App. 25a (courts are “bound to defer” where a foreign \ngovernment “directly participates in U.S. court proceedings”). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f35 \n\nforeign government prior to, or outside the context of, \nongoing  litigation  is  far  less  likely  to  be  biased,  and \nmore likely to be accurate, than a statement offered by \na  sovereign  that  is  seeking  to  influence  ongoing \nlitigation.  Cf.  Pet.  App.  236a-237a  (disclosing  the \nMinistry’s  joint  defense  agreement  and  “very  strong \ninterest aligned with the defendants in the case”); Pet. \nApp. 120a (noting that the Ministry’s 2009 statement \n“reads like a carefully crafted and phrased litigation \nposition”). Yet courts following the panel’s rule would \nbe  more \nlegal \ninterpretation contained in a litigation statement than \none appearing in an independent statement made prior \nto litigation. If affirmed, this deference-on-appearance \nrule  will  incent  the  submission  of  foreign-sovereign \namicus  briefs  asserting  novel  or  unsupported  legal \npositions  whenever  U.S.  litigation  threatens  favored \nforeign companies with liability.  \n\ninclined  to  defer  to  a  slanted \n\nA separate but related incoherence in the Second \nCircuit’s  standard  was  its  repeated  reference  to  the \nimportance of the “sworn evidentiary proffer” provided \nby the Ministry. Pet. App. 25a. The only “proffer” in \nthis case was a declaration from the Ministry’s outside \ncounsel at a U.S. law firm, the “sworn” component of \nwhich  amounted  to  representations  relating  to  the \nauthenticity of documents. See Declaration of Joel M. \nMitnick in Support of the Brief of Amicus Curiae the \nMinistry of Commerce of People’s Republic of China, In \nre Vitamin C. Antitrust Litig., 06-md-1738, (E.D.N.Y. \nSept.  22,  2006),  ECF No. 70;  compare,  e.g.,  Mitchell, \n985 F.2d at 1280 (considering, but not deferring to, the \nsworn  affidavit  of  a  Pakistani  official  offering  an \ninterpretation  of  Pakistani  law).  It  is  impossible  to \ndiscern why the submission of a declaration from an \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f36 \n\nattorney  at  a  foreign  government’s  U.S.  law  firm \nshould be relevant, let alone dispositive, to the level of \nlegal \ndeference  provided  to  that  government’s \ninterpretation.  \n\nthat \n\nlaws \n\ntheir \n\ncompelled \n\n3. Granting “binding” deference to foreign sovereign \nlegal statements risks undermining the enforcement of \nU.S.  laws.  Most  obviously,  the  standard  would \nundermine both government and private enforcement \nof  the  antitrust  laws  against  foreign  cartels  selling \nproducts  in  the United  States.  The  panel’s  approach \nwould immunize plain violations of U.S. antitrust laws \nanytime  a  foreign  government  appears  in U.S.  court \nthe \nand  asserts \nanticompetitive conduct. Such a regime would permit \nopportunistic foreign governments to misconstrue their \nlaws to shield their citizens and businesses from U.S. \nlitigation. Liability for foreign anticompetitive conduct \ncan  turn  on  whether  the  foreign  government  merely \nencouraged or allowed the conduct, in which case there \nis liability, or actually compelled the conduct, in which \ncase there is not. Continental Ore Co. v. Union Carbide \n& Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 706–07 (1962). Under \nthe  panel’s  approach,  foreign  governments  could \ndictate  dismissal  of  an  otherwise  valid  claim  by \nasserting  for  the  first  time  in  an  amicus  brief  that \nforeign  laws  compel  anticompetitive  conduct  even \nwhere those laws, on their face, do nothing more than \npermit it. Cf. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 798-99. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f37 \n\nWhen, as here, some or all of a cartel’s members are \ndirectly or indirectly state-owned,12 or partly owned by \ngovernment  officials, foreign  companies  are  likely  to \nfind willing sovereign partners to provide legal cover. \nPet.  App.  88a  n.19  (employee  of  conspiring  company \nnoting,  with  respect  to  this  litigation,  that  “[e]ven  if \n[defendants] lost the case, the government would take \nthe foremost part of the responsibility”). As the District \nCourt  found,  the  cartel  of  Chinese  exporters  in  this \ncase,  having  persuaded  the  Ministry  to  take  a  self-\ninterested position at odds with the text of the relevant \nregulatory  authorities  and  China’s  prior  public \nstatements,  represents  this  fear  fully  realized.  Pet. \nApp.  122a  (“Although  the  Ministry  encouraged \ndefendants’  cartel  and  now  fervently  desires  that \ndefendants  be  dismissed  from  this  suit,  those  policy \npreferences do not establish that Chinese law ‘required’ \ndefendants \nanti-competitive \nto \npredilections.”). \n\nfollow \n\ntheir \n\nThe risks of a “binding deference” standard extend \nbeyond the antitrust context. Foreign sovereigns are \noften  sued  under  the  Foreign  Sovereign  Immunities \nAct, 28 U.S.C. §§ 1602 et seq., and questions of foreign \nlaw frequently arise under that act. U.S. courts also \ndecide foreign law questions in a wide variety of other \ncontexts such as the recognition of foreign judgments, \ne.g.,  de  Fontbrune  v.  Wofsy,  838  F.3d  992  (9th  Cir. \n2016) (applying French law to decide whether a foreign \ntherefore \ncompensatory, \njudgment  was \n\nand \n\n12  See  Br.  in  Opposition  at  iii  (June  5,  2017)  (corporate \n\ndisclosure statement). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f38 \n\nenforceable,  under  California  law),  and  private \ntransnational disputes in which foreign governments \nhave a strong interest, e.g. Republic of Turkey v. OKS \nPartners,  797  F.  Supp.  64  (D.  Mass  1993)  (denying \ndefendants’ motion to dismiss suit by Turkey to recover \nancient  coins  over  which  Turkey  claimed  ownership \nunder  Turkish  law).  All  of  these  areas  would  be \nvulnerable to mischief under the decision below.  \n\n4. A “binding deference” standard also would invite \nmanipulation of the federal courts. Foreign sovereigns \nmay sue as plaintiffs in federal courts, Banco Nacional \nde Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398, 408-09 (1964), and \nquestions  of  foreign  law  (and  deference  to  foreign \ngovernments’  interpretations  of  that  law)  frequently \narise  in  such  suits,  e.g.  McKesson  Corp.  v.  Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, 672 F.3d 1066 (D.C. Cir. 2012); Pet. \n24. The Second Circuit’s standard could invite foreign \ngovernments to sue in U.S. court knowing that the U.S. \nstandard  of  binding  deference  to  its  legal  position \nwould  allow  them  to  engineer  a  result  in  our  courts \nthat could not be assured in their own. Further, foreign \ncompanies  could  bring  claims  involving  novel  or \nunsupported applications of foreign law, but prevail in \nU.S. court simply by convincing a friendly government \nagency  to  file  an  amicus  brief  supporting  the \ninterpretation.    \n\nThis  case  demonstrates  the  accuracy  costs  that \nwould be imposed by a binding deference standard.  By \naccepting, without scrutiny, the Ministry’s statement \nas binding, the panel embraced a statement that the \nDistrict Court had found to be ambiguous, inconsistent \nwith and contradicted by the record, and less than fully \nhonest. Supra at 16-19. The Second Circuit’s binding \ndeference  standard  undermines  the  central  task \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f39 \n\nafforded  to  courts  by  Rule  44.1:    to  determine  and \napply the correct foreign law.   \n\nII.  There Is No Legal Basis for Requiring the \n\nApplication of Binding Deference.  \n\nNeither  of  the  two  bases  on  which  the  Second \nCircuit relied—this Court’s decision in United States v. \nPink  and  the  doctrine  of  international  comity—\nsupports  a  standard  of  binding  deference  to  foreign \ngovernments’ legal statements.  \n\nA.  This  Court’s  Precedents  Do  Not  Support \n“Conclusive” \n\nthe  Application  of  a \nDeference Standard Under Rule 44.1. \n\nThe Second Circuit misread this Court’s decision in \nUnited States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203 (1942), to require \nthe application of “conclusive” deference to “an official \nstatement  or  declaration  from  a  foreign  government \nclarifying its laws.” Pet. App. 20a, 25a. Pink announced \nno  such  rule,  and  even  if  it  had,  the  rule  would  not \ncontrol the outcome of this case.  \n\n1. Pink arose out of the nascent Soviet government’s \n1918 nationalization of Russian insurance companies. \nAt  that  time,  the  New  York  superintendent  of \ninsurance took possession of the assets of First Russian \nInsurance Company, which had operated in New York \nbefore  nationalization,  and  still  held  the  funds  as  of \n1933,  when  the  United  States  recognized  the  USSR \nand executed the “Litvinov Assignment,” in which the \nUSSR assigned claims for “amounts . . . that may be \nfound  to  be  due  it,  as  the  successor  of  prior \nGovernments of Russia . . . from American nationals, \nincluding corporations” to the U.S. government. Id. at \n212.  Accordingly, in 1934  the  United  States  brought \nsuit to recover First Russian’s assets from New York’s \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f40 \n\nthen-Superintendent,  Louis  Pink,  claiming  an \nentitlement  under  the  Litvinov  Assignment  to  the \nfunds. Id. at 211.  \n\nAmong other defenses, Pink claimed that the 1918 \nnationalization decree “had no extraterritorial effect, \naccording  to  Russian  law.”  Id.  at  214.  While  the \nlitigation was pending, the U.S. government requested \nthat the Russian “Commissariat for Foreign Affairs” \nobtain and transmit through “diplomatic channels” an \n“official declaration by the Commissariat for Justice” \nclarifying the decree’s intended extraterritorial effect. \nId. at 218-19. \n\nThe  Commissariat  for  Justice  responded  to  the \nExecutive  Branch’s  request  by  producing  an  official \ndeclaration  that  the  decree  did  have  extraterritorial \neffect  under  Russian  law.  Id.  at  219-220.  And, \ncrucially,  this  Court  noted  that  “the  referee  in”  an \nearlier case, Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of N.Y. & \nTrust Co., 20 N.E.2d 758 (N.Y. 1939), had found, “and \nthe  evidence  supported  his \nthe \nCommissariat  for  Justice  ha[d]  power  to  interpret \nexisting  Russian  law.”  Id.  at  220  (emphasis  added). \n“That being true,” this Court found the Commissariat’s \nofficial declaration “conclusive so far as the intended \nextraterritorial effect of the Russian decree.” Id. at 221 \n(emphasis added). \n\nfinding, \n\nthat \n\n2.  This  Court  in  Pink  determined  that  it  did  not \nneed  to  review  “all  the  evidence  in  the  voluminous \nrecord of the Moscow case.” Id. at 218. This was not \nbecause  the  Court  was  obliged  to  defer  to  the \nCommissariat  as  a  matter  of  law,  but  because  the \n“expert testimony tendered by the United States gave \ngreat credence to its position” about the effect of the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f41 \n\nnationalization  decree  and  Commissariat’s  power  to \ninterpret it. Id. At no point did this Court hold that a \nforeign  government’s  declaration  of  foreign  law  is \nalways conclusive; nor did this Court announce a rule \nthat such declarations should presumptively be treated \nas  such.  Because  Pink  offered  no  prospective  rule  of \ndeference,  its  acceptance  of  the  Commissariat’s \ninterpretation of Russian law cannot be separated from \nthe  case’s  context,  including:  (1)  the  Court’s  finding \nthat the Commissariat had power to interpret Russian \nlaw;  (2)  the  recognition  that  the  Commissariat  had \nsubmitted its interpretation in response to an explicit \ninvitation from the U.S. Executive Branch; and (3) a \nwealth  of  record  evidence  that  confirmed  that \ninterpretation.  See  id.  at  241  (Frankfurter,  J., \nconcurring)  (“The  controlling  history  of  the  Soviet \nregime and of this country’s relations with it must be \nread  between  the  lines  of  the  Roosevelt-Litvinov \nAgreement. One needs to be no expert in Russian law \nto  know  that  the  expropriation  decrees  intended  to \nsweep the assets of Russian companies taken over by \nthat government into Russia’s control no matter where \nthose assets were credited.”). \n\nFurther, the substantive dispute in Pink involved \nweighty separation-of-powers concerns, including the \nPresident’s power as the “sole organ” of foreign affairs \nto recognize the validity of foreign governments. See \nPink, 315 U.S. at 229, (explaining that the Executive’s \nactive  participation  in  the  litigation,  on  the  heels  of \ngranting  diplomatic  recognition  to  the  USSR  and \nnegotiating  a \nits \ngovernment,  implicated  the  President’s  Recognition \npower  and  his  status  as  the  “sole  organ”  of  foreign \naffairs) (citing United States v. Curtiss-Wright Export \n\ncomprehensive \n\ntreaty  with \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f42 \n\nCorp., 299 U.S. 304, 320 (1936)). This case, by contrast, \ndoes not implicate the Executive’s recognition power or \na foreign legal statement solicited and endorsed by the \nU.S.  government  in  the  course  of  its  diplomatic \nactivities.  Instead,  the  United  States  has  urged  this \nCourt  to  hold  that  the  Ministry’s  legal  statement \nshould not be granted conclusive deference, just as the \nUnited States does not receive conclusive deference for \nits legal statements offered in foreign courts. Br. for \nthe United States as Amicus Curiae at 11-12 (certiorari \nstage) (Nov. 14, 2017) (“U.S. Invitation Br.”).  \n\n3. To the extent Pink could be read to stand for a \ngeneral  proposition  regarding  the  standard  of \ndeference  owed  to  foreign  sovereigns,  that  standard \ncould not apply absent a threshold showing that the \nspecific  arm  of  foreign  government  “has  power  to \ninterpret”  the  foreign  law  at  issue.  Yet  even  that \nreading  of  Pink  would  produce  an  unworkable \nstandard given that the antecedent inquiry of who has \nthe power to issue an authoritative interpretation of \nforeign  law  is  itself  a  question  of  foreign  law.  A \ndoctrine of conclusive deference to authoritative foreign \nlegal  statements  would  thus  send  courts  into  an \ninterpretive hall of mirrors that this Court’s decision in \nPink did not contemplate, let alone intend. \n\nHere,  unlike  Pink,  there  was  no  evidence,  and \ncertainly  not  “well  supported”  evidence,  that  the \nMinistry has the power to interpret Chinese law. From \nthe time this litigation was filed until it was appealed \nto  the  Second  Circuit,  the  Ministry  made  no  such \nclaim—instead, the Ministry claimed only that it is the \nhighest  Chinese  authority  empowered  to  regulate \nforeign  trade,  Pet.  App.  6a,  168a,  190a.  When  the \nMinistry  eventually  claimed  for  the  first  time  on \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f43 \n\nappeal to possess law-interpreting power, the Ministry \ncited  no  authority  in  support  of  its  claim.

Thus,  even  under  the  panel’s  expansive \ninterpretation  of  Pink,  the  Ministry  would  not  be \nentitled to binding deference.  \n\nB.  International Comity Does Not Support a \nStandard  of  Binding  Deference  to  a \nForeign Government’s Legal Statements.  \n\nInternational  comity,  which  is  the  basis  for \ndeference to foreign law in the United States, William \nS. Dodge, International Comity in American Law, 115 \nColum. L. Rev. 2071, 2072 (2015), neither requires nor \nsupports  a  standard  of  binding  deference  to  foreign \nsovereign legal statements.  \n\n1. Despite its name, international comity doctrines \nare a matter of domestic law, and “are generally not \nrequired by international law.” Id. at 2074 & nn.22-24. \nThus,  even  at  the  apex  of  comity-based  deference  to \nforeign law, such deference remains a “voluntary act of \nthe nation by which it is offered.” Bank of Augusta v. \nEarle, 38 U.S. (13 Pet.) 519, 589 (1839). A U.S. court \nmay,  for  example,  decline  to  apply  foreign  law  that \nchoice-of-law  principles  would  otherwise  mandate  if \nthe foreign law contravenes a strong public policy of \nthe  forum.  Id.  (“The  comity  thus  extended  to  other \nnations  is  no  impeachment  of  sovereignty.  It  is  the \nvoluntary act of the nation by which it is offered; and is \ninadmissible when contrary to its policy, or prejudicial \nto its interests.”); Joseph Story, Commentaries on the \nConflict of Laws § 25, at 31 (2d ed. 1841).   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f44 \n\nof \n\nForeign \n\n2. International comity is satisfied by a standard of \ndeference  that  prioritizes  accuracy,  reliability,  and \njudicial  independence.  See  3  Imre  Zajtay,  The \nApplication \nInternational \nLaw, \nEncyclopedia \nof  Comparative  Law,  Private \nInternational  Law  14-24  (Kurt  Lipstein  ed.,  2011) \n(“When the rules of the conflict of laws of the lex fori \nrequire  the  application  of  foreign  law,  they  clearly \nrequire  that  it  should  be  applied  correctly  . . . .”). \nComity  among  the  several  States,  as  expressed \nthrough U.S. conflict-of-laws principles, requires only \nthat the States endeavor to apply one another’s laws \naccurately. E.g., Lauritzen v. Larsen, 345 U.S. 571, 591 \n(1953) (“The purpose of a conflict-of-laws doctrine is to \nassure  that  a  case  will  be  treated  in  the  same  way \nunder the appropriate law regardless of the fortuitous \ncircumstances which often determine the forum.”). And \nthis Court has recognized that the States, as “members \nof the same great political family” owe one another a \n“greater  degree  of  comity” than international  comity \nrequires among foreign nations. Bank of Augusta, 38 \nU.S. (13 Pet.) at 590; cf. Nevada v. Hall, 440 U.S. 410, \n424-26 (1979). International comity should not require \nmore.    See  Donald  Earl  Childress  III,  Comity  as \nConflict: Resituating International Comity as Conflict \nof  Laws,  44  U.C.  Davis  L.  Rev.  11 \n(2010) \n(“[I]nternational  comity  encourages  U.S.  courts  to \napply foreign law in appropriate cases . . . .”).  \n\ncomity \n\nAlthough \n\ninternational \n\nincorporates \nprinciples of “reciprocal tolerance and goodwill,” Société \nNationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale  v.  United  States \nDist.  Court  for  S.  Dist.  Of  Iowa,  482  U.S.  522,  555 \n(1987) (Blackmun, J., concurring in part and dissenting \nin part), there is no reciprocity interest in adopting a \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f45 \n\nbinding  deference  standard.  To  the  contrary,  such  a \nstandard  would  be  an  international  outlier.  As  the \nSolicitor General has explained, the U.S. “is not aware \nof  any  foreign-court  decision  holding  that  the \nDepartment’s representations” about the meaning of \nU.S.  law  are  entitled  to  “conclusive”  deference,  U.S. \nInvitation  Br.  at  11-12,  and  the  Justice  Department \nexpects  a  standard  of  deference  in  step  with  the \naccuracy principle underlying conflict-of-laws doctrine. \nId.; supra, at 44.  \n\n3. None of the dominant international agreements \nsupport a binding deference standard. Large majorities \nof European nations and of North, Central, and South \nAmerican  nations  have  formalized  their  respective \npractices  in  two  major  treaties,  each  of  which \nestablishes a system for requesting opinions on foreign \nlegal questions from the appropriate government while \nexplicitly providing that those opinions do not bind the \nreceiving country.13 Notably, both treaties also require \ntheir  signatories  to  establish  a  single,  centralized \nauthority  to  receive  and  act  on  requests  from  other \nnations’ tribunals, to ensure that each country speaks \n\n13 The European Convention on Information on Foreign Law, \nart. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 154 (“European Convention”); \nInter-American  Convention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on \nForeign  Law,  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  O.A.S.T.S.

The  usefulness  of  any \nopinion  on  foreign  law  could  depend  on  the \npersuasiveness of the reasoning in the opinion \nand the sources on which the opinion relies.  \n\nResponse of the United States of America to Feasibility \nStudy on the Treatment of Foreign Law Questionnaire, \nPreliminary Doc.

On  the  contrary,  foreign  courts  generally \nretain  their  independent  authority  to  decide  foreign \nlegal  questions  for  themselves.  See  generally  Yuko \nNishitani,  Treatment  of  Foreign  Law  –  Dynamics \nTowards  Convergence?  (2017)  (compiling  national \nreports on the treatment of foreign law in more than \nthirty countries). \n\nCollectively, by emphasizing judicial independence \nand  their  privileging  of  a  central \ninterpretive \nauthority, these longstanding international practices \nshow the Second Circuit’s binding deference standard \nto be an outlier.  \n\nIII.  Analogous  Deference  Doctrines  Counsel \n“Binding” \nAgainst \nApplication \nDeference  to  Foreign  Sovereign  Legal \nStatements.  \n\nof \n\nto \n\nThe Second Circuit’s rigid rule of binding deference \ncannot  be  squared  with  the  more  flexible  deference \nstandards \nlegal \nthat  courts  have  applied \ninterpretations offered by federal and state agencies, \nand even state courts. Unlike foreign sovereigns, the \nExecutive Branch and organs of state governments are \nentitled  to  respect  not  just  as  a  matter  of  comity—\ninstead, the deference they are owed derives from the \nConstitution’s allocation of powers between and among \nfederal  and  state  governments.  However  important \n“the spirit of cooperation in which a domestic tribunal \napproaches the resolution of cases touching the laws \nand interests of other sovereign states” may be, Société \nNationale,  482  U.S.  at  543  n.27,  that  spirit  cannot \njustify  privileging  the  representations  of  foreign \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f48 \n\ngovernments over the official representations of U.S. \nfederal and state governments.   \n\nA.  Principles  of  Chevron  Deference  Do  Not \nSupport a Rule of Binding Deference. \n\nSome  courts  have  attempted  to  analogize  to \ndeference principles deriving from Chevron U.S.A., Inc. \nv. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), in \narticulating the standard of deference due to foreign \ngovernment legal interpretations. E.g., Access Telecom, \n197 F.3d at 714; In re Oil Spill, 954 F.2d 1279, 1312 \n(7th  Cir.  1992).  But  the  Chevron  doctrine  cannot  be \nsensibly  applied  to  foreign  government  statements \noffered  under  Rule  44.1  and,  in  any  event,  firmly-\nestablished  Chevron  principles  would  preclude  the \napplication  of  “binding”  deference  to  the  Ministry’s \nstatement in this case.  \n\n1.  Chevron  requires  courts  to  defer  to  an \nadministrative agency’s reasonable interpretation of an \nambiguous  statute  that  Congress  has  charged  the \nagency  with  administering.  467  U.S.  at  843-44  (“[A] \ncourt  may  not  substitute  its  own  construction  of  a \nstatutory  provision  for  a  reasonable  interpretation \nmade  by  the  administrator  of  an  agency.”).  The  rule \ngives  effect  to  Congress’s  decision  to  allocate \ninterpretive  authority  to  federal  agencies.  Encino \nMotorcars,  LLC  v.  Navarro,  136  S.  Ct.  2117,  2125 \n(2016).  Deference  is  not  required  because  agencies \nhave superior expertise in statutory interpretation, but \nbecause  courts  respect  Congress’s  constitutional \nauthority to decide that “[s]tatutory ambiguities will be \nresolved,  within \nreasonable \ninterpretation,  not  by  the  courts  but  by  the \nadministrative agency.” City of Arlington, Tex. v. FCC, \n\nthe  bounds \n\nof \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f49 \n\n569  U.S.  290,  296  (2013).  As  such,  “for  Chevron \ndeference  to  apply,  the  agency  must  have  received \ncongressional  authority  to  determine  the  particular \nmatter at issue in the particular manner adopted.” Id. \nat 306 (citing United States v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. \n218 (2001)).  \n\nis \n\nrole \n\nlaw-making \n\nThe deference that the Judicial Branch owes to its \ncoordinate  branches  of  government  under  the \nConstitution is different, in both degree and kind, than \nthe  respect  that  U.S.  courts  must  show  to  foreign \nsovereigns. The judiciary’s obligation to refrain from \nusurping  Congress’s \na \nconstitutional command that derives from the powers \nallocated  under  Articles  I  and  III,  as  well  as  the \nSupremacy  Clause  of  Article  VI.  By  contrast,  the \nrespect  owed  to  foreign  sovereigns  derives  from \ndiscretionary  principles  of  international  comity.  See \nHilton, 159 U.S. at 163-64. In the context of a foreign \nsovereign’s  legal  statement,  Congress  has  made  no \ndelegation to the sovereign that could plausibly require \nan Article III court to refrain from exercising its duty \nto  answer  a  question  of  law.  Chevron  thus  fails  to \nprovide a useful guide for evaluating foreign sovereign \nlegal statements. \n\n2. Even on its own terms, Chevron counsels against \nlegal \na  rule  of  “binding”  deference  to  foreign \nsubmissions. Chevron has several distinct steps, all of \nwhich the Second Circuit’s standard would discard in \nfavor of a standard that is far more deferential than \nthe respect that is owed to U.S. agencies. \n\na.  Deference  cannot  even  be  considered  under \nChevron  unless  it  is  first  established  that “Congress \ndelegated authority to the agency generally to make \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f50 \n\nrules  carrying  the  force  of  law,  and  that  the  agency \ninterpretation claiming deference was promulgated in \nthe exercise of that authority.” Mead, 533 U.S. at 226. \nIf  that  requirement  has  been  satisfied,  a  reviewing \ncourt must then engage in a statutory interpretation \nexercise to determine whether the relevant statute is \n“silent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,” \nand  if  so,  whether  the  agency’s  interpretation  is  a \n“permissible construction of the statute.” Chevron, 467 \nU.S. at 843. The reviewing court—which remains the \n“final authority on issues of statutory construction”—\nmust  first  employ  “traditional  tools  of  statutory \nconstruction”  to  determine  whether  the  statute  is \nambiguous on the “precise question at issue,” and that \nCongress has thereby implicitly delegated interpretive \nauthority to the agency. Id. at 843 n.9. This step of the \nChevron inquiry is often outcome-determinative. See, \ne.g., Kingdom Tech., Inc. v. United States, 136 S. Ct. \n1969, 1979 (2016). \n\nthat  a \n\nChevron’s threshold inquiries do not fit within the \nSecond  Circuit’s  standard.  Though  the  Court  of \nAppeals  allowed \nforeign  government’s \nevidentiary  “proffer”  must  be  “reasonable  under  the \ncircumstances presented,” Pet. App. 25a, it held that if \n“deference  by  any  measure  is  to  mean  anything,  it \nmust mean that a U.S. court not embark on a challenge \nto a foreign government’s official representation to the \ncourt regarding its laws or regulations.” Id. at 25a-26a. \nThe  inability  to  “challenge”  a  foreign  government’s \nconstruction of a foreign statute is incompatible with a \ncourt’s  duty  under  Chevron,  and  would  leave  courts \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f51 \n\nwith  far  less  discretion  than  they  possess  when \nreviewing  the  legal  interpretations  of  the  U.S. \nExecutive Branch.16 \n\nThe Second Circuit compounded its error by holding \nthat the mere fact of a foreign sovereign’s appearance \n(as amicus) automatically triggers a stronger form of \ndeference. Pet. App. 30a n.10. That holding cannot be \nsquared  with  the  principle  that  deference \nis \nappropriate  only  when  “the  agency  interpretation \nclaiming deference was promulgated in the exercise of \n. . .  authority,”  granted  by  Congress,  “to  make  rules \ncarrying the force of law.” Mead, 533 U.S. at 226-27. \nUnder Mead, the fact that an agency shows up in court \ndoes  not  mean  its  interpretation  is  worthy  of \ndeference—the  relevant  question  is  whether  the \nagency’s submission relies upon legally-binding rules \nthat  the  agency  was  authorized  to  issue.  See \nChristensen v. Harris Cnty., 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) \n(holding that interpretations promulgated in “opinion \nletters  . . .  policy  statements,  agency  manuals,  and \nenforcement guidelines” are instead “entitled to respect \n. . . , but only to the extent that those interpretations \nhave  the  ‘power  to  persuade.’”  (quoting  Skidmore  v. \nSwift & Co., 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)). The question \n\n16 For example, this Court has explained that “the meaning \nattributed  to  treaty  provisions  by  [executive]  agencies  charged \nwith  their  negotiation  and  enforcement  is  entitled  to  great \nweight,”  but  is  “not  conclusive.”  Sumimoto  Shoji  Am.,  Inc.  v. \nAvagliano, 457 U.S. 176, 184-85 (1982). The Second Circuit’s rule \nwould accordingly grant foreign agencies more deference than the \nU.S. Department of State receives on the same question of treaty-\ninterpretation. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f52 \n\nwhether  an  agency  has  appeared  (as  a  party  or  an \namicus) is irrelevant to whether the agency’s proposed \nlegal interpretation carries the “force of law.”17 \n\nb. Beyond Chevron’s threshold inquiries, there are \nmany  scenarios  under  which  the  Second  Circuit’s \nstandard  would  require  deference  when  Chevron’s \nframework  would  refuse  it.  For  example,  Chevron \npermits  courts  to  consider  “the  consistency  of  an \nagency’s position [as] a factor in assessing the weight \nthat  position  is  due,”  Good  Samaritan  Hosp.  v. \nShalala,  508  U.S.  402,  417  (1993),  and  “[a]n  agency \ninterpretation of a relevant provision which conflicts \nwith the agency’s earlier interpretation is entitled to \nconsiderably  less  deference  than  a  consistently  held \nagency view,” INS v. Cardoza-Fonseca, 480 U.S. 421, \n\n17 Even under a framework relying upon Auer deference, see \nAuer  v.  Robbins,  519  U.S.  452  (1997),  the  Second  Circuit’s \n“binding deference” standard is inappropriate. Auer deference is \n“undoubtedly inappropriate, for example, when [1] the agency’s \ninterpretation  is  plainly  erroneous  or  [2]  inconsistent  with  the \nregulation” being interpreted, “[3] when there is reason to suspect \nthat the agency’s interpretation does not reflect the agency’s fair \nand considered judgment on the matter in question,” as when “[4] \nthe agency’s interpretation conflicts with a prior interpretation, or \n[5] when it appears that the interpretation is nothing more than a \nconvenient  litigating  position,  or  [6]  a  post  hoc  rationalization \nadvanced  by  an  agency  seeking  to  defend  past  agency  action \nagainst attack.” Christopher v. SmithKline Beecham Corp., 567 \nU.S.  142,  155  (2012)  (citations  and  internal  quotation  marks \nomitted). The “binding deference” standard would forbid the kind \nof  inquiry  that  any  court  must  perform  under  Auer,  and  the \ninquiry that this Court described in Christopher is precisely the \nkind of inquiry in which the District Court engaged. Supra, at 16-\n19. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f53 \n\n446 n.30 (1987). Though an agency may shift positions, \nit  must  “cogently  explain  why  it  has  exercised  its \ndiscretion  in  a  given  manner,”  as  with  any  other \nagency  decision,  and  “the  basis  articulated  by  the \nagency  itself,”  not  “appellate  counsel’s  post  hoc \nrationalizations,” must satisfy the court, Motor Vehicle \nMfrs. Ass’n of U.S., Inc. v. State Farm Mut. Auto. Ins. \nCo., 463 U.S. 29, 48, 50 (1983). By contrast, the Second \nCircuit’s standard would foreclose the examination of a \nsovereign’s  prior  statements  when  those  statements \nappear outside the four corners of the sovereign’s brief. \nSee Pet. App. 28a-30a & n.9 (holding that the District \nCourt abused its discretion by examining and weighing \nevidence  of  prior  Ministry  statements  and  policies \nevincing  voluntariness,  as  well  as  contradictory \nstatements such as China’s statement to the WTO that \nit “gave up export administration of . . . vitamin C” as \nof January 1, 2002, Pet. App. 74a).  \n\nFurther, this Court’s Chevron cases have held that \n“[d]eference to what appears to be nothing more than \nan  agency’s  convenient  litigating  position”  would  be \n“entirely  inappropriate.”  Bowen  v.  Georgetown  Univ. \nHosp., 488 U.S. 204, 213 (1988). As the Bowen Court \nexplained:  \n\nWe  have  never  applied  [Chevron  deference]  to \nagency  litigating  positions  that  are  wholly \nunsupported \nor \nadministrative  practice.  .  .  .  ‘Congress  has \ndelegated to the administrative official and not \nto  appellate  counsel  the  responsibility  for \nelaborating and enforcing statutory commands.’  \n\nregulations, rulings, \n\nby \n\nId. at 212 (quoting Investment Co. Inst. v. Camp, 401 \nU.S. 617, 628 (1971)). Yet the Second Circuit held that \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f54 \n\nthe District Court abused its discretion in holding that \nthe Ministry’s interpretation of Chinese law amounted \nto a “carefully crafted and phrased litigating position.” \nPet. App. 120a.  \n\n3.  To  the  extent  that  this  Court’s  Chevron  cases \ninform the question presented, the relevance is limited \nto cases where this Court has considered how to weigh \nmaterials to which there is no legal obligation to defer. \nIn such circumstances, this Court has recognized the \nvalue  in  “[t]he  well-reasoned  views  of  the  agencies \nimplementing a statute,” which “‘constitute a body of \nexperience and informed judgment to which courts and \nlitigants may properly resort for guidance.’” Mead, 533 \nU.S. 227 (quoting Bragdon v. Abbott, 524 U.S. 624, 642 \n(1998)).  \n\nThis Court has highlighted certain guideposts for \nreviewing  courts:  absent  an  obligation  to  defer,  the \nweight  given  to  an  agency  construction  of  law  “will \nits \ndepend  upon  the  thoroughness  evident \nconsideration,  the  validity  of  its  reasoning,  its \nconsistency  with  earlier  and  later  pronouncements, \nand all those factors which give it power to persuade, if \nlacking power to control.” Skidmore, 323 U.S. at 140. \nEven  before  Skidmore,  courts  adopted  similar \nreasoning  in  the  context  of  determining  foreign  law. \nE.g.,  Petrogradsky  Mejdunarodny  Kommerchesky \nBank, 170 N.E. at 483-84 (Cardozo, C.J.).  \n\nin \n\nPetitioners  agree  with  the  United  States  that \namong the factors articulated above, other factors that \ngive a foreign government’s statement the “power to \npersuade” \n“clarity, \nthoroughness,  and  support;  its  context  and  purpose; \nthe authority of the entity making it; its consistency \n\nstatement’s \n\ninclude \n\nthe \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f55 \n\nwith past statements; and any other corroborating or \ncontradictory  evidence.”  Br.  of  the  United  States  as \nAmicus Curiae, at 8.18 That is precisely the inquiry in \nwhich  the  District  Court  engaged  in  this  case.  Pet. \nApp. 119a-122a. \n\nB.  The  Level  of  Deference  Granted  to  State \nEntities  Counsels  Against  Binding \nDeference to Foreign Governments.  \n\nA  standard  of  “binding  deference”  also  finds  no \nsupport in the tradition of federal-court deference to \narms of state governments, and would result in foreign \ngovernmental  entities  receiving  more  deferential \ntreatment  than  a  sovereign  state.  The  Constitution \nrequires  the  opposite  balance.  Bank  of  Augusta,  38 \nU.S. (13 Pet.) at 590; see Bond v. Hume, 243 U.S. 15, 22 \n(1917)  (“It  is  certain”  that  the  principles  of  comity \n“which  govern  as  between  countries foreign to  each \nother  apply  with  greater  force  to  the  relation  of \nthe several states to each other . . . and exact a greater \ndegree of respect for each other than otherwise by the \nprinciples of comity would be expected.”). \n\nstates \n\ncourts \n\nFederal \n\nstate \nowe \ninstrumentalities  significant  respect,  as  “courts  of  a \ncommon country,” Minneapolis & St. Louis R.R. Co. v. \nBombolis,  241  U.S.  211,  222  (1916),  whose  mutual \nfederal  government  are \nrelationships  with  the \ngoverned  by  the  Constitution  and  federal  law.  See \n\nand \n\n18 The United States has endorsed this sensible approach for \nat least the past fifteen years. See Br. for the United States in \nOpposition at 17-18, McNab v. United States, Nos. 03-622 & 03-\n627 (Dec. 29, 2003). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f56 \n\nClaflin  v.  Houseman,  93  U.S.  130,  136-37  (1876). \nDespite  the  respect  that  sovereign  states  are  owed, \nincluding the principle that states are the final arbiters \nof their own law, this Court has long held that only the \nhighest court in a given state is entitled to conclusive \ndeference  to  the  interpretation  of  that  state’s  own \nlaws—by  contrast,  the  decisions  of \nlower  and \nintermediate state courts receive only “some weight” \nand are not “controlling” in federal court. See Comm’r \nof Internal Revenue v. Estate of Bosch, 387 U.S. 456, \n465  (1967);  King  v.  Order  of  United  Commercial \nTravelers  of  Am.,  333  U.S.  153,  160-61  (1948).  By \nanalogy to that practice, courts have long held that the \ndecisions of foreign intermediate courts should not be \ntaken  as  authoritative  statements  of  foreign  law  in \nU.S. court. Yone Suzuki v. Cent. Argentine Ry., 27 F.2d \n795, 800 (2d Cir. 1928) (holding that the court was not \nbound  by  an  Argentinian  intermediate  appellate \ncourt’s interpretation of Argentinian maritime law). \n\nSimilarly, federal courts have long held that state \nadministrative  agencies  are  entitled  to  “substantial \ndeference”  when  interpreting  their  own  regulations, \nbut not “binding deference” that would preclude any \nchallenge to a state’s proffered interpretation. E.g. City \nof Bangor v. Citizens Commc’ns Co., 532 F.3d 70, 94 \n(1st  Cir.  2008)  (noting  that  federal  courts  “generally \ndefer  to  a  state  agency’s  interpretation  of  those \nstatutes  it  is  charged  with  enforcing”);  Pharm. \nResearch & Mfrs. of Am. v. Meadows, 304 F.3d 1197, \n1207-08  (11th  Cir.  2002)  (granting  “substantial \ndeference”  to  a  state  agency’s  interpretation  of  state \nlaw).  Even  under  such  a  standard,  agency \ninterpretations  that  fail  to  offer  a  “reasoned  and \nconsistent  view”  of  the  agency’s  regulations  are  not \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f57 \n\nentitled  to  deference,  and  “no  deference”  need  be \ngranted  “to  an  interpretation  put  forth  merely  as  a \nlitigation position.” Idaho Dep’t of Health & Welfare v. \nU.S.  Dep’t  of  Energy,  959  F.2d  149,  152-53  (9th  Cir. \n1992).  \n\nWhen  a  state’s  attorney  general  files  an  amicus \nbrief asserting a particular interpretation of state law, \nthis  Court  has  maintained  that  a  federal  court  need \nnot defer to that interpretation. See Clay v. Sun Ins. \nOffice  Ltd.,  363  U.S.  207,  212  (1960)  (the  Court  of \nAppeals appropriately concluded that “it could not, on \nthe available materials, make a confident guess how \nthe Florida Supreme Court would construe the statute” \ndespite the Florida Attorney General’s participation as \namicus  asserting  an  interpretation,  see    id.  at  216 \n(Black, J., dissenting)); Louisiana Power & Light Co. v. \nCity of Thibodaux, 360 U.S. 25, 30 (1959) (the District \nCourt  did  not  abuse  its  “fair  and  well-considered \njudicial  discretion”  when,  “[c]aught  between  the \nlanguage of an old but uninterpreted statute and the \npronouncement of the Attorney General of Louisiana,” \nit declined to adopt the Attorney General’s view). There \nis no justification for granting greater deference to the \nrepresentative of a foreign trade ministry than is owed \nto the highest law enforcement officials of a state, yet \nthat is precisely the result of the decision below. \n\nIV.  The Second Circuit’s Judgment Should Be \n\nReversed. \n\nAt every stage of this litigation, the District Court \nevaluated  the  Ministry’s  legal  claims  in  light  of  the \ndeveloping record, and determined that Chinese law \ndid  not  compel  all  of  Respondents’  anticompetitive \nconduct.  Pet.  App.  118a-155a,  168a-186a.  That \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f58 \n\ndetermination was correct. This Court should reverse \nthe panel’s subsequent resuscitation of Respondents’ \ncomity defense.19 \n\nBased solely on the standard of “binding deference” \nthat  it  imposed,  the  Court  of  Appeals  reversed  the \nDistrict  Court’s  otherwise  “entirely  appropriate” \nanalysis of Chinese law that governed the case to final \njudgment.  Pet.  App.  30a  n.10.  Then,  finding  for  the \nfirst time in the litigation that a “true conflict” between \nChinese and U.S. law had existed, the panel devoted \nfive  paragraphs  to  applying  a  ten-factor  “comity \nbalancing  test,”  after  which  it  vacated  the  District \nCourt’s judgment and the jury’s verdict, and reversed \nthe District Court’s order denying Respondents’ motion \nto dismiss. Pet. App. 33a-38a. As the Second Circuit \n\n19 The breadth of the Court of Appeals’ error is evident in its \nindefensible  decision  to  order  the  dismissal  of  Petitioners’ \ncomplaint,  with  prejudice,  without  any  explanation  of  how  the \ncomity doctrine barred adjudication of Petitioners’ distinct claims \nfor  liability  under  the  Sherman  Act.  Petitioners’  advanced  two \nclaims,  each  of  which  was  undisputed:  that  Respondents  (1) \nunlawfully  fixed  export  prices,  including  above  the  verification \nand chop price of $3.35; and (2) unlawfully colluded on output and \nexport volume. Pet. App. 56a. To warrant dismissal, Respondents \nwere required to show that Chinese law compelled them to engage \nin both categories of unlawful conduct. Pet. App. 126a (explaining \nthat “even if Chinese law did involve some compulsion, summary \njudgment would still be denied because Chinese law assuredly did \nnot compel all of defendant’s illegal conduct”). The panel did not \nexplain  how  Chinese  law  compelled  output  restrictions,  or \nRespondents’ numerous agreements to fix prices at specific levels \nabove  the  supposed  minimum  price  of  $3.35.  This  same  error \ninfected  the  panel’s  finding  regarding  Petitioners’  request  for \ninjunctive relief. Pet. App. 36a-37a. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f59 \n\nacknowledged, that disposition was compelled entirely \nby its conclusion that the District Court had applied \nthe  incorrect  standard  of  deference,  which  was \ndispositive of the panel’s analysis of Chinese law and \nits  “true  conflict”  analysis  in  general.  Pet.  App.  30a \nn.10, 27a.  \n\nStripped of its erroneous holding that the Ministry’s \nappearance  mandated  conclusive  deference,  all  that \nremains of the panel’s conclusion is its concession that \nthe  District  Court’s  analysis  of  Chinese  law  was \n“entirely appropriate.” Pet. App. 30a n.10. Accordingly, \nshould this Court agree that the Second Circuit should \nnot have applied “binding deference,” there could be no \nplausible  basis  for  comity-based  abstention  from \njurisdiction  over  petitioners’  antitrust  claims.  See \n(comity-based \nHartford  Fire,  509  U.S.  at  798 \nabstention, if ever appropriate, is inappropriate absent \na “true conflict” between foreign and U.S. law); In re \nIcenhower,  757  F.3d  1044,  1051-52  (9th  Cir.  2014) \n(same); Gross v. German Found. Indus. Initiative, 456 \nF.3d  363,  393  (3d  Cir.  2006)  (same);  see  also  Société \nNationale, 482 U.S. at 555 (Blackmun, J., concurring in \npart and dissenting in part) (“whether there is in fact a \ntrue conflict between domestic and foreign law” is “the \nthreshold question in a comity analysis”); U.S. Dep’t of \nJustice & Fed. Trade Comm’n, Antitrust Guidelines for \nInternational Enforcement and Cooperation, § 4.2.2 at \n32  (2017).  This  Court  should  reverse  the  Second \nCircuit’s judgment as to Respondents’ comity defense, \nand remand for further proceedings as to Respondents’ \nremaining defenses. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f60 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe judgment of the Court of Appeals should be \n\nreversed. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nMICHAEL J.
