        "INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \n\nThe Chamber of Commerce of the United States of \nAmerica  (Chamber)  is  the  world’s  largest  business \nfederation.  It represents 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than three \nmillion  companies  and  professional  organizations  of \nevery  size,  in  every  industry,  from  every  region  of  \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto  represent  the  interests  of  its  members  in  matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nThe  Chamber  regularly  files  amicus  curiae  briefs  in \ncases raising issues of concern to the nation’s business \ncommunity, including with respect to its international \nactivities. \n\nThe Chamber’s members and the broader business \ncommunity have a substantial interest in the level of \njudicial  deference  U.S.  courts  give  to  a  sovereign’s \ninterpretation  of  its  law  –  whether  that  sovereign  is \ndomestic or foreign. The Chamber has repeatedly urged \nthis  Court  to  reconsider,  or  at  least  substantially \ncabin, Seminole Rock2 (or Auer)3 deference granted to \na  federal  agency’s  interpretation  of  its  own  regula-\ntions.  See,  e.g.,  Garco  Construction,  Inc.  v.  Sec’y  of  \nthe  Army,  856  F.3d  938  (Fed.  Cir.  2017),  petition  for \ncert.  filed,  (U.S.  Aug.  7,  2017)  (No.  17-225).  And  the \nChamber, as either a plaintiff, petitioner or an amicus \n\n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or part, \nand no counsel or party made a monetary contribution to fund the \npreparation  or  submission  of  this  brief.    No  person  other  than \namicus  curiae,  its  members,  or  its  counsel  made  any  monetary \ncontribution to its preparation and submission.  The parties were \ngiven timely notice and have consented to this filing. \n\n2  See  Bowles  v.  Seminole  Rock  &  Sand  Corp.,  325  U.S.  410 \n\n(1945). \n\n3 See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997).",
        "2 \ncuriae, has frequently urged American courts to scruti-\nnize, rather than reflexively defer to, federal agencies’ \ncapacious  interpretations  of  purportedly  ambiguous \nstatutory  text.  See,  e.g.,  Util.  Air  Regulatory  Grp.  v. \nEPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427 (2014). \n\nThis  case,  which  presents  the  doctrine  of  interna-\ntional comity, is a species of the genus. Although the \nissue here, unlike in the Auer4 and Chevron5 contexts, \narises in an antitrust dispute between private parties \nand  concerns  a  particular  foreign  sovereign’s  inter-\npretation of its law, the Chamber is of the view that \nfree enterprise does not benefit from an uncritical and \nreflexive  deference  by  the  courts  to  a  sovereign \nregulator’s interpretation of its own laws.  \n\nThis  may  be  particularly  so  where  a  foreign  state \ndoes not operate with regulatory impartiality regard-\ning  state-owned  enterprises  and  private  actors,  and \nregularly  provides  “informal”  or  “non-binding”  man-\ndates  that  can  influence  the  behavior  of  state-owned \nand state-favored private enterprises, to the detriment \nof U.S. business. This Court should be circumspect lest \ndeference  to  a  foreign  country's  litigating  positions \nregarding the scope of its laws become carte blanche to \njustify violations of U.S. law, for example by creating \na  price  cartel  in  pursuit  of  an  industrial  policy \nobjective. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThis Court has long held that the doctrine of inter-\nnational comity requires a balancing of “international \nduty  and  convenience”  with  “the  rights  of  its  own \n\n4 See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997). \n\n5 See Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Nat’l Res. Def. Council, 467 U.S. \n\n837 (1984).",
        "3 \ncitizens  or  of  other  persons  who  are  under  the \nprotections of its laws.”  Hilton v. Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, \n163-64  (1895).    In  seeking  affirmance  of  the  Second \nCircuit’s  decision  below,  Respondents  propose  a \nstandard  of  deference  to  foreign  states  that  would \ndistort,  if  not  eliminate,  this  balancing  test.    They \nfavor a “clear rule of conclusive deference” whenever a \nforeign  sovereign  “formally”  appears  with  an  inter-\npretation  of  its  domestic  law  that  is  not  “obviously \nunreasonable.”6  While the views of a foreign state are \nentitled  to  substantial  deference,  affirmance  of  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  test  would  significantly  distort  the \ntraditional  weighing  of  interests  under  the  doctrine  \nof  comity.    The  purpose  of  this  amicus  curiae  brief  \nis to note the potential ramifications of Respondents’ \nreconception of the doctrine of comity on other areas of \nU.S. law. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  The  Doctrine  of  International  Comity  in \n\nU.S. Law \n\nInternational comity is a multifarious concept.7  The \nterm has been deployed by courts and commentators \nto  reference  both  the  deference  afforded  to  foreign \nsovereigns and the doctrine for determining the level \n\n6 Brief in Opposition at 20, 24. \n\n7  See  generally  Donald  E.  Childress  III,  Comity  as  Conflict: \nResituating  International  Comity  as  Conflict  of  Laws,  44  U.C. \nDAVIS L. REV. 11, 47-53 (2010) (describing three primary forms of \nmodern  U.S.  comity  analyses);  William  S.  Dodge,  International \nComity  in  American  Law,  115  COLUM.  L.  REV.  2071,  2078-79 \n(2015) (surveying U.S. legal applications of comity and proposing \na similar tripartite interpretative taxonomy).",
        "4 \nof  such  deference.8    This  submission  concerns  inter-\nnational comity in its second sense. \n\nThe doctrine of comity exists as a tool for U.S. judges \nto mediate the legal issues that arise when a particu-\nlar case implicates the sovereign interests of a foreign \nstate.  The concept of comity traces to conflict-of-laws \njurisprudence of the late Middle Ages.9  Seventeenth-\ncentury  Dutch  academic  Ulrich  Huber  later  opined \nthat  comity  calls  on  a  state  to  recognize  and  enforce \nrights  created  by  other  states,  provided  that  such \nrecognition does not prejudice the state or its subjects.10  \n\n8 Joel R. Paul, The Transformation of International Comity, 71 \nL.  &  CONTEMP.  PROBS.  19,  27  (2008)  (“[C]omity  is  offered  [in \nHilton  v.  Guyot]  both  as  a  rule  for  the  enforcement  of  foreign \njudgments,  and  as  an  explanation  for  why  foreign  judgments \nshould be enforced.  In other words, comity is both a legal doctrine \nand  also  a  justification  for  deferring  to  foreign  judgments.”); \nDonald  E.  Childress  III,  Comity  as  Conflict:  Resituating \nInternational Comity as Conflict of Laws, 44 U.C. DAVIS L. REV. \n11, 13-14 (2010) (“[a] court may apply the laws of another country \nby virtue of comity” but comity also “serves as a judicial canon” \nand  “jurisprudential  concept”).    See  also  Societe  Nationale \nIndustrielle Aerospatiale v. U.S. Dist. Court of S.  Dist. of Iowa, \n482 U.S. 522, 555 (1987); In re Maxwell Commc’n Corp., 93 F.3d \n1036, 1046 (2d Cir. 1996). \n\n9 Ernest G. Lorenzen, Huber’s De Conflictu Legum, 13 ILL. L. \nREV. 375, 391-92 (1919) (describing the recognition and enforce-\nment  of  foreign  court  decisions  “as  a  natural  duty  imposed  by \nconsiderations of justice” in accordance with the Roman maxim \nres judicata pro veritate accipitur). \n\n10  ULRICH  HUBER,  DE  JURE  CIVITATIS,  bk.  3,  s.  4,  c.  1,  n.  42 \n(1694)  (“Both  should  be  enforced,  on  grounds  of  comity,  for \nreasons of utility and convenience, unless it would cause preju-\ndice to the state or to its citizens.”).  See also Ernest G. Lorenzen, \nHuber’s De Conflictu Legum, 13 ILL. L. REV. 375, 378 (1919).  As \nearly  as  1797,  this  Court  acknowledged  the  doctrine  of  comity \namong  nations  by  explicit  reference  to  Huber’s  treatise.  See",
        "5 \nRelying on Huber, Justice Story wrote in his seminal \nmonograph Commentaries on the Conflict of Laws that \n“there would be extreme difficulty in saying, that other \nnations  were  bound  to  enforce  laws,  institutions,  or \ncustoms, of that nation, which were subversive of their \nown morals, justice, or polity.”11  \n\nIn the United States, the doctrine of comity affects  \na  host  of  judicial  doctrines,  from  foreign  sovereign \nimmunity12 and judicial abstention13 to the presump-\ntion  against  extraterritoriality14  and  approaches  to \n\nEmory  v.

Per \nHilton v.

        "7 \nproperly account for the novel, sensitive, and difficult \nissues that often arise in cases involving transnational \nlitigation. \n\nThis  Court  has  applied  Hilton’s  balancing  exercise \nfor over a century to cases involving foreign legislative, \nexecutive,  or  judicial  authorities.18    This  is  seen  in \nUnited  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S.  203  (1942),  which \nRespondents  cite  in  support  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \ndecision.    Brief  in  Opp.  at  24.    In  Pink,  this  Court \ndelineated  two  questions:    (i)  whether  the  Russian \ndecree  at  issue  was  intended  by  its  drafters  to  have \nextraterritorial  effect  and  (ii)  whether  the  decree \nshould be granted extraterritorial effect as a matter of \nU.S.  law.19    Although  the  Pink  Court  accepted  the \nrepresentations  of  the  Soviet  Government  regarding \nthe first inquiry, it exercised independent judgment in \nweighing the relevant interests at issue in respect of \nthe  second,  including  in  particular  the  views  of  the \nExecutive Branch.  The Court found that the Russian \n\n18 Disconto Gesellschaft v.

        "8 \ndecree was a facet of a larger “transaction[] resulting \nin an international compact between the two govern-\nments,”  which  established  diplomatic  relations  and \nsettled liability claims between U.S. and Soviet nationals.  \nPink, 315 U.S. at 223.  The Court concluded that the \ndecree should be granted extraterritorial effect because \n“[i]t  was  the  judgment  of  the  [U.S.]  political  depart-\nment  that  full  recognition  of  the  Soviet  government \nrequired settlement of all outstanding problems includ-\ning the claims of our nationals,” and “[w]e would usurp \nthe executive function if we held that that decision was \nnot final and conclusive in the courts.”  Id. at 230.  The \nPink  Court  thus  assessed  all  relevant  circumstances \nbefore  recognizing  the  extraterritorial  effect  of  the \nRussian decree.  Contrary to Respondents’ assertion, \nthe  Soviet  Government’s  interpretation  of  its  decree \nwas  an  element,  but  not  conclusive,  of  the  question \npresented in Pink. \n\nII. Respondents’  Proposed  Test  Would  Mate-\nrially  Alter  the  Doctrine  of  International \nComity \n\nThe Second Circuit’s decision cites Hilton v. Guyot \nbut then applies that decision in a way that effectively \nreduces  its  balancing  test  to  a  vanishing  point.    Pet. \nApp.  13a.    In  pressing  for  affirmance  in  this  Court, \nRespondents  propose  a  test  under  which  a  foreign \nstate’s interpretation of its own law is given “conclu-\nsive”  deference.    Ascribing  such  weight  to  a  single \nconsideration is irreconcilable with the holistic balanc-\ning  found  in  this  Court’s  jurisprudence.  It is settled \nlaw that a U.S. court should give substantial weight to \nthe statement of a foreign government concerning its",
        "9 \nown  law.20    But,  as  the  United  States  argued  at  the \ncertiorari stage, this should not preclude a U.S. court \nfrom considering “all relevant circumstances,” includ-\ning the “statement’s clarity, thoroughness, and support; \nits  context  and  purpose;  the  authority  of  the  entity \nmaking  it;  its  consistency  with  past  statements;  and \nany  other  corroborating  and  contradictory  evidence.”  \nInvitation  Brief  for  the  United  States  as  Amicus \nCuriae at 7-8. \n\nRespondents argue that their position “allows courts \nto  more  capably  and  credibly  balance  the  competing \nsovereign  interests  at  stake.”    Brief  in  Opp.  at  24.   \nBut  under  Respondents’  “clear  rule  of  conclusive \ndeference,”  the  foreign  state’s  position  would  have  a \nmultiplier  effect  on  the  remainder  of  the  comity \nanalysis,  which,  when  coupled  with  the  substantial \ndeference  already  afforded  foreign  sovereigns,  could \nbring  the  traditional  balancing  under  the  doctrine  of \ncomity into disequilibrium. \n\nThis would be a clear departure from the articula-\ntion  of  comity  in  Hilton  and  its  progeny,  and  would \nmaterially  restrict  the  scope  of  substantive  review  \nthat U.S. courts typically exercise when applying the \ndoctrine of comity. \n\nAs elaborated in Part III infra, it is not uncommon \nfor a foreign state to have a direct or indirect interest \nin  the  outcome  of  U.S.  litigation.    In  such  cases,  the \n\n20 See, e.g., Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. U.S. \nDist. Ct. of S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 543 n.27 (1987) (evoking \n“the spirit of cooperation in which a domestic tribunal approaches \nthe resolution of cases touching the laws and interests of other \nsovereign states.”); United States v. McNab, 324 F.3d 1266, 1241 \n(11th Cir. 2003) (noting that “[a]mong the most logical sources for \n[a]  court  to  look  to  in  its  determination  of  foreign  law  are  the \n[relevant] foreign officials”).",
        "10 \npost  litem  motam  statement  of  the  foreign  sovereign \nshould  be  measured  against  “any”  other  “relevant \nmaterial  or  source,”  as  provided  in  Federal  Rule  of \nCivil  Procedure  44.1.    There  is  no  inconsistency \nbetween affording deference to a foreign sovereign and \nconsidering  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  –  a \nrepresentation by a foreign state does not render other \nmaterials and sources immaterial.21 \n\nIn  particular,  Respondents’  proposed  test  would  \ngive  undue  weight  to  the  method  by  which  a  foreign \nsovereign  expresses  its  views,  with  states  receiving \nspecial, or even dispositive, deference when they “formally \nappear” in a pending U.S. case.  Brief in Opp. at 24.  \nAlthough a foreign state’s “direct participation” signals \nthe importance of that case to that state, the form of \nthe  state’s  participation  should  not  negate  full  con-\nsideration  of  all  relevant  factors.    The  views  of  a \nforeign  state  should  always  be  taken  into  account,  \nbut  the  particular  means  by  which  those  views  are \nexpressed  should  not  alter  the  substantive  balancing \nof the array of considerations bearing upon a particu-\nlar  transnational  dispute.

According  to  the  World  Justice \nProject’s 2017 Rule of Law Index, 75 of 113 countries score below \n0.60 (on a 1.00 scale) in terms of their provision of “civil justice,” \nwith 42 of those countries scoring below 0.50.

        "11 \nskew the application of the doctrine of comity in future \ncases, because the number of “formal representations” \nby foreign states would only increase if they received \n“conclusive deference.”  This could give foreign sover-\neigns undue influence over adversarial proceedings in \nwhich they have an interest. \n\nIII. U.S.  Courts  Have  Applied  the  Comity \nBalancing Test in a Diverse Array of Cases \nInvolving Foreign Law \n\nAlthough  presented  in  the  specific  context  of \nwhether  there  is  a  “true  conflict”  between  U.S.  and \nforeign law on competition, the case at hand presents \nthe broader question of whether U.S. courts under the \ndoctrine  of  international  comity  must  afford  “conclu-\nsive deference whenever a foreign sovereign formally \nappears with an interpretation of its own domestic law \nthat  is  not  obviously  unreasonable.”22  Respondents’ \nproposed  test  would,  if  accepted,  threaten  to  upend \nother  areas  of  U.S.  law  where  the  doctrine  of  comity \nobtains.    As  the  cases  below  illustrate,  the  holistic \nbalancing found in these other areas of U.S. law would \nbe materially altered under Respondents’ reconception \nof the doctrine of comity. \n\nA.  Cases  Involving  Questions  of  Foreign \n\nSovereign Immunity \n\nThe  doctrine  of  comity  is  manifested  in  U.S.  juris-\nprudence  on  the  liability  of  foreign  states  under  the \nexceptions  enumerated  in  the  Foreign  Sovereign \nImmunities Act (FSIA).  See 28 U.S.C. § 1605 et seq. \n\nUnder the FSIA, U.S. courts may exercise jurisdic-\ntion  over  foreign  sovereigns  and  their  agencies  and \n\n22 Brief in Opposition at 24.",
        "12 \ninstrumentalities  with  respect  to  certain  commercial \nactivity.  28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2).  In determining whether \na  foreign  entity  should  be  considered  a  state  instru-\nmentality, U.S. courts consider – but do not conclusively \ndefer to – foreign laws bearing upon its legal status.  \n\nFirst  Nat’l  City  Bank  v.  Banco  Para  el  Comercio \nExterior de Cuba (Bancec) concerned a letter of credit \nthat Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba (Bancec), \na Cuban bank, received in 1960 from Citibank, a U.S. \nbanking and financial services company. 462 U.S. 611, \n614  (1983).23    Days  after  Bancec  sought  to  collect  on \nthis  letter,  all  of  Citibank’s  assets  were  seized  and \nnationalized  without  compensation  by  the  Cuban \nGovernment.  Id.  When Bancec sought to enforce the \nletter of credit in U.S. district court, Citibank counter-\nclaimed  to  obtain  a  set  off  reflecting  the  value  of  its \nnationalized assets, for which it had not received any \ncompensation.  Id. at 614-15.  This counterclaim was \npredicated on the assertion that Bancec was the alter \nego of the Cuban Government, and was thus liable to \nprovide  compensation  for  the  expropriation.    Id.  at \n617-19. \n\nAs the Bancec Court acknowledged, “the law of the \nstate  of  incorporation  normally  determines  issues \nrelating  to  the  internal  affairs  of  a  corporation.”  462 \nU.S. at 621.  Bancec was established under Cuban law \nas “an official autonomous credit institution for foreign \ntrade with full juridical capacity of its own.” Id. at 613 \n(quoting Law No. 793, Art. 1 (1960) (Cuba)).  During \nthe  district  court  proceedings,  a  former  Cuban \ngovernment  attorney  confirmed  that  “under  Cuban \n\n23 At the time of the expropriation, Citibank was named First \n\nNational City Bank.  See Bancec, 426 U.S. at 613.",
        "13 \nlaw Bancec had independent legal status.”  Id. at 616, \nfn. 3. \n\nThe Bancec Court nevertheless declined to defer to \nCuban law.  As Bancec had effectively been subsumed \nby the Cuban Ministry of Trade, any award in Bancec’s \nfavor  would  accrue  to  the  Cuban  Government.    462 \nU.S.  at  615-16,  630-32.    Applying  Cuban  law  would \nthus  have  allowed  “the  real  beneficiary  of  such  an \naction,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba,  to \nobtain  relief  in  our  courts  that  it  could  not  obtain  in  \nits own right without waiving its sovereign immunity \nand answering for the seizure of Citibank’s assets.”  Id. \nat 632.  The Court observed that “giv[ing] conclusive \neffect to the law of the chartering state in determining \nwhether  the  separate  juridical  status  of  its  instru-\nmentality  should  be  respected  would  permit  th[at] \nstate  to  violate  with  impunity  the  rights  of  third \nparties under international law while effectively insu-\nlating itself from liability in foreign courts.”  Id. at 622. \n\nThe Bancec Court underlined that its decision was \nthe result of its balancing of competing equities which \n“announce[d] no mechanical formula for determining \nthe circumstances under which the normally separate \njuridical status of a government instrumentality is to \nbe disregarded.”  462 U.S. at 633.  Instead, it was “the \nproduct of the application of internationally recognized \nequitable principles to avoid the injustice that would \nresult  from  permitting  a  foreign  state  to  reap  the \nbenefits of our courts while avoiding the obligations of \ninternational law.”  Id. at 633-34. \n\nIf applied in the FSIA context, Respondents’ position \nmight  establish  the  very  “mechanical  formula”  that \nBancec  rejects,  which  could  allow  foreign  States  to \n“insulat[e]  [themselves]  from  liability  in  foreign \ncourts.”  Bancec, 462 U.S. at 622.",
        "14 \n\nB.  Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards \n\nUnder the New York Convention \n\nThe doctrine of international comity looms large in \nthe jurisprudence of U.S. courts on whether to enforce \nforeign arbitral awards that have been set aside at the \nseat of arbitration by foreign courts applying their own \ndomestic law. \n\nThe  enforcement  of  foreign  arbitral  awards  is  gov-\nerned  by  the  Convention  on  the  Recognition  and \nEnforcement  of  Foreign  Arbitral  Awards,  June 10, \n1958,  330  U.N.T.S.  38  (New  York  Convention).    The \nNew  York  Convention  is  implemented  in  the  United \nStates by Chapter Two of the Federal Arbitration Act.  \n9  U.S.C.  §§  201-08.    Article  III  of  the  New  York \nConvention sets out the conditions under which U.S. \ncourts  are  to  “recognize  arbitral  awards  as  binding  \nand  enforce  them.”    New  York  Convention,  Art.  III, \n9 U.S.C.  §  207.    In  particular,  courts  may  refuse \nrecognition  and  enforcement  where  the  award  “has \nbeen set aside or suspended by a competent authority \nof the country in which, or under the law of which, that \naward was made.”  New York Convention, Art. V(1)(e).   \n\nThe  New  York  Convention  does  not  mandate  \nthat the court in which enforcement is sought defer to \nthe  decision  of  the  court  where  the  arbitration  was \nseated; this is left to the discretion of the enforcement \ncourt.    See,  e.g.,  Karaha  Bodas  Corp.  v.  Perusahaan \nPertambangan  Minyak  Dan  Gas  Bumi  Negara,  335 \nF.3d  357,  369  (5th  Cir.  2003)  (“As  an  enforcement \njurisdiction,  our  courts  have  discretion  under  the \nConvention  to  enforce  an  award  despite  annulment  \nin another country, and have exercised that discretion \nin the past.”).  In exercising this discretion, U.S. courts \n“weigh[] notions of ‘public policy’ in determining whether \nto credit the judgment of a court in the primary State",

This entails balancing the deference owed \nto  the  foreign  judgment  setting  aside  the  arbitral \naward and the interests of the party seeking enforce-\nment  of  the  arbitral  award.    Ackermann  v.  Levine \n(Ackermann),  788  F.2d  830,  842  (2d  Cir.  1986) \n(balancing  (1)  the  res  judicata  of  a  foreign  judgment \nand (2) concerns about fairness to litigants). \n\nConsistent  with  the  substantial  deference  afforded \nforeign  sovereigns,  arbitral  awards  set  aside  at  the \nseat  of  arbitration  are  presumptively  unenforceable.  \nSee TermoRio, 487 F.3d 928, 936 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“an \narbitration award does not exist to be enforced in other \nContracting States if it has been lawfully ‘set aside’ by \na competent authority in the State in which the award \nwas made”).  This presumption recently led the Second \nCircuit  to  revoke  a  decision  enforcing  an  arbitral \naward after it was subsequently set aside by a court at \nthe  seat  of  arbitration.    Thai-Lao  Lignite  (Thailand) \nCorp.,  Ltd.  v.  Gov’t  of  the  Lao  People’s  Democratic \nRepublic, 864 F.3d 172, 182–89 (2d Cir. 2017). \n\nIn exceptional circumstances, however, U.S. courts \nwill enforce an award that was set aside at the seat of \narbitration,  where  deference  to  the  foreign  court’s \ndecision would be “repugnant to fundamental notions \nof what is decent and just.”  Corporacion Mexicana De \nMantenimiento Integral, S. De R.L. De C.V. v. Pemex-\nExploracion  Y  Produccion  (Pemex),  832  F.3d  92,  106 \n(2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Ackermann, 788 F.2d 830, 837 \n(2d  Cir.  1986)  and  Tahan  v.

Cir.  1981));  see  also  Matter  of  Arbitration \nBetween Chromalloy Aeroservices, a Div. of Chromalloy \nGas Turbine Corp. & Arab Republic of Egypt, 939 F. \nSupp. 907 (D.D.C. 1996).",
        "16 \nEach case is assessed on its specific facts.  In Pemex, \nfor instance, the Eleventh Collegiate Court in Mexico \nset aside an arbitral award against an instrumentality \nof  the  Mexican  Government  on  the  ground  that  the \ninstrumentality  could  not  be  compelled  to  arbitrate.  \nIn so holding, the Mexican court cited a Mexican law \nthat had been enacted after the arbitration had com-\nmenced.  832 F.3d 92, 99 (2d Cir. 2016). \n\nThe Second Circuit refused to defer to the Mexican \nannulment.  First, the Second Circuit held that defer-\nring  to  the  Mexican  annulment  of  an  arbitral  would \ngive  effect  to  a  “twelfth-hour  invocation  of  sovereign \nimmunity” that “shatters [the petitioner’s] investment-\nbacked expectation in contracting, thereby impairing \none of the core aims of contract law.”  Pemex, 832 F.3d. \nat 108.  Second, the Court opined that “[g]iving effect \nto the nullification would likewise impair the closely-\nrelated  concept  of  avoiding  retroactive  application  of \nlaws.”  Id.  Third, the Court held that “[t]he imperative \nof  having  cases  heard  –  somewhere  –  is  firmly \nembedded  in  legal  doctrine,”  and  recognizing  the \nannulment  would  leave  Petitioners  without  a  “sure \nforum in which to bring its contract claims.”  Id. at 109.  \nFourth,  recognizing  the  annulment  would  give  effect \nto “a taking of private property without compensation,” \nwhich  “would  be  an  unconstitutional  taking”  in  the \nUnited States.  Id. at 110. \n\nRespondents’ proposal for a “clear rule” in favor of a \nforeign  sovereign’s  interpretation  of  its  own  law  is \ndifficult to reconcile with the discretion the New York \nConvention  affords  enforcement  courts  to  recognize \narbitral awards that have been set aside at the seat of \narbitration.",

Enforcement  of  Foreign  Judgments  in \n\nU.S. Courts \n\nThe  doctrine  of  international  comity  is  integrated \ninto  the  jurisprudence  of  U.S.  courts  regarding  the \nenforcement of foreign judgments.  Generally, “a final \njudgment  of  a  court  of  a  foreign  state  .  .  .  is  entitled  \nto  recognition  in  courts  in  the  United  States.”  \nRESTATEMENT  (THIRD)  OF  FOREIGN  RELATIONS  LAW \n§ 481(1)  (1987).    However,  in  the  absence  of  specific \ntreaty  commitments,  “[n]o  sovereign  is  bound  .  .  .  to \nexecute within his dominions a judgment rendered by \nthe tribunals of another State.”  Hilton v. Guyot, 159 \nU.S. at 116.  A decision to recognize a foreign judgment \nnecessarily  involves  a  balancing  exercise,  as  it \n“depend[s] on a variety of circumstances which cannot \nbe  reduced  to  any  certain  rule.”    Id.  at  164  (quoting \nSTORY,  COMMENTARIES  ON  THE  CONFLICT  OF  LAWS  at \n§ 28). \n\nCourts  in  the  United  States  have  declined  to \nrecognize  foreign  judgments  in  instances  where  the \nproceedings  failed  to  provide  basic  due  process  or \notherwise  violated  public  policy.24    For  example,  in \n\n24 See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW \n§ 482 (1987) (setting out grounds for non-enforcement of foreign \njudgments);  Hilton  v.

Donziger, 974 F. Supp. \n2d  362,  608-09  (S.D.N.Y.  2014)  (denying  enforcement  where \njudgment  was  procured  through  fraud  and  corruption);  Manez \nLopez v. Ford Motor Corp., 470 F. Supp. 2d 917 (S.D. Ind. 2006)",
        "18 \nSanchez  Osorio  v.  Dole  Food  Corp.,  665  F.  Supp.  2d \n1307  (S.D.  Fla.  2009;  aff’d  sub  nom  Osorio  v.  Dow \nChemical  Corp.,  635  F.3d  1277  (11th  Cir.  2011)) \n(Osorio),  the  district  court  declined  to  enforce  a \njudgment by a Nicaraguan trial court against several \nagricultural  and  chemical  companies  pursuant  to \nlaw  specially \nSpecial  Law  364,  a  Nicaraguan \nregulating  the  procedures  for  lawsuits  pertaining  to \ncompensation of persons injured by the pesticide DBCP.  \nId. at 1311-12.  This judgment was part of a series of \ncases  brought  under  Special  Law  364,  which \ncollectively resulted in judgments of over US$2 billion.  \n665 F. Supp. 2d. at 1312. \n\nThe district court determined that Special Law 364 \npresented a number of concerns.  Among other things, \nit established an irrefutable presumption that DBCP \nwas  the  cause  of  plaintiffs’  sterility.    Osorio,  665  F. \nSupp. 2d at 1314 (citing Special Law 364, Art. 9), 1327 \n-29.    It  also  provided  the  parties  only  eight  days  to \nsubmit evidence, evincing in the district court’s view a \n“clear intent . . . to unfairly fast track these substantial \nand complex cases, and thereby deny DBCP defendants \nsufficient time to present an adequate defense.”  Id. at \n1340. \n\nIn particular, the district court was presented with \ndivergent  conclusions  from  the  Nicaraguan  Supreme \nCourt  and  the  Nicaraguan  trial  court  regarding  the \nconstitutionality  of  the  jurisdictional  provisions  in \nSpecial Law 364.  Osorio, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 1324-26.  \nThe district court noted that it “had broad discretion \n\n(refusing  recognition  of  foreign  judgment  procured  by  fraud); \nBank  Melli  Iran  v.  Pahlavi,  58  F.3d  1406  (9th  Cir.  1995) \n(generalized proof of systemic due process concerns sufficient to \nrefuse recognition of foreign judgment).",
        "19 \nto consider ‘any relevant material or source, including \ntestimony’  in  determining  foreign  law.”    Id.  at  1322, \n1326  (quoting  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1).    It  thereby \nexercised its independent judgment to conclude that, \nunder the Nicaraguan Supreme Court’s decision, there \nwas no jurisdiction over the judgment debtors.  Id. at \n1326. \n\nThe  district  court  also  denied  enforcement  of  the \nNicaraguan  trial  court’s  judgment  on  public  policy \ngrounds,  as  Special  Law  364  was  found  to  unfairly \ntarget “a narrowly defined group of foreign defendants \nand  subject  them  to  discriminatory  provisions  that \nd[id] not apply to domestic defendants[.]”  Osorio, 665 \nF.  Supp.  2d  at  1336.    The  court  found  that  this \noffended  the  general  principle  of  equality  before  the \nlaw that is “basic to any definition of due process and \nfair play.”  Id. at 1341-42.  In reaching its conclusions, \nthe  district  court  considered  the  totality  of  the \ncircumstances,  including  contradictory  interpreta-\ntions of Nicaraguan law.  Id. \n\nRespondents’  theory  of  conclusive  deference  to  a \nforeign  state’s  interpretation  of  its  own  laws  is  in \ntension  with  the  decisions  of  U.S.  courts  refusing  to \nrecognize  foreign  judgments  that  offend  minimal \nstandards of due process or violate public policy. \n\nD.  Discovery  Requests  Made  Under  28 \n\nU.S.C. § 1782 \n\nThe doctrine of comity also finds expression in the \ndiscretion accorded U.S. district courts to grant discov-\nery  requests  in  aid  of  a  foreign  or  international \ntribunal  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1782.    District  courts \nconsider  multiple  factors  when  deciding  whether  to \ngrant section 1782 discovery requests.",
        "20 \nThis  Court’s  judgment  in  Intel  Corp.  v.  Advanced \nMicro  Devices,  Inc.  represents  the  clearest  judicial \nstatement  on  how  district  courts  should  approach \nsection  1782  discovery  requests.    542  U.S.  241,  252 \n(2004).    It  establishes  a  discretionary  four-part  test \nunder  which  district  courts  consider  a  number  of \nfactors  bearing  upon  whether  to  grant  section  1782 \ndiscovery.25 \n\nOne  of  the  issues  presented  in  Intel  was  whether \nsection  1782  imposes  a  foreign-discoverability  rule, \nwhich  would  prevent  a  U.S.  court  from  ordering \nproduction of documents that the applicant could not \nobtain “if they were located in the foreign jurisdiction.”  \n542 U.S. at 259-60.  The Intel Court concluded that the \ndocuments  need  not  be  discoverable  in  the  foreign \njurisdiction, explaining that “[w]hile comity and parity \nconcerns  may  be  important  as  touchstones  for  a \ndistrict  court’s  exercise  of  discretion  in  particular \ncases, they do not permit our insertion of a generally \napplicable foreign-discoverability rule into the text of \n§ 1782(a).”  Id. at 260-61.   \n\nGiven  the  hortatory  aim  of  section  1782  of \n“encouraging foreign countries by example to provide \n\n25  Intel,  542  U.S.  at  264-65  (noting  that  a  district  court’s \ndiscretion  as  to  whether  to  grant  a  section  1782  application \nshould be guided by four factors: (1) whether the material sought \nis  within  the  foreign  tribunal’s  jurisdictional  reach  and  thus \naccessible absent section 1782 aid; (2) the nature of the foreign \ntribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and \nthe receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency \nabroad to U.S. federal-court jurisdictional assistance; (3) whether \nthe  section  1782  request  conceals  an  attempt  to  circumvent \nforeign  proof-gathering  limits  or  other  policies  of  a  foreign \ncountry or the United States; (4) whether the request is unduly \nintrusive or burdensome).",
        "21 \nsimilar  assistance  to  [U.S.]  courts,”26  the  Intel  Court \ndetermined that the receptivity of the foreign court to \nthe discovery provided by U.S. court could not dictate \nthe  inquiry.    In  particular  the  Court  did  not  give \nconclusive  weight  to  the  amicus  curiae  brief  of  the \nEuropean Commission, the putative beneficiary of the \nsection  1782  application  in  that  case,  which  opposed \nU.S.  discovery  on  the  ground  that  a  “private \ncomplainant lacks any authority to obtain discovery of \nbusiness  secrets  and  commercial  information”  under \nEuropean Union law.  542 U.S. at 272 (citing Brief for \nCommission of the European Communities as Amicus \nCuriae at 13, n. 15.). \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  understanding  that  comity \nrequires “conclusive” deference to the formal view of a \nforeign  sovereign  sits  uneasily  with  the  Intel  Court’s \ndetermination  that  the  non-discoverability  of  docu-\nments  as  a  matter  of  foreign  law  does  not  control  a \ndistrict court’s analysis as to whether discovery should \nbe allowed under section 1782. \n\n*    *    * \n\nThe  doctrine  of  international  comity  requires  sub-\nstantial  deference  to  the  interests  of  foreign  states \nalong with consideration of the interests of the United \nStates  and  those  seeking  the  protection  of  its  laws.  \nThe test applied by the Second Circuit below and advo-\ncated by Respondents in this Court threatens to upset \nthis balance, with potentially undesirable consequences \nfor other areas of U.S. law. \n\n26 Intel, 542 U.S. at 252.",

It represents 300,000 direct members and \nindirectly represents the interests of more than three \nmillion  companies  and  professional  organizations  of \nevery  size,  in  every  industry,  from  every  region  of  \nthe country.  An important function of the Chamber is \nto  represent  the  interests  of  its  members  in  matters \nbefore Congress, the Executive Branch, and the courts.  \nThe  Chamber  regularly  files  amicus  curiae  briefs  in \ncases raising issues of concern to the nation’s business \ncommunity, including with respect to its international \nactivities. \n\nThe Chamber’s members and the broader business \ncommunity have a substantial interest in the level of \njudicial  deference  U.S.  courts  give  to  a  sovereign’s \ninterpretation  of  its  law  –  whether  that  sovereign  is \ndomestic or foreign. The Chamber has repeatedly urged \nthis  Court  to  reconsider,  or  at  least  substantially \ncabin, Seminole Rock2 (or Auer)3 deference granted to \na  federal  agency’s  interpretation  of  its  own  regula-\ntions.  See,  e.g.,  Garco  Construction,  Inc.  v.  Sec’y  of  \nthe  Army,  856  F.3d  938  (Fed.  Cir.  2017),  petition  for \ncert.  filed,  (U.S.  Aug.  7,  2017)  (No.  17-225).  And  the \nChamber, as either a plaintiff, petitioner or an amicus \n\n1 No counsel for a party authored this brief in whole or part, \nand no counsel or party made a monetary contribution to fund the \npreparation  or  submission  of  this  brief.    No  person  other  than \namicus  curiae,  its  members,  or  its  counsel  made  any  monetary \ncontribution to its preparation and submission.  The parties were \ngiven timely notice and have consented to this filing. \n\n2  See  Bowles  v.  Seminole  Rock  &  Sand  Corp.,  325  U.S.  410 \n\n(1945). \n\n3 See Auer v. Robbins, 519 U.S. 452 (1997). \n\n                                            \n\f2 \ncuriae, has frequently urged American courts to scruti-\nnize, rather than reflexively defer to, federal agencies’ \ncapacious  interpretations  of  purportedly  ambiguous \nstatutory  text.  See,  e.g.,  Util.  Air  Regulatory  Grp.  v. \nEPA, 134 S. Ct. 2427 (2014). \n\nThis  case,  which  presents  the  doctrine  of  interna-\ntional comity, is a species of the genus. Although the \nissue here, unlike in the Auer4 and Chevron5 contexts, \narises in an antitrust dispute between private parties \nand  concerns  a  particular  foreign  sovereign’s  inter-\npretation of its law, the Chamber is of the view that \nfree enterprise does not benefit from an uncritical and \nreflexive  deference  by  the  courts  to  a  sovereign \nregulator’s interpretation of its own laws.  \n\nThis  may  be  particularly  so  where  a  foreign  state \ndoes not operate with regulatory impartiality regard-\ning  state-owned  enterprises  and  private  actors,  and \nregularly  provides  “informal”  or  “non-binding”  man-\ndates  that  can  influence  the  behavior  of  state-owned \nand state-favored private enterprises, to the detriment \nof U.S. business. This Court should be circumspect lest \ndeference  to  a  foreign  country's  litigating  positions \nregarding the scope of its laws become carte blanche to \njustify violations of U.S. law, for example by creating \na  price  cartel  in  pursuit  of  an  industrial  policy \nobjective. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThis Court has long held that the doctrine of inter-\nnational comity requires a balancing of “international \nduty  and  convenience”  with  “the  rights  of  its  own \n\n4 See Auer v.

Guyot, 159 U.S. 113, \n163-64  (1895).    In  seeking  affirmance  of  the  Second \nCircuit’s  decision  below,  Respondents  propose  a \nstandard  of  deference  to  foreign  states  that  would \ndistort,  if  not  eliminate,  this  balancing  test.    They \nfavor a “clear rule of conclusive deference” whenever a \nforeign  sovereign  “formally”  appears  with  an  inter-\npretation  of  its  domestic  law  that  is  not  “obviously \nunreasonable.”6  While the views of a foreign state are \nentitled  to  substantial  deference,  affirmance  of  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  test  would  significantly  distort  the \ntraditional  weighing  of  interests  under  the  doctrine  \nof  comity.    The  purpose  of  this  amicus  curiae  brief  \nis to note the potential ramifications of Respondents’ \nreconception of the doctrine of comity on other areas of \nU.S. law. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  The  Doctrine  of  International  Comity  in \n\nU.S. Law \n\nInternational comity is a multifarious concept.7  The \nterm has been deployed by courts and commentators \nto  reference  both  the  deference  afforded  to  foreign \nsovereigns and the doctrine for determining the level \n\n6 Brief in Opposition at 20, 24. \n\n7  See  generally  Donald  E.

The concept of comity traces to conflict-of-laws \njurisprudence of the late Middle Ages.9  Seventeenth-\ncentury  Dutch  academic  Ulrich  Huber  later  opined \nthat  comity  calls  on  a  state  to  recognize  and  enforce \nrights  created  by  other  states,  provided  that  such \nrecognition does not prejudice the state or its subjects.10  \n\n8 Joel R.

Guyot]  both  as  a  rule  for  the  enforcement  of  foreign \njudgments,  and  as  an  explanation  for  why  foreign  judgments \nshould be enforced.  In other words, comity is both a legal doctrine \nand  also  a  justification  for  deferring  to  foreign  judgments.”); \nDonald  E.

Per \nHilton v.

U.S. \nDist. Court of S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 543–44 (1987) (noting \nthat  the  “concept  of  international  comity”  requires  “par-\nticularized analysis” for discovery requests outside of the United \nStates for use in domestic courts); Intel Corp. v.

Pink,  315  U.S.  203  (1942),  which \nRespondents  cite  in  support  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \ndecision.    Brief  in  Opp.  at  24.    In  Pink,  this  Court \ndelineated  two  questions:    (i)  whether  the  Russian \ndecree  at  issue  was  intended  by  its  drafters  to  have \nextraterritorial  effect  and  (ii)  whether  the  decree \nshould be granted extraterritorial effect as a matter of \nU.S.  law.19    Although  the  Pink  Court  accepted  the \nrepresentations  of  the  Soviet  Government  regarding \nthe first inquiry, it exercised independent judgment in \nweighing the relevant interests at issue in respect of \nthe  second,  including  in  particular  the  views  of  the \nExecutive Branch.  The Court found that the Russian \n\n18 Disconto Gesellschaft v.

Miller, 268 U.S. 552, 561 \n(1925) (finding that “adoption of foreign law by comity” would be \n“much  beyond  its  limits  as  at  present  defined”  and  finding  “no \nbasis  for  the  contention  that  the  principle  of  comity  would \nrequire” the same); Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. \nU.S.  Dist.  Court  of  S.  Dist.  of  Iowa,  482  U.S.  522,  546  (1987) \n(requiring courts to “take care to demonstrate due respect for . . . \nany sovereign interest expressed by a foreign state” but declining \nto  “articulate  specific  rules  to  guide  this  delicate  task  of \nadjudication”). \n\n19  Pink,  315  U.S.  at  221  (1942)  (“We  hold  that  so  far  as  its \nintended  effect  is  concerned  the  Russian  decree  embraced  the \nNew  York  assets  of  the  First  Russian  Insurance  Co.  .  .  .    The \nquestion  of  whether  the  decree  should  be  given  extraterritorial \neffect is of course a distinct matter.”). \n\n                                            \n\f8 \ndecree was a facet of a larger “transaction[] resulting \nin an international compact between the two govern-\nments,”  which  established  diplomatic  relations  and \nsettled liability claims between U.S. and Soviet nationals.  \nPink, 315 U.S. at 223.  The Court concluded that the \ndecree should be granted extraterritorial effect because \n“[i]t  was  the  judgment  of  the  [U.S.]  political  depart-\nment  that  full  recognition  of  the  Soviet  government \nrequired settlement of all outstanding problems includ-\ning the claims of our nationals,” and “[w]e would usurp \nthe executive function if we held that that decision was \nnot final and conclusive in the courts.”  Id. at 230.  The \nPink  Court  thus  assessed  all  relevant  circumstances \nbefore  recognizing  the  extraterritorial  effect  of  the \nRussian decree.  Contrary to Respondents’ assertion, \nthe  Soviet  Government’s  interpretation  of  its  decree \nwas  an  element,  but  not  conclusive,  of  the  question \npresented in Pink. \n\nII. Respondents’  Proposed  Test  Would  Mate-\nrially  Alter  the  Doctrine  of  International \nComity \n\nThe Second Circuit’s decision cites Hilton v. Guyot \nbut then applies that decision in a way that effectively \nreduces  its  balancing  test  to  a  vanishing  point.    Pet. \nApp.  13a.    In  pressing  for  affirmance  in  this  Court, \nRespondents  propose  a  test  under  which  a  foreign \nstate’s interpretation of its own law is given “conclu-\nsive”  deference.    Ascribing  such  weight  to  a  single \nconsideration is irreconcilable with the holistic balanc-\ning  found  in  this  Court’s  jurisprudence.  It is settled \nlaw that a U.S. court should give substantial weight to \nthe statement of a foreign government concerning its \n\n\f9 \nown  law.20    But,  as  the  United  States  argued  at  the \ncertiorari stage, this should not preclude a U.S. court \nfrom considering “all relevant circumstances,” includ-\ning the “statement’s clarity, thoroughness, and support; \nits  context  and  purpose;  the  authority  of  the  entity \nmaking  it;  its  consistency  with  past  statements;  and \nany  other  corroborating  and  contradictory  evidence.”  \nInvitation  Brief  for  the  United  States  as  Amicus \nCuriae at 7-8. \n\nRespondents argue that their position “allows courts \nto  more  capably  and  credibly  balance  the  competing \nsovereign  interests  at  stake.”    Brief  in  Opp.  at  24.   \nBut  under  Respondents’  “clear  rule  of  conclusive \ndeference,”  the  foreign  state’s  position  would  have  a \nmultiplier  effect  on  the  remainder  of  the  comity \nanalysis,  which,  when  coupled  with  the  substantial \ndeference  already  afforded  foreign  sovereigns,  could \nbring  the  traditional  balancing  under  the  doctrine  of \ncomity into disequilibrium. \n\nThis would be a clear departure from the articula-\ntion  of  comity  in  Hilton  and  its  progeny,  and  would \nmaterially  restrict  the  scope  of  substantive  review  \nthat U.S. courts typically exercise when applying the \ndoctrine of comity. \n\nAs elaborated in Part III infra, it is not uncommon \nfor a foreign state to have a direct or indirect interest \nin  the  outcome  of  U.S.  litigation.    In  such  cases,  the \n\n20 See, e.g., Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. U.S. \nDist. Ct. of S. Dist. of Iowa, 482 U.S. 522, 543 n.27 (1987) (evoking \n“the spirit of cooperation in which a domestic tribunal approaches \nthe resolution of cases touching the laws and interests of other \nsovereign states.”); United States v. McNab, 324 F.3d 1266, 1241 \n(11th Cir. 2003) (noting that “[a]mong the most logical sources for \n[a]  court  to  look  to  in  its  determination  of  foreign  law  are  the \n[relevant] foreign officials”). \n\n                                            \n\f10 \npost  litem  motam  statement  of  the  foreign  sovereign \nshould  be  measured  against  “any”  other  “relevant \nmaterial  or  source,”  as  provided  in  Federal  Rule  of \nCivil  Procedure  44.1.    There  is  no  inconsistency \nbetween affording deference to a foreign sovereign and \nconsidering  the  totality  of  the  circumstances  –  a \nrepresentation by a foreign state does not render other \nmaterials and sources immaterial.21 \n\nIn  particular,  Respondents’  proposed  test  would  \ngive  undue  weight  to  the  method  by  which  a  foreign \nsovereign  expresses  its  views,  with  states  receiving \nspecial, or even dispositive, deference when they “formally \nappear” in a pending U.S. case.  Brief in Opp. at 24.  \nAlthough a foreign state’s “direct participation” signals \nthe importance of that case to that state, the form of \nthe  state’s  participation  should  not  negate  full  con-\nsideration  of  all  relevant  factors.    The  views  of  a \nforeign  state  should  always  be  taken  into  account,  \nbut  the  particular  means  by  which  those  views  are \nexpressed  should  not  alter  the  substantive  balancing \nof the array of considerations bearing upon a particu-\nlar  transnational  dispute.    Indeed,  such  a  rule  could \n\n21 The weight afforded a particular foreign state’s submission \nmight include consideration of the reliability of the application of \nthe rule of law in that jurisdiction.  For example, only 97 of 215 \ncountries  and  territories  enjoyed  a  positive  score  (on  a  scale  of \n-2.5 to 2.5) in the 2016 World Bank governance indicator for “rule \nof  law.”    See  WORLD  BANK  GROUP,  WORLDWIDE  GOVERNANCE \nINDICATORS:  1996-2016  (2018),  http://info.worldbank.org/govern \nance/wgi/index.aspx#home.    According  to  the  World  Justice \nProject’s 2017 Rule of Law Index, 75 of 113 countries score below \n0.60 (on a 1.00 scale) in terms of their provision of “civil justice,” \nwith 42 of those countries scoring below 0.50.  See WORLD JUSTICE \nPROJECT,  RULE  OF  LAW  INDEX:  2017-2018  (2018),  https://world \njusticeproject.org/sites/default/files/documents/WJP_ROLI_2017\n18_Online-Edition_0.pdf. \n\n                                            \n\f11 \nskew the application of the doctrine of comity in future \ncases, because the number of “formal representations” \nby foreign states would only increase if they received \n“conclusive deference.”  This could give foreign sover-\neigns undue influence over adversarial proceedings in \nwhich they have an interest. \n\nIII. U.S.  Courts  Have  Applied  the  Comity \nBalancing Test in a Diverse Array of Cases \nInvolving Foreign Law \n\nAlthough  presented  in  the  specific  context  of \nwhether  there  is  a  “true  conflict”  between  U.S.  and \nforeign law on competition, the case at hand presents \nthe broader question of whether U.S. courts under the \ndoctrine  of  international  comity  must  afford  “conclu-\nsive deference whenever a foreign sovereign formally \nappears with an interpretation of its own domestic law \nthat  is  not  obviously  unreasonable.”22  Respondents’ \nproposed  test  would,  if  accepted,  threaten  to  upend \nother  areas  of  U.S.  law  where  the  doctrine  of  comity \nobtains.    As  the  cases  below  illustrate,  the  holistic \nbalancing found in these other areas of U.S. law would \nbe materially altered under Respondents’ reconception \nof the doctrine of comity. \n\nA.  Cases  Involving  Questions  of  Foreign \n\nSovereign Immunity \n\nThe  doctrine  of  comity  is  manifested  in  U.S.  juris-\nprudence  on  the  liability  of  foreign  states  under  the \nexceptions  enumerated  in  the  Foreign  Sovereign \nImmunities Act (FSIA).  See 28 U.S.C. § 1605 et seq. \n\nUnder the FSIA, U.S. courts may exercise jurisdic-\ntion  over  foreign  sovereigns  and  their  agencies  and \n\n22 Brief in Opposition at 24. \n\n                                            \n\f12 \ninstrumentalities  with  respect  to  certain  commercial \nactivity.  28 U.S.C. § 1605(a)(2).  In determining whether \na  foreign  entity  should  be  considered  a  state  instru-\nmentality, U.S. courts consider – but do not conclusively \ndefer to – foreign laws bearing upon its legal status.  \n\nFirst  Nat’l  City  Bank  v.  Banco  Para  el  Comercio \nExterior de Cuba (Bancec) concerned a letter of credit \nthat Banco Para el Comercio Exterior de Cuba (Bancec), \na Cuban bank, received in 1960 from Citibank, a U.S. \nbanking and financial services company. 462 U.S. 611, \n614  (1983).23    Days  after  Bancec  sought  to  collect  on \nthis  letter,  all  of  Citibank’s  assets  were  seized  and \nnationalized  without  compensation  by  the  Cuban \nGovernment.  Id.  When Bancec sought to enforce the \nletter of credit in U.S. district court, Citibank counter-\nclaimed  to  obtain  a  set  off  reflecting  the  value  of  its \nnationalized assets, for which it had not received any \ncompensation.  Id. at 614-15.  This counterclaim was \npredicated on the assertion that Bancec was the alter \nego of the Cuban Government, and was thus liable to \nprovide  compensation  for  the  expropriation.    Id.  at \n617-19. \n\nAs the Bancec Court acknowledged, “the law of the \nstate  of  incorporation  normally  determines  issues \nrelating  to  the  internal  affairs  of  a  corporation.”  462 \nU.S. at 621.  Bancec was established under Cuban law \nas “an official autonomous credit institution for foreign \ntrade with full juridical capacity of its own.” Id. at 613 \n(quoting Law No. 793, Art. 1 (1960) (Cuba)).  During \nthe  district  court  proceedings,  a  former  Cuban \ngovernment  attorney  confirmed  that  “under  Cuban \n\n23 At the time of the expropriation, Citibank was named First \n\nNational City Bank.  See Bancec, 426 U.S. at 613. \n\n                                            \n\f13 \nlaw Bancec had independent legal status.”  Id. at 616, \nfn. 3. \n\nThe Bancec Court nevertheless declined to defer to \nCuban law.  As Bancec had effectively been subsumed \nby the Cuban Ministry of Trade, any award in Bancec’s \nfavor  would  accrue  to  the  Cuban  Government.    462 \nU.S.  at  615-16,  630-32.    Applying  Cuban  law  would \nthus  have  allowed  “the  real  beneficiary  of  such  an \naction,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Cuba,  to \nobtain  relief  in  our  courts  that  it  could  not  obtain  in  \nits own right without waiving its sovereign immunity \nand answering for the seizure of Citibank’s assets.”  Id. \nat 632.  The Court observed that “giv[ing] conclusive \neffect to the law of the chartering state in determining \nwhether  the  separate  juridical  status  of  its  instru-\nmentality  should  be  respected  would  permit  th[at] \nstate  to  violate  with  impunity  the  rights  of  third \nparties under international law while effectively insu-\nlating itself from liability in foreign courts.”  Id. at 622. \n\nThe Bancec Court underlined that its decision was \nthe result of its balancing of competing equities which \n“announce[d] no mechanical formula for determining \nthe circumstances under which the normally separate \njuridical status of a government instrumentality is to \nbe disregarded.”  462 U.S. at 633.  Instead, it was “the \nproduct of the application of internationally recognized \nequitable principles to avoid the injustice that would \nresult  from  permitting  a  foreign  state  to  reap  the \nbenefits of our courts while avoiding the obligations of \ninternational law.”  Id. at 633-34. \n\nIf applied in the FSIA context, Respondents’ position \nmight  establish  the  very  “mechanical  formula”  that \nBancec  rejects,  which  could  allow  foreign  States  to \n“insulat[e]  [themselves]  from  liability  in  foreign \ncourts.”  Bancec, 462 U.S. at 622. \n\n\f14 \n\nB.  Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards \n\nUnder the New York Convention \n\nThe doctrine of international comity looms large in \nthe jurisprudence of U.S. courts on whether to enforce \nforeign arbitral awards that have been set aside at the \nseat of arbitration by foreign courts applying their own \ndomestic law. \n\nThe  enforcement  of  foreign  arbitral  awards  is  gov-\nerned  by  the  Convention  on  the  Recognition  and \nEnforcement  of  Foreign  Arbitral  Awards,  June 10, \n1958,  330  U.N.T.S.  38  (New  York  Convention).    The \nNew  York  Convention  is  implemented  in  the  United \nStates by Chapter Two of the Federal Arbitration Act.  \n9  U.S.C.  §§  201-08.    Article  III  of  the  New  York \nConvention sets out the conditions under which U.S. \ncourts  are  to  “recognize  arbitral  awards  as  binding  \nand  enforce  them.”    New  York  Convention,  Art.  III, \n9 U.S.C.  §  207.    In  particular,  courts  may  refuse \nrecognition  and  enforcement  where  the  award  “has \nbeen set aside or suspended by a competent authority \nof the country in which, or under the law of which, that \naward was made.”  New York Convention, Art. V(1)(e).   \n\nThe  New  York  Convention  does  not  mandate  \nthat the court in which enforcement is sought defer to \nthe  decision  of  the  court  where  the  arbitration  was \nseated; this is left to the discretion of the enforcement \ncourt.    See,  e.g.,  Karaha  Bodas  Corp.  v.  Perusahaan \nPertambangan  Minyak  Dan  Gas  Bumi  Negara,  335 \nF.3d  357,  369  (5th  Cir.  2003)  (“As  an  enforcement \njurisdiction,  our  courts  have  discretion  under  the \nConvention  to  enforce  an  award  despite  annulment  \nin another country, and have exercised that discretion \nin the past.”).  In exercising this discretion, U.S. courts \n“weigh[] notions of ‘public policy’ in determining whether \nto credit the judgment of a court in the primary State \n\n\f15 \nvacating an arbitration award.” TermoRio S.A. E.S.P. \nv. Electranta S.P. (TermoRio), 487 F.3d 928, 938 (D.C. \nCir. 2007).  This entails balancing the deference owed \nto  the  foreign  judgment  setting  aside  the  arbitral \naward and the interests of the party seeking enforce-\nment  of  the  arbitral  award.    Ackermann  v.  Levine \n(Ackermann),  788  F.2d  830,  842  (2d  Cir.  1986) \n(balancing  (1)  the  res  judicata  of  a  foreign  judgment \nand (2) concerns about fairness to litigants). \n\nConsistent  with  the  substantial  deference  afforded \nforeign  sovereigns,  arbitral  awards  set  aside  at  the \nseat  of  arbitration  are  presumptively  unenforceable.  \nSee TermoRio, 487 F.3d 928, 936 (D.C. Cir. 2007) (“an \narbitration award does not exist to be enforced in other \nContracting States if it has been lawfully ‘set aside’ by \na competent authority in the State in which the award \nwas made”).  This presumption recently led the Second \nCircuit  to  revoke  a  decision  enforcing  an  arbitral \naward after it was subsequently set aside by a court at \nthe  seat  of  arbitration.    Thai-Lao  Lignite  (Thailand) \nCorp.,  Ltd.  v.  Gov’t  of  the  Lao  People’s  Democratic \nRepublic, 864 F.3d 172, 182–89 (2d Cir. 2017). \n\nIn exceptional circumstances, however, U.S. courts \nwill enforce an award that was set aside at the seat of \narbitration,  where  deference  to  the  foreign  court’s \ndecision would be “repugnant to fundamental notions \nof what is decent and just.”  Corporacion Mexicana De \nMantenimiento Integral, S. De R.L. De C.V. v. Pemex-\nExploracion  Y  Produccion  (Pemex),  832  F.3d  92,  106 \n(2d Cir. 2016) (quoting Ackermann, 788 F.2d 830, 837 \n(2d  Cir.  1986)  and  Tahan  v.  Hodgson,  662  F.2d  862, \n864  (D.C.  Cir.  1981));  see  also  Matter  of  Arbitration \nBetween Chromalloy Aeroservices, a Div. of Chromalloy \nGas Turbine Corp. & Arab Republic of Egypt, 939 F. \nSupp. 907 (D.D.C. 1996). \n\n\f16 \nEach case is assessed on its specific facts.  In Pemex, \nfor instance, the Eleventh Collegiate Court in Mexico \nset aside an arbitral award against an instrumentality \nof  the  Mexican  Government  on  the  ground  that  the \ninstrumentality  could  not  be  compelled  to  arbitrate.  \nIn so holding, the Mexican court cited a Mexican law \nthat had been enacted after the arbitration had com-\nmenced.  832 F.3d 92, 99 (2d Cir. 2016). \n\nThe Second Circuit refused to defer to the Mexican \nannulment.  First, the Second Circuit held that defer-\nring  to  the  Mexican  annulment  of  an  arbitral  would \ngive  effect  to  a  “twelfth-hour  invocation  of  sovereign \nimmunity” that “shatters [the petitioner’s] investment-\nbacked expectation in contracting, thereby impairing \none of the core aims of contract law.”  Pemex, 832 F.3d. \nat 108.  Second, the Court opined that “[g]iving effect \nto the nullification would likewise impair the closely-\nrelated  concept  of  avoiding  retroactive  application  of \nlaws.”  Id.  Third, the Court held that “[t]he imperative \nof  having  cases  heard  –  somewhere  –  is  firmly \nembedded  in  legal  doctrine,”  and  recognizing  the \nannulment  would  leave  Petitioners  without  a  “sure \nforum in which to bring its contract claims.”  Id. at 109.  \nFourth,  recognizing  the  annulment  would  give  effect \nto “a taking of private property without compensation,” \nwhich  “would  be  an  unconstitutional  taking”  in  the \nUnited States.  Id. at 110. \n\nRespondents’ proposal for a “clear rule” in favor of a \nforeign  sovereign’s  interpretation  of  its  own  law  is \ndifficult to reconcile with the discretion the New York \nConvention  affords  enforcement  courts  to  recognize \narbitral awards that have been set aside at the seat of \narbitration. \n\n \n\f17 \n\nC.  Enforcement  of  Foreign  Judgments  in \n\nU.S. Courts \n\nThe  doctrine  of  international  comity  is  integrated \ninto  the  jurisprudence  of  U.S.  courts  regarding  the \nenforcement of foreign judgments.  Generally, “a final \njudgment  of  a  court  of  a  foreign  state  .  .  .  is  entitled  \nto  recognition  in  courts  in  the  United  States.”  \nRESTATEMENT  (THIRD)  OF  FOREIGN  RELATIONS  LAW \n§ 481(1)  (1987).    However,  in  the  absence  of  specific \ntreaty  commitments,  “[n]o  sovereign  is  bound  .  .  .  to \nexecute within his dominions a judgment rendered by \nthe tribunals of another State.”  Hilton v. Guyot, 159 \nU.S. at 116.  A decision to recognize a foreign judgment \nnecessarily  involves  a  balancing  exercise,  as  it \n“depend[s] on a variety of circumstances which cannot \nbe  reduced  to  any  certain  rule.”    Id.  at  164  (quoting \nSTORY,  COMMENTARIES  ON  THE  CONFLICT  OF  LAWS  at \n§ 28). \n\nCourts  in  the  United  States  have  declined  to \nrecognize  foreign  judgments  in  instances  where  the \nproceedings  failed  to  provide  basic  due  process  or \notherwise  violated  public  policy.24    For  example,  in \n\n24 See, e.g., RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN RELATIONS LAW \n§ 482 (1987) (setting out grounds for non-enforcement of foreign \njudgments);  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.  S.  113,  167  (1895)  (“Every \nforeign judgment, of whatever nature, in order to be entitled to \nany effect, must have been rendered by a court having jurisdic-\ntion of the cause, and upon regular proceedings, and due notice.”); \nInt’l  Transactions,  Ltd.  v.  Embotelladora  Agral  Regiomontana, \nS.A.  de  CV,  347  F.3d  589,  594  (5th  Cir.  2003)  (“Notice  is  an \nelement of our notion of due process and the United States will \nnot  enforce  a  judgment  obtained  without  the  bare  minimum \nrequirements of notice.”); Chevron Corp. v. Donziger, 974 F. Supp. \n2d  362,  608-09  (S.D.N.Y.  2014)  (denying  enforcement  where \njudgment  was  procured  through  fraud  and  corruption);  Manez \nLopez v. Ford Motor Corp., 470 F. Supp. 2d 917 (S.D. Ind. 2006) \n\n                                            \n\f18 \nSanchez  Osorio  v.  Dole  Food  Corp.,  665  F.  Supp.  2d \n1307  (S.D.  Fla.  2009;  aff’d  sub  nom  Osorio  v.  Dow \nChemical  Corp.,  635  F.3d  1277  (11th  Cir.  2011)) \n(Osorio),  the  district  court  declined  to  enforce  a \njudgment by a Nicaraguan trial court against several \nagricultural  and  chemical  companies  pursuant  to \nlaw  specially \nSpecial  Law  364,  a  Nicaraguan \nregulating  the  procedures  for  lawsuits  pertaining  to \ncompensation of persons injured by the pesticide DBCP.  \nId. at 1311-12.  This judgment was part of a series of \ncases  brought  under  Special  Law  364,  which \ncollectively resulted in judgments of over US$2 billion.  \n665 F. Supp. 2d. at 1312. \n\nThe district court determined that Special Law 364 \npresented a number of concerns.  Among other things, \nit established an irrefutable presumption that DBCP \nwas  the  cause  of  plaintiffs’  sterility.    Osorio,  665  F. \nSupp. 2d at 1314 (citing Special Law 364, Art. 9), 1327 \n-29.    It  also  provided  the  parties  only  eight  days  to \nsubmit evidence, evincing in the district court’s view a \n“clear intent . . . to unfairly fast track these substantial \nand complex cases, and thereby deny DBCP defendants \nsufficient time to present an adequate defense.”  Id. at \n1340. \n\nIn particular, the district court was presented with \ndivergent  conclusions  from  the  Nicaraguan  Supreme \nCourt  and  the  Nicaraguan  trial  court  regarding  the \nconstitutionality  of  the  jurisdictional  provisions  in \nSpecial Law 364.  Osorio, 665 F. Supp. 2d at 1324-26.  \nThe district court noted that it “had broad discretion \n\n(refusing  recognition  of  foreign  judgment  procured  by  fraud); \nBank  Melli  Iran  v.  Pahlavi,  58  F.3d  1406  (9th  Cir.  1995) \n(generalized proof of systemic due process concerns sufficient to \nrefuse recognition of foreign judgment). \n\n                                            \n\f19 \nto consider ‘any relevant material or source, including \ntestimony’  in  determining  foreign  law.”    Id.  at  1322, \n1326  (quoting  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1).    It  thereby \nexercised its independent judgment to conclude that, \nunder the Nicaraguan Supreme Court’s decision, there \nwas no jurisdiction over the judgment debtors.  Id. at \n1326. \n\nThe  district  court  also  denied  enforcement  of  the \nNicaraguan  trial  court’s  judgment  on  public  policy \ngrounds,  as  Special  Law  364  was  found  to  unfairly \ntarget “a narrowly defined group of foreign defendants \nand  subject  them  to  discriminatory  provisions  that \nd[id] not apply to domestic defendants[.]”  Osorio, 665 \nF.  Supp.  2d  at  1336.    The  court  found  that  this \noffended  the  general  principle  of  equality  before  the \nlaw that is “basic to any definition of due process and \nfair play.”  Id. at 1341-42.  In reaching its conclusions, \nthe  district  court  considered  the  totality  of  the \ncircumstances,  including  contradictory  interpreta-\ntions of Nicaraguan law.  Id. \n\nRespondents’  theory  of  conclusive  deference  to  a \nforeign  state’s  interpretation  of  its  own  laws  is  in \ntension  with  the  decisions  of  U.S.  courts  refusing  to \nrecognize  foreign  judgments  that  offend  minimal \nstandards of due process or violate public policy. \n\nD.  Discovery  Requests  Made  Under  28 \n\nU.S.C. § 1782 \n\nThe doctrine of comity also finds expression in the \ndiscretion accorded U.S. district courts to grant discov-\nery  requests  in  aid  of  a  foreign  or  international \ntribunal  under  28  U.S.C.  §  1782.    District  courts \nconsider  multiple  factors  when  deciding  whether  to \ngrant section 1782 discovery requests. \n\n\f20 \nThis  Court’s  judgment  in  Intel  Corp.  v.  Advanced \nMicro  Devices,  Inc.  represents  the  clearest  judicial \nstatement  on  how  district  courts  should  approach \nsection  1782  discovery  requests.    542  U.S.  241,  252 \n(2004).    It  establishes  a  discretionary  four-part  test \nunder  which  district  courts  consider  a  number  of \nfactors  bearing  upon  whether  to  grant  section  1782 \ndiscovery.25 \n\nOne  of  the  issues  presented  in  Intel  was  whether \nsection  1782  imposes  a  foreign-discoverability  rule, \nwhich  would  prevent  a  U.S.  court  from  ordering \nproduction of documents that the applicant could not \nobtain “if they were located in the foreign jurisdiction.”  \n542 U.S. at 259-60.  The Intel Court concluded that the \ndocuments  need  not  be  discoverable  in  the  foreign \njurisdiction, explaining that “[w]hile comity and parity \nconcerns  may  be  important  as  touchstones  for  a \ndistrict  court’s  exercise  of  discretion  in  particular \ncases, they do not permit our insertion of a generally \napplicable foreign-discoverability rule into the text of \n§ 1782(a).”  Id. at 260-61.   \n\nGiven  the  hortatory  aim  of  section  1782  of \n“encouraging foreign countries by example to provide \n\n25  Intel,  542  U.S.  at  264-65  (noting  that  a  district  court’s \ndiscretion  as  to  whether  to  grant  a  section  1782  application \nshould be guided by four factors: (1) whether the material sought \nis  within  the  foreign  tribunal’s  jurisdictional  reach  and  thus \naccessible absent section 1782 aid; (2) the nature of the foreign \ntribunal, the character of the proceedings underway abroad, and \nthe receptivity of the foreign government or the court or agency \nabroad to U.S. federal-court jurisdictional assistance; (3) whether \nthe  section  1782  request  conceals  an  attempt  to  circumvent \nforeign  proof-gathering  limits  or  other  policies  of  a  foreign \ncountry or the United States; (4) whether the request is unduly \nintrusive or burdensome). \n\n                                            \n\f21 \nsimilar  assistance  to  [U.S.]  courts,”26  the  Intel  Court \ndetermined that the receptivity of the foreign court to \nthe discovery provided by U.S. court could not dictate \nthe  inquiry.    In  particular  the  Court  did  not  give \nconclusive  weight  to  the  amicus  curiae  brief  of  the \nEuropean Commission, the putative beneficiary of the \nsection  1782  application  in  that  case,  which  opposed \nU.S.  discovery  on  the  ground  that  a  “private \ncomplainant lacks any authority to obtain discovery of \nbusiness  secrets  and  commercial  information”  under \nEuropean Union law.  542 U.S. at 272 (citing Brief for \nCommission of the European Communities as Amicus \nCuriae at 13, n. 15.). \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  understanding  that  comity \nrequires “conclusive” deference to the formal view of a \nforeign  sovereign  sits  uneasily  with  the  Intel  Court’s \ndetermination  that  the  non-discoverability  of  docu-\nments  as  a  matter  of  foreign  law  does  not  control  a \ndistrict court’s analysis as to whether discovery should \nbe allowed under section 1782. \n\n*    *    * \n\nThe  doctrine  of  international  comity  requires  sub-\nstantial  deference  to  the  interests  of  foreign  states \nalong with consideration of the interests of the United \nStates  and  those  seeking  the  protection  of  its  laws.  \nThe test applied by the Second Circuit below and advo-\ncated by Respondents in this Court threatens to upset \nthis balance, with potentially undesirable consequences \nfor other areas of U.S. law. \n\n26 Intel, 542 U.S. at 252. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f22 \nCONCLUSION \n\nFor the foregoing reasons, the Chamber respectfully \nrequests that this Court reverse the judgment of the \nSecond Circuit below. \n\nSTEVEN P.
