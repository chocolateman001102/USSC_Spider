        "-2- \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  held  that  “when  a  foreign \ngovernment,  acting  through  counsel  or  otherwise, \ndirectly  participates  in  U.S.  court  proceedings  by \nproviding  a  sworn  evidentiary  proffer  regarding  the \nconstruction  and  effect  of  its  laws  and  regulations, \nwhich \nis  reasonable  under  the  circumstances \npresented,  a  U.S.  court  is  bound  to  defer  to  those \nstatements.”  In re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, \n837  F.3d  175,  189  (2d  Cir.  2016).  This  “bound-to-\ndefer” rule is incorrect and unwise. \n\nFirst, the “bound-to-defer” rule is inconsistent \nwith  basic  American  conflict-of-laws  principles \ngoverning  the  determination  of  foreign  law.  It  is \ninconsistent  with  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure \n44.1’s  broad  authorization \nfor  U.S.  courts  to \n“consider  any  relevant  material  or  source”  when \ndetermining  foreign  law.  It  is  inconsistent  with  the \nprinciple  that  determinations  of  foreign  law  should \nbe accurate. And it is inconsistent with the principle \nof  judicial  independence  in  the  determination  of \nforeign law. \n\nthe \n\nSecond, \n\n“bound-to-defer” \n\nis \ninconsistent with foreign and international practice. \nIn  most  other  countries,  information  about  foreign \nlaw  is  not  binding  on  courts.  Moreover,  the  world’s \ntwo  main  treaties  on  the  interpretation  of  foreign \nlaw  expressly  provide  that  information  supplied  by \n\nrule \n\npart, and no person other than amici or their counsel has made \nany monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-",

To  the  contrary,  as  the  Rules \nAdvisory  Committee  explained,  Rule  44.1  provides \nthat  “the  court  is  not  limited  by  material  presented \nby the parties; it may engage in its own research and \nconsider  any  relevant  material  thus  found.”  Fed.

For  example,  the  “bound-to-defer” \nrule  would  prevent  a  U.S.  court  from  considering \nforeign \njudicial \nthat  might  undermine  or  provide \ndecisions \nperspective  for  the  interpretation  proffered  by  a \nforeign  executive  agency.  Thus,  the  Second  Circuit’s \nrule  would  effectively  amend  Rule  44.1  by  creating \nan  exception  to  Rule  44.1’s  broad  authorization  in \ncases \nforeign  governments  provide \ninformation  about  foreign  law.

Rule  44.1, \nafter  all,  calls  for  courts  to  “consider”  relevant \nsources.

Pink,  315 \nU.S.  203  (1942).  This  reliance  is  misplaced.  Most \nimportantly,  for  the  reasons  just  given,  the  Second \nCircuit’s  reading  of  Pink  as  stating  a  “bound-to-\ndefer” rule is inconsistent with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure  44.1,  which  entered  into  effect  in  1966, \nmore than 20 years after Pink was decided. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-",

Indicia  of \nreliability  and  persuasiveness  would  only  matter  if \nthey so clearly tilted against a foreign government’s \nstatements as to render them not “reasonable under \nthe  circumstances.”  In re Vitamin C, 837  F.3d  at \n189.  The  principle  behind  the  determination  of \nforeign  law,  however,  is  to  arrive  at  an  accurate \ndetermination, not merely a reasonable one. \n\nThis flaw is especially serious at the appellate \nlevel. As the Second Circuit correctly observed, “[t]he \ndetermination  of  foreign  law  is  ‘a  question  of  law, \nwhich  is  subject  to  de novo  review.’”  Id.  at  183.  A \nprimary purpose of de novo review is to ensure that \nan  appellate  court  can  correct  a  district  court’s \ninaccurate  determination  of  the  content  or  meaning \nof  foreign  law.  See  McKesson  Corp.  v.  Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, 753 F.3d 239, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(undertaking  “de  novo  review  of  the  district  court’s \ninterpretation  of  foreign  law”)  (emphasis  added); \nIracheta v.

Yet  the  Second  Circuit’s  review \nwas  based  more  on  deference  than  accuracy.  As  the \nSecond  Circuit \nitself  states:  “[I]f  the  Chinese \nGovernment had not appeared in this litigation, the \ndistrict court’s careful and thorough treatment of the \nevidence  before  it  in  analyzing  what  Chinese  law \nrequired . . . would have been entirely appropriate.” \nIn re Vitamin C, 837 F.3d at 191 n.10. \n\nC. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S RULE \nVIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF \nJUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE \nDETERMINATION OF FOREIGN \nLAW. \n\nThe bedrock principle of judicial independence \napplies  to  all  determinations  of  law  by  U.S.  courts, \nincluding  determinations  of  foreign  law.

First,  it  would  impose  on  U.S.  courts  a \nparticular  interpretation  of  foreign  law—that  of  an \nappearing foreign government—rather than allowing \nU.S.  courts  to  determine  foreign  law  independently \nbased  on  indicia  of  reliability  and  persuasiveness \nsuch  as  those  discussed  above.  Second,  the  “bound-\nto-defer”  rule  would  render  meaningless \nthe \nauthority  Rule  44.1  gives  courts  to  do  independent \nresearch  on  foreign  law.  The  Second  Circuit’s \n“bound-to-defer”  rule  thus  would  be  just  the  sort  of \n“judge-made  doctrine  for  the  abdication  of  the \njudicial  duty”  to  interpret  law  that  has  raised \nconcerns in other contexts. See Gutierrez-Brizuela v. \nLynch,  834  F.3d  1142,  1152  (10th  Cir.  2016) \n(Gorsuch,  J.).  In  this  case,  the  bound-to-defer  rule \nwould  require  adopting  the  Chinese  ministry’s \nstatement  even  though  the  trial  court  found  that \n“the  plain  language  of  the  documentary  evidence \nsubmitted  by  plaintiffs  directly  contradicts  the \nMinistry’s  position.”  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust \nLitigation, 584 F.

Foreign  courts  are  not \nsubjected  to  the  “bound-to-defer”  rule  that  the \nSecond  Circuit  would  impose  on  U.S.  courts,  and \ntreaties  on  the  determination  of  foreign  law  show \nthat  foreign  governments  do  not  expect  that  sort  of \ndeference  from  each  other.  Indeed,  the  fundamental \nprinciples  of  accuracy  and  independence  in  the \ndetermination of foreign law that underpin Rule 44.1 \nare  widely  recognized  in  foreign  and  international \npractice. \n\nA. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S RULE IS \nINCONSISTENT WITH FOREIGN \nPRACTICE. \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  bound-to-defer  rule \nwould impose a more rigid rule of deference on U.S. \ncourts  than  foreign  countries  impose  on  their  own \ncourts.

This  “bound-to-\ndefer” rule is incorrect and unwise. \n\nFirst, the “bound-to-defer” rule is inconsistent \nwith  basic  American  conflict-of-laws  principles \ngoverning  the  determination  of  foreign  law.  It  is \ninconsistent  with  Federal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure \n44.1’s  broad  authorization \nfor  U.S.  courts  to \n“consider  any  relevant  material  or  source”  when \ndetermining  foreign  law.  It  is  inconsistent  with  the \nprinciple  that  determinations  of  foreign  law  should \nbe accurate. And it is inconsistent with the principle \nof  judicial  independence  in  the  determination  of \nforeign law. \n\nthe \n\nSecond, \n\n“bound-to-defer” \n\nis \ninconsistent with foreign and international practice. \nIn  most  other  countries,  information  about  foreign \nlaw  is  not  binding  on  courts.  Moreover,  the  world’s \ntwo  main  treaties  on  the  interpretation  of  foreign \nlaw  expressly  provide  that  information  supplied  by \n\nrule \n\npart, and no person other than amici or their counsel has made \nany monetary contribution intended to fund the preparation or \nsubmission of this brief. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                         \n\f-3- \n\nforeign  governments \nin  accordance  with  those \ntreaties is not binding on courts. Simply put, foreign \ngovernments  do  not  expect  each  other’s  courts  to  be \n“bound  to  defer”  to  each  other’s  interpretations  of \nforeign  law,  much  less  the  interpretation  of  one \nexecutive agency of a foreign government. \n\nof \n\nto \n\nlaw. \n\nforeign \n\ndelegate \n\ninappropriately \n\nThird,  there  are \n\nimportant  reasons  why \ndeference  principles  should  be  kept  separate  from \nthe principles governing the determination of foreign \nlaw.  The  Second  Circuit’s  “bound-to-defer”  rule \nwould \nforeign \ngovernments  power  to  influence  the  application  of \ndomestic  law—and  hence  the  implementation  of \ndomestic  policy—in  a  wide  range  of  cases  in  which \nthe  proper  application  of  U.S.  law  depends  on  the \nIn  addition, \ndetermination \ninternational  comity  does  not  require  U.S.  courts  to \ndefer to foreign governments in the determination of \nforeign  law.  International  comity  is  a  traditional \nrationale  for  choice-of-law  rules  that  require  the \napplication of foreign law as a rule of decision under \nspecified circumstances. But in this case, foreign law \nis  at  issue  because  the  application  of  U.S.  law \ndepends  on  the  interpretation  of  foreign  law,  not \nbecause choice-of-law rules require the application of \nforeign  law.  Therefore,  this  case  does  not  implicate \nthe \nrules. \nMoreover, \nthat  animate  comity \ndoctrines are not the same as those that animate the \nrules  governing  the  determination  of  foreign  law. \nThe  former  are  concerned  with  the  respect  owed \nlatter  are \nbetween  governments,  whereas  the \ncourts \nconcerned  with \nindependently and accurately determine the content \n\nrationale \nthe  concerns \n\nchoice-of-law \n\nthat  U.S. \n\nensuring \n\ncomity \n\nfor \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-4- \n\nof  foreign  law.  In  fact,  the  “bound-to-defer”  rule \nraises  issues  that  are  likely  to  pose  significant \ncomity  concerns  that  the  ordinary  Rule  44.1 \napproach avoids. U.S. courts can still address comity \nconcerns—separately \nindependent \nfrom \ndetermination of foreign law. \n\ntheir \n\nTo  be  sure,  U.S.  courts  should  give  respectful \nconsideration  to  a  foreign  government’s  statements \nabout  its  law.  But  as  a  matter  of  law,  a  foreign \ngovernment’s  statements  cannot  be  binding  on  U.S. \ncourts.  Instead,  U.S.  courts  should  accurately  and \nindependently determine the meaning of foreign law \ntaking \nforeign \ngovernment’s  own  statements,  but  also  other \nrelevant \nlaw.  This \nimportant \nindependent  approach \nwhen—as in this U.S. antitrust case and many other \ncases—the  proper  application  of  American  law \ndepends on a determination of foreign law. \n\ninto  account  not \n\ninformation  about \n\nis  especially \n\nonly \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\nI. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S “BOUND-TO-\nDEFER” RULE IS INCONSISTENT WITH \nBASIC AMERICAN CONFLICT-OF-LAWS \nPRINCIPLES. \n\nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  44.1 \nauthorizes  U.S.  courts  to  “consider  any  relevant \nmaterial  or  source”  when  determining  foreign  law. \nThe  Second  Circuit’s \nis \ninconsistent  with  this  broad  authorization.  The \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  also  is  inconsistent  with  the \nbasic  American  conflict-of-laws  principles  that  U.S. \ncourts  should  determine  foreign  law  accurately  and \nthat they should do so independently. \n\n“bound-to-defer”  rule \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-5- \n\nA. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S RULE IS \nINCONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL \nRULE OF CIVIL PROCEDURE 44.1. \n\nRule  44.1  authorizes  courts  to  “consider  any \nrelevant  material  or  source”  when  determining \nforeign  law.  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1.  Relevant  material \nmay  include  primary  sources  (such  as  constitutions, \nstatutes, regulations, and court decisions), secondary \nmaterials  (such  as  treatises  and  other  books,  legal \nperiodicals,  and  other  legal  commentary  on  foreign \nlaw),  and  expert  advice  (such  as  expert  opinions  of \njudges,  and  scholars).  See  WRIGHT  & \nlawyers, \nMILLER, FEDERAL PRACTICE AND PROCEDURE, 9A FED. \nPRAC. & PROC. CIV. § 2444 (3d ed.). \n\nintended—even  when  a \n\nThe text of Rule 44.1 places no limitations on \nthis  broad  authorization.  Moreover,  the  official \nadvisory notes to Rule 44.1 do not indicate that any \nforeign \nexception  was \ngovernment  is  one  of  the  sources  of  information \nabout  foreign  law.  To  the  contrary,  as  the  Rules \nAdvisory  Committee  explained,  Rule  44.1  provides \nthat  “the  court  is  not  limited  by  material  presented \nby the parties; it may engage in its own research and \nconsider  any  relevant  material  thus  found.”  Fed.  R. \nCiv.  P.  44.1,  Notes  of  Advisory  Committee  on \nRules—1966.  By  authorizing  U.S. courts to consider \nany  relevant  material  or  source,  Rule  44.1  helps \nensure that U.S. courts have the flexibility to obtain \nthe  information  they  need  to  determine  foreign  law \naccurately. See infra  Part  I.B;  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1, \nNotes of Advisory Committee on Rules—1966 (noting \nthat  “the  rule  provides  flexible  procedures  for \npresenting and utilizing material on issues of foreign \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-6- \n\nlaw  by  which  a  sound  result  can  be  achieved  with \nfairness to the parties”). \n\nto \n\nlaw \n\nforeign \n\naccording \n\ncourts.  By  making \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  “bound-to-defer”  rule \nwould  limit  the  authority  that  Rule  44.1  grants  to \nforeign  government \nthe \nstatements  binding,  the  Second  Circuit’s  rule  would \nnot  allow  U.S.  courts  to  “consider  any  relevant \nmaterial  or  source”  when  determining  foreign  law. \nInstead,  whenever  a  foreign  government  makes \nstatements about its law that are “reasonable under \nthe circumstances,” U.S. courts would be required to \nthose \ndetermine \nstatements—regardless  of  the  reliability  of  those \nstatements,  and  regardless  of  other  reliable  and \npersuasive information that might compel a different \ndetermination.  For  example,  the  “bound-to-defer” \nrule  would  prevent  a  U.S.  court  from  considering \nforeign \njudicial \nthat  might  undermine  or  provide \ndecisions \nperspective  for  the  interpretation  proffered  by  a \nforeign  executive  agency.  Thus,  the  Second  Circuit’s \nrule  would  effectively  amend  Rule  44.1  by  creating \nan  exception  to  Rule  44.1’s  broad  authorization  in \ncases \nforeign  governments  provide \ninformation  about  foreign  law.  Any  amendment  to \nRule  44.1  should  be  made  pursuant  to  the  federal \nrulemaking process. See 28 U.S.C. §§ 2072 et seq. \n\nlegislative  records  or \n\nin  which \n\nforeign \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  attempts  to  avoid  this \nconclusion  by  reasoning  that  “Rule  44.1  explicitly \nfocuses  on  what  a  court  may  consider  when \ndetermining  foreign  law,  but  is  silent  as  to  how a \ncourt  should  analyze  the  relevant  material  or \nsources. Thus, courts must still evaluate the relevant \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-7- \n\nsource  material  within  the  context  of  each  case.” In \nre Vitamin C, 837  F.3d  at  187.  But  this  reasoning \ncannot  be  reconciled  with  the  “bound-to-defer”  rule. \nIf  a  foreign  government’s  statements  were  binding \non  a  U.S.  court,  consideration  of  other  material \nwould be meaningless, for it would not be allowed to \ninfluence  the  court’s  determination,  even  if  that \nmaterial  is  highly  accurate  and  reliable.  Rule  44.1, \nafter  all,  calls  for  courts  to  “consider”  relevant \nsources.  See  MERRIAM-WEBSTER’S  COLLEGIATE \nDICTIONARY (11th ed. 2003) (defining consider as “to \nthink  about  carefully”  as  in  “to  think  of  esp.  with \nregard  to  taking  some  action”  or  “to  take  into \naccount”);  WEBSTER’S  COLLEGIATE  DICTIONARY  (5th \ned.  1948)  (defining  consider  as  “to  think  on  with \ncare”). At most, the Second Circuit’s rule would allow \nU.S. courts to consider other material for the narrow \npurpose \nforeign \nof  determining  whether  a \ngovernment’s interpretation is “reasonable under the \nthis \ncircumstances  presented”—but  even  with \nqualification,  the  “bound-to-defer”  rule  would  not \nallow  courts  to  “consider  any relevant  material  or \nsource”  for  the  fundamental  purpose  of  determining \nforeign  law  accurately,  as  Rule  44.1  authorizes \n(emphasis added). \n\nTo  support  its  “bound-to-defer”  rule,  the \nSecond  Circuit  relies  on United States v. Pink,  315 \nU.S.  203  (1942).  This  reliance  is  misplaced.  Most \nimportantly,  for  the  reasons  just  given,  the  Second \nCircuit’s  reading  of  Pink  as  stating  a  “bound-to-\ndefer” rule is inconsistent with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure  44.1,  which  entered  into  effect  in  1966, \nmore than 20 years after Pink was decided. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-8- \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  discounts  the  impact  of \nRule  44.1.  See In re Vitamin C, 837  F.3d  at  188 \n(“Rule  44.1  does  not  alter  the  legal  standards  by \nwhich courts analyze foreign law . . . .”). But by doing \nso  it  ignores  the  important  consequences  of  Rule \n44.1’s  adoption.  As  Wright  and  Miller  explain:  “The \nprocedure  for  proving  foreign  law  was  changed \nsubstantially  by  .  .  .  Rule  44.1.  .  .  .  Thus,  the  trial \ncourt’s  freedom  of  inquiry  no  longer  is  encumbered \nby  any  restraint  on  its  research  or  by  the  rules  of \nadmissibility  .  .  .  .  Since  the  rule  dissipates  former \ninhibitions on judicial inquiry, the district judge may \nconsider  any  material  the  parties  wish  to  present.” \nWRIGHT  &  MILLER,  FEDERAL  PRACTICE  AND \nPROCEDURE,  9A  FED.  PRAC.  &  PROC.  CIV.  §  2444  (3d \ned.).  Rule  44.1  also  abandoned  the  treatment  of \nforeign  law  issues  as  issues  of  fact,  and  established \nthat a determination of foreign law instead “must be \ntreated as a ruling on a question of law.” Fed. R. Civ. \nP.  44.1,  Notes  of  Advisory  Committee  on  Rules—\n1966  (“[T]he  court’s  determination  of  an  issue  of \nforeign law is to be treated as a ruling on a question \nof ‘law,’ not ‘fact’. . . .”). \n\nMoreover,  Pink was  an  appeal  from  a  New \nYork  state  court,  and  both  the  state  court  and  this \nCourt  applied  New  York  state  law  to  determine  the \ncontent  of  foreign  law  in  that  case. See  315  U.S.  at \n217-22 (discussing New York Civil Practice Act § 391 \nand \nits  requirement  to  treat  certain  “written \nauthorities”  as  “presumptive  evidence”  of  foreign \nlaw); see also Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a) (calling for district \ncourts,  at  the  time  of Pink,  to  apply  state  evidence \nlaw in some circumstances). One purpose of Federal \nthe  Federal  Rules  more \nRule  44.1—and  of \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-9- \n\nto  provide  a  uniform \n\ngenerally—was \nfederal \napproach  to  questions  of  procedure,  including  the \ndetermination  of  foreign  law.  The  first  sentence  of \nthe  Advisory  Committee  Notes  accompanying  the \nfirst version of Rule 44.1 stated: “Rule 44.1 is added \nby  amendment  to  furnish  Federal  courts  with  a \nuniform  and  effective  procedure  for  raising  and \ndetermining an issue concerning the law of a foreign \ncountry.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1,  Notes  of  Advisory \nCommittee  on  Rules—1966  (emphasis  added).  The \nNotes  further  explained  that  the  authorization  to \n“consider  any  relevant  material  or  source”  was \nexplicitly  designed  to  end  the  reliance  on  variable \nand  often  undesirable  state  laws.  See  id.2  For \nreasons  we  explain  shortly,  we  see  no  conflict \nbetween Pink and Rule 44.1. But even if there were \na conflict, Rule 44.1 would control today.  \n\nFurthermore,  it  is  far  from  clear  that  Pink \nstands  for  the  general  proposition  that  U.S.  courts \nare \nforeign  government \nstatements.

See Pink, 315 U.S. \nat  220  (explaining  that,  prior  to  treating  the \ndeclaration as conclusive, this Court determined that \n“the  evidence  supported  [the]  finding[]  that  the \nCommissariat  for  Justice  has  power  to  interpret \nexisting  Russian  law”);  id.  at  218  (explaining  that, \nalthough  this  Court  “[did]  not  stop  to  review  all  the \nevidence  in  the  voluminous  record”  on  the  question \nof Russian law, it accepted the stated interpretation \nonly  after  observing  “that  the  expert  testimony \ntendered by the United States gave great credence to \nits  position”).

McNab,  331  F.3d  1228  (11th  Cir.  2003).  In  that \ncase, defendant was convicted of violating the Lacey \nAct,  which  is  a  U.S.  statute  that  prohibits  the \nimportation of “fish or wildlife [that has been] taken, \npossessed, transported, or sold in violation of . . . any \nforeign  law.”  Id.  at  1232  (quoting  16  U.S.C.  § \n3372(a)(2)(A)).  Defendant’s  conviction  was  based  on \na  violation  of  Honduran  law.  Id. at  1232-34.  The \ndistrict  court  relied  on  statements  of  multiple \nHonduran  officials,  including  a  legal  officer  of  a \nHonduran  government  ministry  made  during  the \ninvestigation  and  trial,  that  the  relevant  law  was \nvalid.  Id.  at  1234-35.  But  after  defendant’s \nconviction, the Embassy of Honduras filed an amicus \nbrief  in  support  of  defendants,  arguing  that  the  law \n“was  of  no  force  and  effect,  because  it  was  not \nadopted  in  accordance  with  Honduran  law  and  thus \nit could not legally provide the basis for any violation \nof  Honduran  law.”  Brief  Amicus  Curiae  of  the \nEmbassy  of  Honduras  and  the  Asociacion  de \nPescadores  del  Caribe  in  Support  of  Defendant-\nAppellant  David  Henson  McNab,  2002  WL \n32595268,  at  *13.  The  Court  of  Appeals  for  the \nEleventh  Circuit  held  that  it  would  not  defer  to  the \nnew  Honduran  position. McNab,  331  F.3d at  1242. \nThe  Eleventh  Circuit  insisted  that  “[w]e  must  have \n\ngrounds  for  refusing  recognition  and  enforcement.  See, e.g., \nUniform Foreign-Country Money Judgments Recognition Act § \n4, \nat \navailable \nhttp://www.uniformlaws.org/shared/docs/foreign%20country%2\n0money%20judgments%20recognition/ufcmjra_final_05.pdf. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                                                         \n\f-15- \n\nconsistency and reliability from foreign governments \nwith respect to the validity of their laws.” Id. \n\nA  fundamental  flaw  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \n“bound-to-defer” rule is that it would prevent courts \nfrom  independently  weighing  information  about \nforeign  law  in  accordance  with  these  and  other \navailable  indicia  of  reliability  and  persuasiveness. \nThe  Second  Circuit’s  rule  would  require  courts  to \ndetermine  foreign  law  in  accordance  with  a  foreign \ngovernment’s  statements  even  if  those  statements \nhave  a  lower  degree  of  reliability  or  persuasiveness \nthan  other  information  before  the  court.  Indicia  of \nreliability  and  persuasiveness  would  only  matter  if \nthey so clearly tilted against a foreign government’s \nstatements as to render them not “reasonable under \nthe  circumstances.”  In re Vitamin C, 837  F.3d  at \n189.  The  principle  behind  the  determination  of \nforeign  law,  however,  is  to  arrive  at  an  accurate \ndetermination, not merely a reasonable one. \n\nThis flaw is especially serious at the appellate \nlevel. As the Second Circuit correctly observed, “[t]he \ndetermination  of  foreign  law  is  ‘a  question  of  law, \nwhich  is  subject  to  de novo  review.’”  Id.  at  183.  A \nprimary purpose of de novo review is to ensure that \nan  appellate  court  can  correct  a  district  court’s \ninaccurate  determination  of  the  content  or  meaning \nof  foreign  law.  See  McKesson  Corp.  v.  Islamic \nRepublic of Iran, 753 F.3d 239, 242 (D.C. Cir. 2014) \n(undertaking  “de  novo  review  of  the  district  court’s \ninterpretation  of  foreign  law”)  (emphasis  added); \nIracheta v.

P. 44.1, Notes \nof  Advisory  Committee  on  Rules—1966  (“[T]he \ncourt’s determination of an issue of foreign law is to \nbe treated as a ruling on a question of ‘law,’ not ‘fact,’ \nso  that  appellate  review  will  not  be  narrowly \nconfined  by  the  ‘clearly  erroneous’  standard  of  Rule \n52(a).”);  John  G.

Yet  the  Second  Circuit’s  review \nwas  based  more  on  deference  than  accuracy.  As  the \nSecond  Circuit \nitself  states:  “[I]f  the  Chinese \nGovernment had not appeared in this litigation, the \ndistrict court’s careful and thorough treatment of the \nevidence  before  it  in  analyzing  what  Chinese  law \nrequired . . . would have been entirely appropriate.” \nIn re Vitamin C, 837 F.3d at 191 n.10. \n\nC. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S RULE \nVIOLATES THE PRINCIPLE OF \nJUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE IN THE \nDETERMINATION OF FOREIGN \nLAW. \n\nThe bedrock principle of judicial independence \napplies  to  all  determinations  of  law  by  U.S.  courts, \nincluding  determinations  of  foreign  law. See Garcia \nv. Pinelo, 808 F.3d 1158, 1163 (7th Cir. 2015) (“‘[I]n \ndetermining  these  questions  of  [foreign]  law,  both \ntrial and appellate courts are urged to research and \nanalyze  foreign  law  independently.’  This  is  because \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-17- \n\n‘one  of  the  policies  inherent  in  Rule  44.1  is  that \nwhenever  possible  issues  of  foreign  law  should  be \nresolved  on  their  merits  and  on  the  basis  of  a  full \nevaluation  of  the  available  materials.’”)  (citations \nomitted); de Fontbrune v.

First,  it  would  impose  on  U.S.  courts  a \nparticular  interpretation  of  foreign  law—that  of  an \nappearing foreign government—rather than allowing \nU.S.  courts  to  determine  foreign  law  independently \nbased  on  indicia  of  reliability  and  persuasiveness \nsuch  as  those  discussed  above.  Second,  the  “bound-\nto-defer”  rule  would  render  meaningless \nthe \nauthority  Rule  44.1  gives  courts  to  do  independent \nresearch  on  foreign  law.  The  Second  Circuit’s \n“bound-to-defer”  rule  thus  would  be  just  the  sort  of \n“judge-made  doctrine  for  the  abdication  of  the \njudicial  duty”  to  interpret  law  that  has  raised \nconcerns in other contexts. See Gutierrez-Brizuela v. \nLynch,  834  F.3d  1142,  1152  (10th  Cir.  2016) \n(Gorsuch,  J.).  In  this  case,  the  bound-to-defer  rule \nwould  require  adopting  the  Chinese  ministry’s \nstatement  even  though  the  trial  court  found  that \n“the  plain  language  of  the  documentary  evidence \nsubmitted  by  plaintiffs  directly  contradicts  the \nMinistry’s  position.”  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust \nLitigation, 584 F. Supp. 2d 546, 557 (E.D.N.Y. 2008). \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-19- \n\nII. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S RULE IS \nINCONSISTENT WITH FOREIGN AND \nINTERNATIONAL PRACTICE. \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  bound-to-defer  standard \nis inconsistent not only with basic American conflict-\nof-laws  principles,  but  also  with \nforeign  and \ninternational  practice.  Foreign  courts  are  not \nsubjected  to  the  “bound-to-defer”  rule  that  the \nSecond  Circuit  would  impose  on  U.S.  courts,  and \ntreaties  on  the  determination  of  foreign  law  show \nthat  foreign  governments  do  not  expect  that  sort  of \ndeference  from  each  other.  Indeed,  the  fundamental \nprinciples  of  accuracy  and  independence  in  the \ndetermination of foreign law that underpin Rule 44.1 \nare  widely  recognized  in  foreign  and  international \npractice. \n\nA. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S RULE IS \nINCONSISTENT WITH FOREIGN \nPRACTICE. \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  bound-to-defer  rule \nwould impose a more rigid rule of deference on U.S. \ncourts  than  foreign  countries  impose  on  their  own \ncourts.  As  the  United  States  has  stated  in  this \nlitigation, the Department of Justice “is not aware of \nthe \nany \nDepartment’s  representations  are  entitled  to  such \nconclusive  weight.”  Brief  for  the  United  States  as \nAmicus Curiae on Petition for a Writ of Certiorari at \n11-12. \n\nforeign-court  decision  holding \n\nthat \n\nThe  United  States’  assessment  is  consistent \nwith  a  recent  study  of  how  34  nations  in  Europe, \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-20- \n\nNorth and South America, the Asia-Pacific Area, and \nAfrica  treat  foreign  law,  which  found  that  the  large \nmajority of these nations do not require their courts \nto  be  bound  by  information  about  foreign  law.

While  the  ordinary \nRule  44.1  approach  to  issues  of  foreign  law  is \nunlikely to raise comity concerns, a “bound-to-defer” \napproach may raise such concerns.  \n\nA. \n\nA RULE REQUIRING DEFERENCE IS \nINAPPROPRIATE BECAUSE IT \nWOULD ALLOW FOREIGN \nGOVERNMENTS TO UNDULY \nINFLUENCE THE APPLICATION OF \nU.S. LAW. \n\nThe  proper  application  of  American \nlaw \nfrequently  depends  on  the  determination  of  foreign \nlaw.  For  example,  foreign  law  determines  whether \nforeign corporations have the capacity to sue and be \nsued in U.S. courts; defendants in breach of contract \ncases  may  plead  a  defense  of  supervening  foreign \nillegality;  domestic  statutes  may  create  liability  for \nconduct  in  violation  of  foreign  law;  the  protection \nagainst  self-incrimination  may  apply  to  potential \nforeign  prosecutions;  courts  manage  civil  discovery \nin \nlaws  that  affect  potential \ncompliance;  extraterritorial  service  of  process  in \nfederal  court  is  permissible  as  prescribed  by  the \nforeign  country’s  law;  foreign  laws  may  be  relevant \n\nlight  of \n\nforeign \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-27- \n\nto  venue  questions  in  U.S.  courts;  laws  creating \nexceptions for double taxation require an assessment \nof  whether  foreign  tax  liability  attaches;  resolution \nof  various  types  of  disputes  requires  determination \nof the validity of a foreign marriage; and—as in this \ncase—foreign  law  determines  whether  a  party  can \nsuccessfully  raise  the  defense  of  foreign  sovereign \ncompulsion.  See  Zachary  D.  Clopton,  Judging \nForeign States,  94  WASH.  U.  L.  REV.  1,  15-17  (2016) \n(collecting sources and other examples); see also The \nAmistad,  40  U.S.  518,  520,  593-97  (1841)  (Story,  J.) \n(applying  this  Court’s  independent  interpretation  of \nSpanish law to free captured slaves and to reject as \nevidence of their ownership the “public documents of \nthe  [Spanish]  government”  that  accompanied  the \nvessel).  \n\nIn  these  situations  the  determination  of \nforeign law fundamentally influences the application \nof  domestic  law  and  hence  the  implementation  of \ndomestic  policy.  It  is  therefore  crucial  that  U.S. \ncourts  retain \nindependently \nto \ndetermine foreign law in these cases. \n\nthe  authority \n\ncourts \n\nthat  U.S. \nof \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  “bound-to-defer”  rule \nwould  inappropriately  delegate  this  authority  from \nforeign  government  actors  by \nU.S.  courts  to \nrequiring \nthe \ndeterminations \nforeign  government  actors \nappearing  in  U.S.  court  and  by  barring  U.S.  courts \nfrom independently determining foreign law as they \nare  authorized  to  do  under  Rule  44.1.  This \ndelegation  would  allow  foreign  governments  to \ninfluence  the  application  of  American  law  in  a  wide \nrange  of  cases—even  though  foreign  governments \n\ndefer \n\nto \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-28- \n\nlack the same interest as U.S. courts in ensuring the \nproper  application  of  American  law.  The  Second \nCircuit’s “bound-to-defer” rule would have this effect \nwhenever  the  application  of  American  law  depends \non  the  determination  of  foreign  law  and  a  foreign \ngovernment  decides  to  submit  an  official  statement \ninterpreting  that  law.  For  example,  the  Second \nCircuit’s  rule  would  seem  to  permit  a  foreign \ngovernment  to  intervene  in  any  case  against  a \nforeign  corporation  and  conclusively  declare  that \ncorporation not capable of being sued in a U.S. court. \nSee  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  17(b)(2)  (“Capacity  to  sue  or  be \nsued is determined . . . for a corporation, by the law \nunder which it was organized . . . .”). See also United \nStates v. McNab,  331  F.3d  1228,  1242  (11th  Cir. \n2003)  (“[I]t  is  not  difficult  to  imagine  a  Lacey  Act \ndefendant  in  the  future,  who  has  the  means  and \nconnections  in  a  foreign  country,  lobbying  and \nprevailing  upon  that  country’s  officials  to  invalidate \na  particular  law  serving  as  the  basis  for  his \nconviction  in  the  United  States.  .  .  .There  would \ncease  to  be  any  reason  to  enforce  the  Lacey  Act,  at \nleast  with  respect  to  foreign  law  violations,  if  every \nchange of position by a foreign government as to the \nvalidity of its laws could invalidate a conviction.”). \n\nIn  the  antitrust  setting,  there  are  special \nreasons  for  U.S.  courts  to  determine  foreign  law \nindependently—and  not  simply  defer  to  foreign \ngovernment  statements  about  foreign  law.  In  some \ncases,  statements  may  be  submitted  “to  shield  the \nforeign defendants from liability in the U.S., even if \ntheir \nanticompetitive.”  Marek \nMartyniszyn,  Foreign  States’  Amicus  Curiae \nParticipation in U.S. Antitrust Cases, 61 ANTITRUST \n\nconduct  was \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-29- \n\nto \n\nforeign  governments, \n\nBULL. 611, 630 (2016).

These  doctrines  are  distinct \nfrom the question before the Court in this case.12 \n\nforeign  discovery, \n\ninjunctions, \n\nIn  any  event,  because  the  Second  Circuit’s \n“bound-to-defer” rule is inconsistent with foreign and \ninternational  practice,  see  supra  Part  II,  it  is \nunlikely  that  a  foreign  government  could  genuinely \nview  a  U.S.  court’s  respectful  but  independent \n\n12  Because  the  Second  Circuit  did  not  rule  on  Respondent’s \nact of state doctrine and foreign sovereign compulsion defenses, \nand  because  this  Court  decided  not  to  review  the  Second \nCircuit’s decision to abstain on grounds of international comity, \nthis  Court  should  address  only  how  foreign  law  should  be \ndetermined  and  should  not  address  how  any  of  the \ninternational  comity  doctrines  potentially  implicated  in  this \ncase should be applied. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f-33- \n\ndetermination  of  foreign  law  as  a  violation  of \nprinciples of international comity. \n\n“bound-to-defer”  rule \n\nMore  specifically,  Respondent  suggests  that \nthe  Second  Circuit’s \nis \nnecessary  to  prevent  U.S.  courts  from  causing \noffense to foreign governments by speculating about \nforeign  government  motives.  See,  e.g.,  Brief  in \nOpposition  at  26,  Animal  Science  Products,  Inc.  v. \nHebei  Welcome  Pharmaceutical  Co.,  No.  16-1220 \n(U.S. June 5, 2017) (“The district court’s speculation \nabout  the  Chinese  government’s  motives  illustrate \nthe problem.”). \n\nBut \n\nthere \n\ninterests).  For  example, \n\nis  nothing  sacrosanct  about \ngovernment  motives.  See Clopton,  supra,  at  10-23 \nin \n(collecting  examples  of  U.S.  courts  sitting \njudgment  of  foreign  governments,  foreign  laws, \nforeign legal acts, foreign legal systems, and foreign \ngovernment \nin  W.S. \nKirkpatrick & Co. v. Environmental Tectonics Corp., \n493 U.S. 400 (1990), this Court held that dismissal of \na  suit  under  the  act  of  state  doctrine  was  improper, \nthus allowing the suit to proceed despite the District \nCourt’s  finding  that  the  suit  could  “impugn  or \nquestion \nforeign  nation’s \nmotivations.”  Id.  at  408-10.  Moreover,  in  suits \nagainst  foreign  governments  under  the  Foreign \nSovereign  Immunities  Act,  U.S.  courts  may  assess \nthe  legal  liability  of  foreign  governments,  which, \ndepending on the elements of the claim, may require \ncourts  to  make  findings  about  the  purpose  or  intent \nof \nthe \nforeign  government  actions.

A  court \nforeign \nfaced  with  a  potentially  unreliable \ngovernment \nto \nindependently \nstatement’s \npersuasiveness  and  then  to  explain  honestly  the \nbasis of that independent evaluation. If a court were \nbound  to  defer  to  an  unreliable  statement,  as  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  would  require,  then  there  is  a \nrisk  that  the  court  would  be  tempted  to  invoke \nabstention-like  options  that  might  not  otherwise  be \nappropriate.  Cf.  Colo.  River Water  Conservation \nDist. v. United States,  424  U.S.  800,  817  (1976) \n(describing the “virtually unflagging obligation of the \nfederal  courts  to  exercise  the  jurisdiction  given \nthem”).  \n\nC. \n\nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S “BOUND-\nTO-DEFER” APPROACH RAISES \nCOMPLEX QUESTIONS OF \nFOREIGN LAW THAT MIGHT \nTHEMSELVES RAISE \nINTERNATIONAL COMITY \nCONCERNS. \n\nDirecting  U.S.  courts  to  defer  to  foreign \ngovernment  determinations  of  law  sounds  simple, \nbut  in  fact  this  approach  would  raise  challenging \nquestions  and  would  risk  offense  to  international \ncomity, thus undermining its chief justification. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-35- \n\nA  rule  that  requires  deference  to  certain \nforeign  government  statements  implies  that  courts \nwould  have  to  decide  which  foreign  statements \nreceive  this  treatment.  For  example,  U.S.  courts \nwould  presumably  have  to  determine  which  foreign \ngovernment  institutions  are  permitted  to  make \nauthoritative  statements  about  foreign  law.13  This \ndetermination  likely  would  require  government-by-\ngovernment  assessments,  and  may  vary  depending \non  the  allocation  of  authority  within  each  country \n(e.g.,  parliamentary  versus  presidential  versus \nnondemocratic).  The  choice  also  could  depend  on \nwhether  the  foreign  law  in  question  is  judge-made \nlaw, \nlegislation,  executive  order  or  decree,  or \nadministrative  regulation.  Courts  would  have  to \ndecide  how  to  respond  if  the  foreign  government \nexperienced  a  change  in  position  (or  leadership) \nbetween  the  underlying  conduct  and  the  litigation, \nor if two branches of a foreign government submitted \nconflicting  determinations.  And  at  least  in  some \ncircumstances,  the  Second  Circuit  suggests  that  the \n“reasonableness”  of  foreign  government  statements \nmay  still  be  scrutinized.  See In re Vitamin C, 837 \nF.3d at 189. \n\nAsking courts to make these determinations is \nat  least  as  likely  to  raise  international  comity \nconcerns as the existing Rule 44.1 approach. Because \nthe  Second  Circuit’s \nis \ninconsistent with foreign and international practice, \n\n“bound-to-defer”  rule \n\n13 In many cases, this authority might be sensibly assumed \nwhen  the  foreign  government  entity  is  a  foreign  country’s \nhighest  court;  but  the  inquiry  may  be  far  more  complex  when \nforeign government entities other than courts are involved. \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f-36- \n\nforeign \n\nit  is  unlikely  that  a  foreign  government  could \ngenuinely  view  a  U.S.  court’s  respectful  but \nin \nindependent  determination  of \naccordance with Rule 44.1 as a violation of principles \nof international comity. See supra Part II. But under \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  approach,  foreign  governments \ncould  be  offended  when  U.S.  courts  categorize  some \nof  their  government  actors  as  authoritative  and \nothers not, and some of their statements “reasonable \nunder the circumstances” and others not.  \n\nlaw \n\nIV.  U.S. COURTS SHOULD GIVE RESPECTFUL \n\nCONSIDERATION TO A FOREIGN \nGOVERNMENT’S STATEMENT ABOUT \nFOREIGN LAW, BUT THEY STILL MUST \nDETERMINE FOREIGN LAW \nINDEPENDENTLY.  \n\ngive \n\nU.S. \n\ncourts \n\nshould \n\nrespectful \nconsideration  to  a  foreign  government’s  statements \nabout its law. See STEPHEN BREYER, THE COURT AND \nTHE  WORLD:  AMERICAN  LAW  AND  THE  NEW  GLOBAL \nREALITIES  92  (2015)  (“[O]ur  Court  does,  and  should, \nlisten to foreign voices, to those who understand and \ncan illuminate relevant foreign laws and practices.”); \ncf. Sanchez-Llamas v. Oregon,  548  U.S.  331,  353 \n(2006)  (noting  that  the  International  Court  of \nJustice’s \n“deserves \n‘respectful consideration,’” but declining to be bound \nby  that  interpretation) (quoting  Breard v. Greene, \n523  U.S.  371,  375  (1998)  (per  curiam)).  This \nrespectful  consideration \nis  consistent  with  the \nprinciples of judicial independence and accuracy that \nunderpin  the  determination  of  foreign  law  under \nRule 44.1. \n\ninterpretation  of  a \n\ntreaty \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-37- \n\nrather \n\nformalize \n\nIndeed,  in  some  cases  U.S.  courts  may  find  it \nhelpful  to  actively  seek  information  about  foreign \nlaw from a foreign government. Efforts to clarify the \nprocess  for  foreign  government  participation  in  U.S. \nlitigation  should  be  pursued,  and  such  participation \nshould  be  encouraged.  See,  e.g.,  Communication  to \nCourts,  1978  Digest  of  United  States  Practice  in \nInternational  Law  ch.  4,  §  1  at  560-63  (describing \nthis Court’s efforts to encourage foreign governments \nthan \nfile  amicus  briefs \nto  directly \ncommunicating  to  U.S.  courts  through  the  State \nDepartment).  Efforts \ninter-court \nto \nrelationships seem especially promising. See, e.g., 11 \nU.S.C. \ncourt-to-court \n(providing \ncommunication  in  cross-border  bankruptcy  cases); \nMemorandum  of  Understanding  Between  the  Chief \nJustice  of  New  South  Wales  and  the  Chief  Judge  of \nthe State of New York on References of Questions of \nLaw \nat \nhttp://www.supremecourt.justice.nsw.gov.au/Pages/s\nco2_practiceprocedure/sco2_internationaljudicialcoop\neration/SCO2_agreement_newyork.aspx \n(providing \nfor  cooperation  between  New  York  state  courts  and \nthe  courts  of  New  South  Wales  in  resolution  of \nquestions  of  the  other’s  law);  see  also  Lehman \nBrothers v. Schein,  416  U.S.  386,  390-91  (1974) \n(praising  the  use  of  the  formal  certified-question \nprocedure in domestic interjurisdictional cases). \n\navailable \n\n§  1525 \n\n2017), \n\n(Feb. \n\nfor \n\n2, \n\nBut a foreign government’s statements cannot \nbe  binding  on  U.S.  courts.  Instead,  U.S.  courts \nshould  accurately  and  independently  determine  the \nmeaning  of  foreign  law  taking  into  account  not  only \na  foreign  government’s  own  statements,  but  also \nother  relevant  information  about  that  law,  as \n\nSMRH:485598733.2 \n\n-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f-38- \n\nexpressly authorized by Rule 44.1. This independent \napproach  is  especially  important  when—as  in  this \ncase  and  many  other  cases—the  proper  application \nof  American  law  depends  on  the  determination  of \nforeign law. Cf. BREYER, supra, at 7 (“I do not ignore \nthe  basic  fact  that  the  American  people  can  and \nmust  democratically  determine  their  own  laws.”). \nJust  as  U.S.  courts  should  respectfully  consider \nforeign government statements, foreign governments \nshould respect the independence of U.S. courts when \nruling on questions of law. \n\nThe  Second  Circuit’s  “bound-to-defer”  rule  is \nunnecessary  to  promote  the  respectful  consideration \nof foreign government statements about foreign law. \nRule \nthe \nconsideration  of  “any  relevant  material  or  source”—\nand the principle of accuracy in the determination of \nforeign  law,  already  ensure  this.
