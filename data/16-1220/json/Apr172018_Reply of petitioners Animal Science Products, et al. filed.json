        "1 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nU.S. \n\nto  defer \n\ncourts  are  not  bound \n\nto \ninterpretations  of  foreign  law  offered  by  appearing \nforeign  sovereigns.  “Deference  does  not  mean \nacquiescence,”  Presley  v.  Etowah  Cnty.  Comm’n,  502 \nU.S. 491, 508 (1992), and the District Court was not \nrelieved  of  its  obligation  to  decide  the  questions  of \nforeign law before it because the Chinese Ministry of \nCommerce (“Ministry”) filed an amicus brief.  \n\nThe  District  Court  followed  a  well-trodden  path \nby  applying  a  “substantial  deference”  standard.  The \nUnited  States  endorsed  the  standard  fifteen  years \nago,  and  it  was  the  prevailing  approach  prior  to  the \ndecision  below.  A  substantial  deference  standard \nthe  completeness, \npermits  courts \nto  consider \nlegal \nof \nconsistency,  and  authority \nstatements,  and  it  is  consistent  with  principles  of \ninternational  comity  and  international  practice.  The \nrules  favored  by  the  Ministry  and  Respondents \nwould require deference to interpretations of foreign \nlaw that U.S. courts find inconclusive, inaccurate, or \neven  misleading.  Courts  can  and  will  benefit  from \nforeign  sovereigns  under  a \nthe  expertise  of \nsubstantial  deference  standard—there  is  no  reason \nto  resort  to  the  artificial  constraints  of  an  ill-\nconceived rule.   \n\nforeign \n\nThe  Ministry’s  warnings  of  diplomatic  chaos  ring \nhollow.  No  other  government  has  endorsed  the \nMinistry’s position. Instead, the Executive Branch—\nwhich unlike this Court has authority and expertise \nin matters of foreign relations—has appeared in this \nCourt \nsupporting  Petitioners  notwithstanding \nChina’s protests.",
        "2 \n\nThe  District  Court  appropriately  applied  a \n“substantial deference” standard that permitted it to \nconsider the thoroughness, consistency, and accuracy \nof the Ministry’s brief. The Ministry does not dispute \nthat  its  presentation  of  Chinese  law  was  incomplete \nand  inaccurate—it  repeatedly  cited  provisions  of  a \nrepealed  version  of  the  Vitamin-C  Subcommittee \nCharter  as  though  they  remained  in  force,  declined \nto  interpret  relevant  provisions  of  the  regulatory \nthe  District  Court  no \nscheme,  and  offered \nexplanation of its conflicting statements to the World \nTrade Organization (“WTO”).  \n\nThe District Court’s interpretation of Chinese law \nwas not “nonsensical”—and it was far more thorough \nthan  the  cursory  examination  on  which  the  Second \nCircuit  relied.  Following  its  accession  to  the  WTO, \nChina  sought  to  avoid  anti-dumping  penalties.  In \nthat  context,  the  requirement  that  the  Chamber \n“verify the submissions by the exporters based on the \nindustry  agreements,”  JA105,  made  perfect  sense \nalongside price agreements that were encouraged but \nnot  mandated.  Such  a  system  permitted  profitable \nexports  to  continue  when  agreements  could  not  be \nreached, but offered a mechanism for enforcing anti-\ndumping minima when agreements were achievable. \nFar  from  being  a  theoretical  construct  invented  by \nthe  District  Court,  the  record  showed  this  to  be  the \nactual  system  in  place  during  the  class  period,  and \nthe  agreements  for  which  Respondents  were  held \nliable were not required by it. Pet. Br. 10-11.",
        "3 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  The  Second  Circuit’s  Binding  Deference \n\nStandard Should Be Reversed.  \n\nA.  There  is  No  Legal  Support  for  a  Binding \n\nDeference Standard. \n\n1.  Petitioners  have  previously  explained  why  the \nSecond  Circuit’s \nconclusive \nrule  amounts \ndeference. Supp. Br. for Pet. 3-7. Respondents do not \ndefend the merits of a conclusive deference standard, \nbut  instead  endorse  a  “modest  holding”  that  directs \ncourts to “defer if reasonable.” Resp. Br. 20, 22. That \nis not what the panel held.  \n\nto \n\nthe \n\n“reasonable  under \n\na.  In  the  sentence  immediately  following  the \nphrase \ncircumstances \npresented,”  the  panel  explained  that  “[i]f  deference \nby  any  measure  is  to  mean  anything,  it  must  mean \nthat  a  U.S.  court  not  embark  on  a  challenge  to  a \nforeign  government’s  official  representation  to  the \ncourt regarding its laws or regulations. . . .” Pet. App. \n25a-26a.  The  Ministry  attempts  to  limit  the  court’s \n“do not challenge” command to inquiries based upon \nU.S.  legal  principles,  but  the  panel’s  interpretation \nwas  more  expansive.  Under  the  panel’s  test,  a  court \nmay  not  question  a  sovereign’s  representations  by \ncomparing  them  to  information  submitted  by  a  non-\nsovereign \nsovereign \nstatements,  or  information  discovered  by  the  court’s \nown  research.  Rather,  the  only  exception  is  where \n“no  documentary  evidence  or  reference  of  law  [is] \nproffered”  to  support  the  interpretation.  Pet.  App. \n25a  n.8.  That  approach  would  limit  Rule  44.1 \ninquiries  to  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  the \nrepresentation on its face.  \n\nconflicting \n\nparty, \n\nprior",
        "4 \n\nb.  The  rigidity  of  the  Second  Circuit’s  rule  is \nevident  from  its  reversal  of  the  District  Court’s \ndenial  of  Respondents’  motion  to  dismiss.  Pet.  App. \n2a n.2. The District Court’s only holding at that time \nwas  that  “the  record  as  it  stands  is  simply  too \nambiguous  to  foreclose  further  inquiry  into  the \nvoluntariness of defendants’ actions.” Pet. App. 186a. \nTo hold that the District Court abused its discretion \nby  permitting  discovery  must  mean  that  the  court \nlacked  authority  to  consider  materials  beyond  the \nMinistry’s brief. \n\nthat \n\nclaims \n\nThe  Ministry  now \n\nconclusive \ndeference  does  not  limit  a  court’s  discretion  to \nconsider  extrinsic  materials,  Ministry  Br.  25,  but \nsaid the opposite below. The Ministry argued that its \namicus  brief  required  the  District  Court  “to  ignore” \nPetitioners’  expert  testimony,  CAJA  A622,  and \nfurther  urged  that,  “unless  the  Court  makes  an \naffirmative  finding  that  it  finds  [the  Ministry’s] \npresentation  inherently  non-believable,  the  only \nproper  disposition  is  to  credit  the  government’s \nfinding and to foreclose an inquiry into what the law \nsays  and  other  findings,”  id.  (emphasis  added).  The \npanel ultimately adopted that view. \n\nare \n\nthat \n\nunpersuasive, \n\nc.  Even  with  Respondents’  gloss,  the  panel’s \nstandard  would  still  require  deference  to  legal \ninterpretations \nyet \nnonetheless  “reasonable  under  the  circumstances.” \nPet.  App.  25a.  Such  a  test  is  indistinguishable  from \nthe  standard  applied  under  Chevron.  But  the \nMinistry’s  brief  would  not  pass  muster  under  a \nChevron-like  rule,  Pet.  Br.  48-55,  and  there  is  no \nbasis  for  substituting  such  a  rule  for  the  discretion \nRule 44.1 contemplates.",
        "5 \n\nRespondents  and  the  Ministry  misapprehend  the \nimport  of  this  Court’s  cases  involving  deference  to \nadministrative  agencies.  Pet.  Br.  47-57.  This  Court \nhas  countenanced  standards  of  binding  deference \nbased  upon  an  implied  congressional  delegation  of \nrulemaking  authority  to  an  agency.  Even  in  that \ncontext there are substantial limits to deference that \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  rule  ignores,  id.  at  48-55,  and \noutside  that  context,  deference  is  not  required  even \nwhen an interpretation appears reasonable, id. at 54. \nthe  Ministry  offers  no  persuasive \nSimilarly, \njustification \nforeign  trade \nministry  receive  more  respect  than  the  highest \nranking  law-enforcement  official  of  a  U.S.  state.  Id. \nat 56-57. \n\ninsisting  that  a \n\nfor \n\n2.  There  is  no  place  for  a  conclusive  deference \nstandard  under  Rule  44.1.  Pet.  Br.  31-38.  While  the \nrule  permits  courts  to  “consider  any  relevant \nmaterial  or  source”  in  interpreting  foreign  law,  the \nSecond  Circuit  held  that  courts  may  not  rely  upon \nmaterials  beyond  the  four  corners  of  the  sovereign’s \nstatement.  In  holding  that  the  District  Court \ncommitted  legal  error  by  permitting  discovery  to \nproceed,  the  panel  held  that  all  of  the  materials \ndeveloped  during  discovery  and  trial  were  unworthy \nof  consideration.  Pet.  App.  2a  n.2,  30a.  A  court’s \ndiscretion  to  “decide  what  weight  is  to  be  given  to \ninformation  obtained  from  any  of  these  sources,” \nFremont v. United States, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 542, 557 \n(1855),  is  pointless  if  relying  upon  such  sources \nconstitutes reversible error.  \n\nContrary to the Ministry’s claim, Ministry Br. 11, \nthis  Court’s  decision  in  Fremont  did  not  grant \nconclusive  weight  to  any  legal  interpretation  offered",
        "6 \n\nInstead, \n\ngovernment. \n\nthe  Mexican \n\nby \nthe \ninterpretation  of  Mexican  law  on  which  this  Court \nrelied was rendered in 1844, a decade before Fremont \nwas decided. Fremont, 58 U.S. (17 How.) at 561. And \nthe  interpretation  that  this  Court  accepted  was  a \npre-litigation  decision  by  Mexican  authorities  not  to \nenforce  procedures  that  Mexican  laws  purported  to \nrequire—in  other  words,  this  Court  held  that \nMexico’s  laws  as  written  should  be  read  in  light  of \nhow  Mexican  officials  had  implemented  them  in \npractice.  Id.  at  561-62.  Under  Fremont,  the  Second \nCircuit  erred  in  holding  that  the  District  Court \nshould  not  have  considered  pre-litigation  evidence \nrelating  to  enforcement,  including  the  Chamber’s \npractice  of  permitting  exports  that  did  not  comply \nwith  the  Ministry’s  interpretation  of  the  regulatory \nscheme. Pet. App. 32a.  \n\nThe  Ministry’s  consecutive \n\n“[n]ever  before” \ndeclarations,  Ministry  Br.  23,  misunderstand  U.S. \nlaw. Since the enactment of Rule 44.1, federal courts \nhave  thought  it  highly  “desirable”—and  necessary—\nto  review  questions  of  foreign  law  de  novo,  even \nwhere  foreign  sovereign  legal  interpretations  are \ninvolved.  E.g.  Riggs  Nat’l  Corp.  &  Subsidiaries  v. \nComm’r  of  Internal  Revenue  Serv.,  163  F.3d  1363, \n1368  (D.C.  Cir.  1999)  (“We  are  .  .  .  hesitant  to  treat \nan interpretation of law as an act of state, for such a \nview  might  be  in  tension  with  rules  of  procedure \ndirecting  U.S.  courts  to  conduct  a  de  novo  review  of \nforeign law when an issue of foreign law is raised.”). \n\n3.  Requiring  conclusive  deference  would  sacrifice \nthe  accuracy  of  foreign  law  determinations  by \nprivileging  the  identity  of  the  interpreter  above  the \ncontent of the interpretation. Pet. Br. 31-39. Reliance",
        "7 \n\non a foreign sovereign’s legal statement may enhance \naccuracy  in  some  cases,  but  that  is  not  a  reason  to \nrequire  conclusive  deference  in  all  cases.  There  is \nalso  no  justification  for  a  rule  that  would  grant \nconclusive deference to an amicus brief submitted by \na foreign sovereign’s U.S. counsel, but not to a duly-\nenacted \nforeign  agency,  an \ninterpretive letter of a foreign minister, a decision of \na  foreign  court,  or  a  sworn  affidavit  of  a  non-\nappearing foreign official. Pet. App. 30a n.10.1 \n\nregulation  of  a \n\nincentives”  to  explain  their \n\nThe  Ministry  argues  that  foreign  governments \n“have  strong \nlaws \naccurately in U.S. courts, Ministry Br. 18, but those \nincentives  failed  to  keep  the  Ministry  honest  here, \ninfra at 15-19, and the incentive to protect domestic \nindustry is also powerful. Further, the consequences \nof  inaccuracy  are  different  when  the  interpretation \nconcerns  repealed \nlaws.  Unlike  the  “existing” \nRussian  law  interpreted  by  the  Commissariat  in \nUnited  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S.  203,  220  (1942),  the \nMinistry’s  interpretation  described  a  legal  regime \n\n1 The Ministry appears to believe that conclusive deference \napplies  only  when  sovereigns  appear  as  amici.  The  Ministry \nargues that multiple briefs filed by the Islamic Republic of Iran \nin  McKesson  HBOC,  Inc.  v.  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  271  F.3d \n1101  (D.C.  Cir.  2001),  did  not  receive  conclusive  deference \nbecause they did not offer an “official interpretation of Iranian \nlaw” (the Ministry ignores McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic \nof  Iran,  672  F.3d  1066  (D.C.  Cir.  2012)).  Ministry  Br.  14.  But \nthe Ministry’s only interpretation of Chinese law at the motion-\nto-dismiss  stage  was  its  amicus  brief  signed  by  U.S.  counsel, \nand that brief was no more “official” than the briefs Iran filed as \na party in McKesson.",
        "8 \n\nthat  Respondents  abandoned  after  Petitioners  filed \nsuit, Pet. Br 13. \n\nrule \n\n“clear” \n\ncould  be \n\n4.  The  Ministry  zigzags  between  defending  a \n“clear”  rule  of  conclusive  deference,  Ministry  Br.  22-\n23,  and  a  standard  that  permits  courts  to  “consider \nany  relevant  material”  and  defer  only  if  “reasonable \nunder the circumstances,” id. at 24. But the only way \nthe  Ministry’s \nis  by \ninappropriately  limiting  the  discretion  contemplated \nby Rule 44.1. Pet. Br. 27-39. A standard that applies \nonly  to  “reasonable”  interpretations,  Ministry  Br.  4, \nwould  be  hopelessly  indeterminate  absent  guidance \non  what  is  reasonable,  including  what  (if  any) \nextrinsic materials a court may consider when those \nmaterials  contradict  a  sovereign’s  amicus  brief.  In \nany  event,  Respondents  and  the  Ministry  cannot \ncredibly  oppose  “open-ended  balancing  tests”—the \ncomity  defense  they  would  have  this  Court  affirm  is \na meandering ten-factor test that offers no guidance \non  the  respective  weight  to  be  accorded  to  those \nfactors. See Pet. App. 220a-222a.  \n\nB.  United  States  v.  Pink  Does  Not  Support \nthe Second Circuit’s Deference Standard.  \n\n1.  Respondents  misleadingly  assert  that  “[t]his \nCourt  has  never  deviated  from  the  clear  rule  of \ndeference  established  in  Pink  more  than  75  years \nago,”  Resp.  Br.  25.  Pink  did  not  establish  a \nprospective  rule  of  deference,  let  alone  a  “clear  rule \nof  deference”  that  controls  this  case.  Pet.  Br.  40-41. \nThe  deference  owed  to  an  “official  declaration”  of  a \nforeign  sovereign  was  not  a  question  presented  in \nPink, and this Court did not analyze it. 315 U.S. 203, \n219  (1942).  Nor  did  this  Court  hold  that  legal",
        "9 \n\narguments  offered  by  a  foreign  ministry’s  amicus \nbrief,  absent  endorsement  of  the  Executive  Branch \nas  this  Court  credited  in  Pink,  ought  to  always  or \neven generally receive conclusive deference.  \n\nContrary  to  the  Ministry’s  claim,  Ministry  Br.  9, \nPink  did  not  hold  that  it  would  be  inappropriate  to \nconsider  “the  evidence  in  the  voluminous  record”  of \nthe  New  York  courts’  Moscow  Fire  cases  because  of \nthe  Commissariat’s  declaration,  Pink,  315  U.S.  at \n218.  This  Court  did  not  explain  why  it  declined  to \nreview  the  “voluminous”  record  before  the  referee, \n“except to note that the expert testimony tendered by \nits \nthe  United  States  gave  great  credence  to \nposition,” id., and there is no reason to presume that \nthis  Court  would  have  reached  the  same  result  had \nthe United States taken a contrary position. \n\n2.  Pink  illustrates  the  infirmity  of  a  conclusive \ndeference  rule.  Pet.  Br.  42-43.  The  Commissariat’s \n“power  to  interpret  existing  Russian  law”  was \nessential  to  this  Court’s  finding  that  its  declaration \nwas “conclusive.” Pink, 315 U.S. at 219. Respondents \nconcede  that  who  has  the  power  to  interpret  foreign \nlaw  is  a  question  of  foreign  law,  yet  do  not  explain \nhow  courts  should  decide  that  question.  Ordinarily, \nsuch a question “must be decided by a court, without \ndeference  to  the  agency.”  City  of  Arlington,  Tex.  v. \nFCC,  569  U.S.  290,  312  (2013)  (Roberts,  C.J., \ndissenting). Yet under the panel’s rule, a court would \nhave \nto  defer  when  an  appearing  sovereign \nrepresentative  asserts  its  power  to  interpret  foreign \nlaw.  That  approach  could  force  U.S.  courts  to  side \nwith  one  arm  of  a  foreign  sovereign  over  another  by \nhappenstance of which arm of the sovereign appears \nin  U.S.  court  first.

Rather  than  explaining  its \nfailures, \nthe \nmisrepresentation that Petitioners “never” raised the \nissue.  Ministry  Br.  10,  32.  Petitioners  raised  this \nprecise argument in response to Respondents’ motion \nto  dismiss:  “Defendants  have  offered  no  evidence  to \nshow  that  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  has  any  power \nunder Chinese law to interpret Chinese law, or, if it \nhas  such  power,  that  it  may  do  so  through  a \nlitigation  brief.”  Plaintiffs’  Mem.  in  Opposition  to \nMot.  to  Dismiss,  In  re  Vitamin  C.

Br. 28, they do not \nrequire binding deference.  \n\nthe  Second  Circuit’s  approach \n\n1.

The  District  Court \n\nApplied \n\nan \n\nAppropriate Deference Standard.  \n\nA.  The  District  Court  Granted  “Substantial \nthe  Ministry’s  Legal \n\nto \n\nDeference” \nSubmissions.  \n\n1.  The  District  Court’s  motion-to-dismiss  opinion \nappropriately  held  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  was \n“entitled  to  substantial  deference,  but  will  not  be \ntaken  as  conclusive  evidence  of  compulsion”  because \n“the  plain  language  of  the  documentary  evidence \nsubmitted  by  plaintiffs  directly  contradicts  the \nMinistry’s position.” Pet. App. 181a. \n\njudgment, \n\nAt  summary \n\nthe  District  Court \nreaffirmed this “substantial deference” standard and \nagain  rejected  Respondents’  argument  that  the \nMinistry’s  brief  was  entitled \n“conclusive” \ndeference.  Pet.  App.  95a-97a.  The  court  plainly  did \nnot  apply  a  “no”  or  “negative”  deference  standard—\nthe  court  deferred  to  certain  of  the  Ministry’s \nrepresentations. Pet. App. 118a-119a n37. \n\nto \n\n2. The parties agree that the Chinese authorities \non  which  the  Ministry  chiefly  relies  contain \nambiguous  provisions,  e.g.  JA98-106,  but  dispute",
        "14 \n\nhow  to  resolve  those  ambiguities.3  Respondents \nargue that these ambiguities compel deference to the \nMinistry’s  brief,  but  the  District  Court  held  that \nother  sources  also  warranted  attention.  Specifically, \nthe  court  weighed  the  pre-litigation  statements  and \nconduct  of  Respondents  and  Chinese  government \nofficials,  which  revealed  how  the  participants  in \nChina’s  regulatory  scheme  understood  the  system \nduring the relevant period. In doing so, the court did \nnot “embark[] on a solo mission,” Ministry Br. 16, or \nsubstitute its judgment for “those in the best position \nto  provide  direction,”  Resp.  Br.  47,  but  instead \ncontemporaneous  statements  and \ncredited \nactions  of  the  same  people  and  entities  it  is  now \naccused of disrespecting.  \n\nthe \n\nRespondents’  claim  that  the  District  Court  relied \non  its  “own  view”  of  the  “post-translation  ‘plain \nlanguage’” of the Ministry’s regulations, Resp. Br. 38, \nmisses the mark. The Ministry’s brief parsed much of \nthe same language that the District Court examined, \nPet. App. 202a-209a, and the District Court’s reading \nof  the  regulatory  texts  was  confirmed  by \nits \nexamination  of  contemporaneous  statements  by \n\n3  Respondents  again  claim  that  Petitioners  “concede[d]” \nthat price fixing was “mandatory” under the 2002 regime. Resp. \nBr.  13  &  n.8.  That  is  still  false.  Cert.  Reply  Br.  10  n.1. \nPetitioners’  statement  referred  to  a  heading  in  Respondents’ \nbrief,  and  the  surrounding  paragraphs  and  pages  make  clear \nthat  Petitioners  continued  to  argue  that  price-fixing  was  not \nmandatory, and that even Respondents’ position about Chinese \nlaw  would  not  absolve  them  of  liability.  See  generally  Br.  of \nPlaintiffs-Appellees,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,  No.  13-\n4791 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2014), ECF No. 174.",
        "15 \n\nthe  Chamber.  Further, \n\nRespondents  and \nthe \nMinistry  offered  official  translations  of  “notarized” \nChinese  regulations,  and  represented  that  they  had \nbeen  “certified”  by  a  “qualified  translation  agency.” \nPet.  App.  198a-200a  &  n.10.  At  minimum,  the \nDistrict Court was justified in relying on translations \nthat  the  Ministry  represented  as  authoritative  in  a \nsworn  declaration  by  its  U.S.  counsel.  See,  e.g.,  id.; \nDeclaration  of  Joel  M.  Mitnick,  In  re  Vitamin  C \nAntitrust  Litig.,  No.  06-md-1738  (E.D.N.Y.  June  29, \n2006), ECF No. 70. \n\n3.  The  application  of  “substantial  deference”  is \nfully consistent with considering the completeness of \na  foreign  sovereign’s  submission,  the  consistency  of \nthat  submission  with  underlying  legal  texts  or  prior \npublic  statements  by  the  sovereign,  or  other  sources \nthat  bear  upon  how  the  sovereign  understood  and \nimplemented  the  law  in  question.  U.S.  Br.  21.  This \nCourt  endorsed  such  an  approach  more  than  a \ncentury  ago  in  Fremont,  and  the  District  Court \nproperly followed it here. \n\nB.  The  Ministry’s  Brief  Was  Unworthy  of \n\nConclusive Weight.  \n\n1.  Applying  a  standard  of  substantial  deference, \nthe  District  Court  appropriately  declined  to  grant \nconclusive weight to the Ministry’s motion-to-dismiss \nphase  amicus  brief  because \nit  presented  an \nincomplete and misleading summary of Chinese law. \nThe  Ministry  claimed  to  “inform  the  Court  of  the \nregulatory  scheme  that  governed  defendants  during \nthe period encompassed by the Complaint,” Pet. App. \n191a,  but  its  brief  failed  in  that  task.  The  District \nCourt’s  decision  to  permit  further  discovery  was  not",
        "16 \n\n“profoundly  disrespectful,”  Ministry  Br.  2,  but \nappropriate given the record before it.  \n\nthe  brief  relied  extensively  on \n\n2.  The  Ministry’s  amicus  brief  failed  to  explain \nimportant  provisions  of  the  vitamin-C  regime.  For \nexample, \nthe \nMinistry’s 2002 PVC Notice, but did not acknowledge \nthe  existence  of  that  Notice’s  suspension  provision. \nPet.  Br.  15.  The  Ministry  now  claims \nthat \nRespondents could not invoke this provision on their \nown,  but  that  is  irrelevant.  The  question  was \nwhether  compliance  with  both  legal  regimes  was \nimpossible,  and  the  District  Court  reasonably \nobserved—in the absence of any interpretation of the \nprovision  by \nlaw \nprovided a mechanism that could have been invoked \nto  comply  with  U.S.  law.  Pet.  App.  97a,  124a. \nRespondents  now  say  that  this  provision  “was  not \ncontinued  in  the  2003  Announcement,”  Resp.  Br.  8, \nbut \nthe  2003 \nAnnouncement  was  meant  to  replace  the  2002 \nNotice,  and  the  Ministry  has  never  interpreted  it  in \nthat  way.  Finally,  Respondents  observe  that  the \nsuspension provision was never invoked, Resp. Br. 8, \nbut  that  conflicts  with  their  position  that  under  a \nface  of  China’s \n“true  conflict”  test \nit \nregulations,  not  how \nregulations  were \nimplemented, that matters, Resp. Br. 22, 54-56.  \n\nthe  Ministry—that  Chinese \n\nis  the \nthose \n\nindication \n\nis  no \n\nthere \n\nthat \n\nthat \n\n3.  The  Ministry’s  amicus  brief  affirmatively \nmisrepresented \n1997  Vitamin  C \nthe \nSubcommittee  Charter  was  operative  “[t]hroughout \nthe  relevant  period,”  Pet.  App.  202a,  and  repeatedly \ncited  provisions  of  the  1997  Charter  to  support  its \ncompulsion  theory  without  disclosing  that  those \nprovisions were obsolete for most of the class period,",
        "17 \n\nsee  Pet.  App.  204a-205a,  212a-213a.4  Not  one  of  the \nMinistry’s  three  submissions  to  the  District  Court \nmentioned  that  the  2002  Charter  repealed  and \nreplaced  the  1997  Charter.  Pet.  App.  132a  &  n.45; \nPet. App. 189a-223a; JA131-33; JA247-51.5 \n\nThe  Ministry  has  never  explained  why  it  did  not \ninform the District Court about the 2002 Charter. In \nthis Court, the Ministry argues that it distinguished \nbetween  the  1997  and  2002  regulatory  regimes, \nMinistry  Br.  28,  which  is  true  but  non-responsive—\nthe 2002 Charter was a pillar of the 2002 regime, but \nthe Ministry pretended it did not exist. In this Court, \nthe  Ministry  downplays  the  significance  of  the \nchanges  between  the  two  Charters,  Ministry  Br.  27-\n28, but the District Court cannot be held responsible \nfor explanations the Ministry did not offer. Pet. App. \n97a. \n\n4  Respondents  parroted  these  claims  at  the  motion-to-\ndismiss hearing. CAJA A606 (arguing that the 1997 Charter “is \nthe charter of this subcommittee,” and “only the members of the \nsubcommittee have the right to export Vitamin C”). \n\n5  The  District  Court  was  not  obliged  to  give  notice  that  it \nintended  to  rely  on  the  2002  Charter,  or  the  other  regulatory \nprovisions that contradicted the Ministry’s legal interpretation. \nResp.  Br.  49-50.  All  of  the  regulatory  materials  before  the \nDistrict  Court  were  submitted  by  the  Ministry  or  the  parties, \nincluding  the  2002  Charter,  and  the  Ministry  had  “more  than \nample opportunity to explain . . . Chinese law” when it chose in \n2009  “not  to  discuss,  or  cite  to,  any  specific  governmental \ndirectives.” Pet. App. 97a n.24.",
        "18 \n\nindustry \n\norganization \n\nThe  Subcommittee’s  mandate  changed  radically \nin  2002,  and  the  Ministry’s  contrary  claims  defy \nin  several \ncredulity.  The  regulations  diverge \nrespects:  first,  the  2002  Charter  departed  from  its \npredecessor  by  describing  the  Subcommittee  as  “a \njointly \nself-disciplinary \nestablished  on  a  voluntary  basis,”  JA182;  second, \nunlike  in  1997,  the  2002  Charter  did  not  require \nexporters  to  be  members  of  the  Subcommittee  and \ncontained  provisions  by  which  members  could \ninitiate  resignations6,  JA83-84,  186-187;  and  third, \nthe  2002  Charter  omitted  each  and  every  provision \nin  the  1997  Charter  that  purported  to  require \nChamber  members \nin  price-setting \nactivities,  compare  JA85,  with  JA182-199.  See  infra \n1a-3a. \n\nto  engage \n\nIn  response,  the  Ministry  cites  a  December  2001 \nresolution,  Ministry  Br.  28-29,  but  has  never \nexplained  how  that  resolution  interacted  with  the \n2002  Charter  provisions  that  abandoned  the  1997 \nCharter’s \nprovisions.  Separately, \nRespondents  claim  that  a  2003  Announcement \ntrumped  contrary  provisions  in  the  2002  Charter, \n\nprice-setting \n\n6 Respondents now claim for the first time that the right to \nresign  under  the  2002  Charter  could  not  be  invoked  because \nmembers  were  selected  to  four-year  terms.  Resp.  Br.  10.  That \nargument  was  not  made  below,  and  it  is  at  odds  with  Article \nEighteen of the Charter. JA187. Respondents also claim that it \nwould not have been “practical” for any member to resign, Resp. \nBr.  10,  but  the  pre-trial  affidavit  Respondents  cite  does  not \naddress the Charter’s specific resignation provision, and in any \nevent what the affiant believed was “practical” does not define \nwhat Chinese law required.",
        "19 \n\nResp.  Br.  8-9,  but  the  Ministry  did  not  offer  that \ninterpretation below so it could not have been a basis \nfor deference. In any event, the 2002 Charter was in \neffect for a year and a half of the class period before \nthe 2003 Announcement took effect. Compare JA182, \nwith JA102. \n\nC.  The  District  Court  Appropriately \nWeighed China’s Statements to the World \nTrade Organization.   \n\n1.  There  is  no  dispute  that  China  represented  to \nthe  WTO  that  it  “gave  up  export  administration  of \n. . .  vitamin  C”  as  of  January  1,  2002.  JA319.  The \nexplanations of this statement that Respondents and \nthe  Ministry  offer  this  Court  were  not  before  the \nDistrict  Court,  and  the  Second  Circuit  did  not  rely \nupon them. \n\n2.  The  Ministry  did  not  explain  China’s  WTO \nstatements before the District Court—when asked at \nthe motion-to-dismiss hearing, the Ministry’s counsel \noffered  no  response.  CAJA  A599-A630.  Through \nsummary  judgment,  the  Ministry  had  “ma[de]  no \nattempt  to  explain”  its  WTO  statements  in  any \nsubmission. Pet. App. 121a. Without any explanation \nfrom  the  Ministry,  the  District  Court  observed  that \nthe date on which China said it had given up “export \nadministration  of  vitamin  C”—January  1,  2002—\n“coincides  with  the  repeal,  on  January  1,  2002,  of” \nthe  1997  vitamin  C  export  regime  that  governed \nRespondents’  pre-2002  conduct,  Pet.  App.  123a,  and \nappropriately \nprior \nstatements  raised  doubts  about  the  accuracy  of  the \nMinistry’s amicus brief.  \n\nthat  China’s \n\nconcluded",
        "20 \n\n3.  Respondents  now  assert,  without  explanation, \nthat  the  PVC  system  only  ended  “non-automatic \nlicensing”  for  Chinese  vitamin  C  exports.  Resp.  Br. \n11-12,  40-41.  But  China  represented  that  it  had \nabandoned  “restrictions  on  exports  through  non-\nautomatic  licensing  or  other  means,”  Pet.  App.  74a \n(emphasis  added),  and  it  remains  unclear  why  the \nPVC  regime  was  not  an  export  restriction  through \n“other  means.”  The  Ministry  does  not  explain  how \nPVC  was  different  from  a  regime  of  non-automatic \nlicensing, or why China never published the vitamin-\nC PVC procedures in an “official journal” if they were \nintended  to  operate  as  an  export  restriction  under \nthe  WTO.  See  Br.  of  Donald  Clarke  and  Nicholas \nHowson  as  Amici  Curiae  in  Support  of  Petitioners \n11-17.  \n\n4.  Separately,  Respondents  and  the  Ministry \nhighlight  the  United  States’  submissions  in  the \nWTO’s  raw  materials  proceedings,  but  that  case \ninvolved a different record and legal standard. None \nof  the  extrinsic  materials  that  the  District  Court \nanalyzed were before the WTO panel. U.S. Br. 31 n. \n7.  And  the  U.S.  noted  that  its  assumptions  about \nChina’s export system had relied upon the Ministry’s \nrepresentations,  in  large  part  because  that  system \nwas  “non-transparent.”  First  Written  Submission  of \nthe United States, ¶¶ 205, 212, 215, 229. \n\nfilings  publicly  available  makes \n\nEven if this Court were inclined to weigh the U.S. \nraw  materials  submission,  China’s  refusal  to  make \nit \nits  WTO \nimpossible  to  know  whether  those  filings  were \nconsistent  with  its  amicus  brief.  There  is  reason  to \n(noting  China’s \nsuspect  otherwise.  See  JA728 \nargument  that  the  “2001  CCCMC  Charter  does  not",
        "21 \n\ncontain  either  imperative  or  authoritative  rules  of \nconduct”  under \nthe  WTO).  Further,  China’s \nsubmissions to the U.S. Commerce Department prior \nto  the  raw  materials  case  contradict  the  Ministry’s \nclaim that China still required “exporters to follow a \nprice-setting  regime.”  Ministry  Br.  31.  In  2004,  the \nMinistry  asserted—with \nlimited  exceptions  not \nincluding vitamin C—that in China price and output \ndecisions  were  based  on  market  considerations, \nJA241;  in  2007,  the  Ministry  declared  that  “[t]here \nare no State restrictions on price or output.” JA356.  \n\nIII.  The  Judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals \n\nShould Be Reversed.  \n\n1. This Court should reverse the Second Circuit’s \ncomity  decision  and  remand  for  further  proceedings \nconsistent  with  its  opinion  as  to  Respondents’ \nremaining  defenses.  At  minimum,  this  Court  should \nvacate  the \nfurther \njudgment  and  remand \nproceedings under the correct deference standard. \n\nfor \n\nThe  District  Court’s  failure  to  grant  conclusive \ndeference  to  the  Ministry’s  brief  was  the  sole \ndispositive  factor  requiring  reversal.  Pet.  App.  30a \nn.10;  Pet.  Br.  59.  If  the  District  Court  was  not \n“legally  bound”  to  accept  the  Ministry’s  brief,  then \nthe  panel’s  decision  rests  entirely  on  its  reading  of \nstage \nthe  District  Court’s  motion-to-dismiss \nconstruction of Chinese law, but that cursory review \nof  the  District  Court’s  preliminary  holding  cannot \nwithstand scrutiny. \n\n2.  Respondents  and  the  Ministry  argue  that  the \nMinistry’s \ninterpretation  was  so  patently \ncorrect  that  it  should  have  been  affirmed  under  any \nstandard  of  deference.  Not  so.  The  record  reveals  a \n\nlegal",
        "22 \n\nsystem  designed  to  stabilize  vitamin-C  export  prices \nand  avoid  anti-dumping  suits,  but  does  not  support \nthe  claim  that  Respondents  were  required  to  reach \nagreements  to  charge  supracompetitive  prices  and \nrestrict output. Pet. App. 139a-142a.  \n\na.  The  Ministry  and  Respondents  repeat  the \npanel’s  error  by  presuming  that  evidence  relating  to \nthe 2001 decision to enact the PVC regime was solely \nabout  the  motive  of  the  Chinese  Government.  Pet. \nApp. 30a-31a; Resp. Br. 54-55; Ministry Br. 26. That \ninquiry  was  aimed  at  the  Ministry’s  conduct,  not  its \nmotive. Pet.

The  contemporaneous  records  of  that \ncertain \nmeeting,  alongside  China’s \nregulations  and  representations \nthe  WTO, \nconvinced  the  District  Court  that  Respondents \nreached  that  agreement  voluntarily.  Pet.  App.  123a. \nIn  light  of  that  history,  and  Respondents’  long-\nrunning price war, JA108, the District Court credited \ncontemporaneous descriptions of the November 2001 \nmeeting, including that “persons within the industry \n[concluded]  that  the  enterprises  were  able  to  sit \ndown  together  at  this  particular  time  basically \nbecause  VC  prices  had  reached  rock  bottom,  and  no \none  could  sustain  a \nfurther  slide,”  and  that \nenterprises  “had  no  choice  but  to  seek  industry  self-\nregulation”  because  “the  country  had  opened  up  the \nfree \ncommercial  products  business, \nIn  other  words, \ncompetition  aspect,”  JA364. \nRespondents  agreed \nfix  prices  because  of \ngovernment deregulation, not compulsion. Id. \n\nfrom  a \n\nto",
        "23 \n\nb.  Respondents  and  the  Ministry,  citing  the \npanel’s  one-paragraph  discussion,  Pet.  App.  32a, \ndismiss  nearly  all  of  the  evidence  relating  to  class-\nperiod  conduct  as  irrelevant  evidence  of  “non-\nenforcement,”  Resp.  Br.  54-55;  Ministry  Br.  26  n.8. \nThat  argument  contradicts  China’s  position  in  the \nWTO  raw  materials  proceeding  that  “evidence \nshowing that exports of yellow phosphorous occurred \nbelow  the  minimum  export  price  demonstrates  that \nChina  did  not  maintain  a  minimum  export  price \nrequirement \nfor  yellow  phosphorous.”  Second \nWritten  Submission  of  the  United  States  ¶ 390. \n“non-\nFurther,  evidence  relating \nillustrated  how  the  Ministry  and \nenforcement” \nRespondents  understood  and \nthe \nregulatory regime.  \n\nimplemented \n\nto  so-called \n\nThe  District  Court  reviewed  the  regulations \nattached  to  the  Ministry’s  brief,  but  found  nothing \nthat  prohibited  exports  in  the  absence  of  industry \nprice  agreements.  Pet.  App.  132a.  The  Ministry  has \nnever explained what provision or concept of Chinese \nlaw  Respondents  violated  when  they  exported \nwithout  a  price  agreement.  This  gaping  regulatory \nhole  is  not  theoretical—for  significant  periods  before \nand during the class, the Chamber openly permitted \nexports with no price agreement in place. See JA398-\n400 (Vitamin-C had no agreed-upon export price “for \nthe  spring  of  2003”);  JA397  (“Each  company  can \nprovide  price  quote  based  on  its  own  judgment,  and \nno specific restraint or requirement is imposed.”); Ex. \n25  to  Declaration  of  Annabelle  Chan  in  Support  of \nDefendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  In  re \nVitamin C Antitrust Litig., No. 06-md-1738 (E.D.N.Y. \nNov.  23,  2009),  ECF  No.  394-5  at  41  (Respondents",
        "24 \n\n“unanimously agreed to nullify the export restrictive \nprice”  because  the  price  “at  US$5.1/kg  has  no \npractical meaning”).  \n\n3.  Respondents  and  the  Ministry  repeat  the \npanel’s  flawed  reasoning  that  because  the  Sherman \nAct  bars  all  price  coordination,  any  coordination \nmandate  would  make  compliance  with  the  Act \nimpossible.  Resp.  Br.  22;  Ministry  Br.  26;  Pet.  App. \n32a.  Antitrust  abstention  is  only  appropriate  when \n“compliance  with  the  laws  of  both  countries  is  .  .  . \nimpossible.” Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 \nU.S.  764,  799  (1993).  In  cases  involving  minimum \nprice floors, courts have rejected compulsion defenses \nwhere  defendants  have  agreed  to  depart  from  the \nmandated  floor.  E.g.  In  re  Japanese  Elec.  Prod. \nAntitrust  Litig.,  723  F.2d  238,  315  (3d  Cir.  1983), \nrev’d  on  other  grounds  sub  nom.  Matsushita  Elec. \nIndus. Co. Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \n598 (1986). That rule is eminently sensible—without \nit,  foreign  governments  could  immunize  companies \nfrom liability by mandating a coordinated price floor \nof $0.01 for every product.  \n\nthroughout \n\nRespondents  admit  that  pricing  was  left  “up  to \nthe  companies  so  long  as  they  exceeded  anti-\ndumping  minima.”  Resp.  Br.  10.  That  admission  is \nfatal,  because  the  alleged  anti-dumping  floor  was \n$3.35/kg \nyet \nthe \nRespondents  concede  that  they  frequently  agreed  to \nfix  prices  above  $3.35/kg.  CAJA  A2091-A2098. \nRespondents  could  have  declined  to  fix  prices  above \nthe  $3.35/kg  floor  consistent  with  both  the  Sherman \nAct  and  Chinese  law.  Thus,  it  was  improper  to \ndismiss  the  District  Court’s  findings  of  liability  on \nagreements that exceeded anti-dumping minima. \n\nperiod, \n\nclass",
        "25 \n\n Respondents  do  not  dispute  that  for  most  of  the \nclass  period,  the  Ministry  and  Chamber  abandoned \noutput  restrictions,  yet  Respondents  continued  to \nagree  upon  output  restraints  separate  from  their \nprice  agreements.  Pet.  Br.  11-12.  Price  fixing  and \noutput  restrictions  both  violate  the  Sherman  Act—\nunless  Chinese  law  compelled  both,  dismissal  was \nimproper. \n\n4.  Respondents  claim  that  Petitioners  never \nargued below that the remaining “comity abstention” \nfactors counseled against dismissal. Resp. Br. 56-57. \nBut  Petitioners  have  consistently  argued  that \ncomity-based abstention is appropriate only where a \n“true  conflict”  exists  between  U.S.  and  foreign  law, \nand  that  without  such  a  conflict,  dismissal  is \nimproper.  E.g.  Resp.  Br.  Ann.  A-2.  As  no  conflict \nexists, the remaining “comity abstention” factors are \nirrelevant.",

Etowah  Cnty.  Comm’n,  502 \nU.S. 491, 508 (1992), and the District Court was not \nrelieved  of  its  obligation  to  decide  the  questions  of \nforeign law before it because the Chinese Ministry of \nCommerce (“Ministry”) filed an amicus brief.  \n\nThe  District  Court  followed  a  well-trodden  path \nby  applying  a  “substantial  deference”  standard.  The \nUnited  States  endorsed  the  standard  fifteen  years \nago,  and  it  was  the  prevailing  approach  prior  to  the \ndecision  below.  A  substantial  deference  standard \nthe  completeness, \npermits  courts \nto  consider \nlegal \nof \nconsistency,  and  authority \nstatements,  and  it  is  consistent  with  principles  of \ninternational  comity  and  international  practice.  The \nrules  favored  by  the  Ministry  and  Respondents \nwould require deference to interpretations of foreign \nlaw that U.S. courts find inconclusive, inaccurate, or \neven  misleading.  Courts  can  and  will  benefit  from \nforeign  sovereigns  under  a \nthe  expertise  of \nsubstantial  deference  standard—there  is  no  reason \nto  resort  to  the  artificial  constraints  of  an  ill-\nconceived rule.   \n\nforeign \n\nThe  Ministry’s  warnings  of  diplomatic  chaos  ring \nhollow.  No  other  government  has  endorsed  the \nMinistry’s position. Instead, the Executive Branch—\nwhich unlike this Court has authority and expertise \nin matters of foreign relations—has appeared in this \nCourt \nsupporting  Petitioners  notwithstanding \nChina’s protests.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nThe  District  Court  appropriately  applied  a \n“substantial deference” standard that permitted it to \nconsider the thoroughness, consistency, and accuracy \nof the Ministry’s brief. The Ministry does not dispute \nthat  its  presentation  of  Chinese  law  was  incomplete \nand  inaccurate—it  repeatedly  cited  provisions  of  a \nrepealed  version  of  the  Vitamin-C  Subcommittee \nCharter  as  though  they  remained  in  force,  declined \nto  interpret  relevant  provisions  of  the  regulatory \nthe  District  Court  no \nscheme,  and  offered \nexplanation of its conflicting statements to the World \nTrade Organization (“WTO”).  \n\nThe District Court’s interpretation of Chinese law \nwas not “nonsensical”—and it was far more thorough \nthan  the  cursory  examination  on  which  the  Second \nCircuit  relied.  Following  its  accession  to  the  WTO, \nChina  sought  to  avoid  anti-dumping  penalties.  In \nthat  context,  the  requirement  that  the  Chamber \n“verify the submissions by the exporters based on the \nindustry  agreements,”  JA105,  made  perfect  sense \nalongside price agreements that were encouraged but \nnot  mandated.  Such  a  system  permitted  profitable \nexports  to  continue  when  agreements  could  not  be \nreached, but offered a mechanism for enforcing anti-\ndumping minima when agreements were achievable. \nFar  from  being  a  theoretical  construct  invented  by \nthe  District  Court,  the  record  showed  this  to  be  the \nactual  system  in  place  during  the  class  period,  and \nthe  agreements  for  which  Respondents  were  held \nliable were not required by it. Pet. Br. 10-11. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  The  Second  Circuit’s  Binding  Deference \n\nStandard Should Be Reversed.  \n\nA.  There  is  No  Legal  Support  for  a  Binding \n\nDeference Standard. \n\n1.  Petitioners  have  previously  explained  why  the \nSecond  Circuit’s \nconclusive \nrule  amounts \ndeference. Supp. Br. for Pet. 3-7. Respondents do not \ndefend the merits of a conclusive deference standard, \nbut  instead  endorse  a  “modest  holding”  that  directs \ncourts to “defer if reasonable.” Resp. Br. 20, 22. That \nis not what the panel held.  \n\nto \n\nthe \n\n“reasonable  under \n\na.  In  the  sentence  immediately  following  the \nphrase \ncircumstances \npresented,”  the  panel  explained  that  “[i]f  deference \nby  any  measure  is  to  mean  anything,  it  must  mean \nthat  a  U.S.  court  not  embark  on  a  challenge  to  a \nforeign  government’s  official  representation  to  the \ncourt regarding its laws or regulations. . . .” Pet. App. \n25a-26a.  The  Ministry  attempts  to  limit  the  court’s \n“do not challenge” command to inquiries based upon \nU.S.  legal  principles,  but  the  panel’s  interpretation \nwas  more  expansive.  Under  the  panel’s  test,  a  court \nmay  not  question  a  sovereign’s  representations  by \ncomparing  them  to  information  submitted  by  a  non-\nsovereign \nsovereign \nstatements,  or  information  discovered  by  the  court’s \nown  research.  Rather,  the  only  exception  is  where \n“no  documentary  evidence  or  reference  of  law  [is] \nproffered”  to  support  the  interpretation.  Pet.  App. \n25a  n.8.  That  approach  would  limit  Rule  44.1 \ninquiries  to  evaluating  the  reasonableness  of  the \nrepresentation on its face.  \n\nconflicting \n\nparty, \n\nprior \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 \n\nb.  The  rigidity  of  the  Second  Circuit’s  rule  is \nevident  from  its  reversal  of  the  District  Court’s \ndenial  of  Respondents’  motion  to  dismiss.  Pet.  App. \n2a n.2. The District Court’s only holding at that time \nwas  that  “the  record  as  it  stands  is  simply  too \nambiguous  to  foreclose  further  inquiry  into  the \nvoluntariness of defendants’ actions.” Pet. App. 186a. \nTo hold that the District Court abused its discretion \nby  permitting  discovery  must  mean  that  the  court \nlacked  authority  to  consider  materials  beyond  the \nMinistry’s brief. \n\nthat \n\nclaims \n\nThe  Ministry  now \n\nconclusive \ndeference  does  not  limit  a  court’s  discretion  to \nconsider  extrinsic  materials,  Ministry  Br.  25,  but \nsaid the opposite below. The Ministry argued that its \namicus  brief  required  the  District  Court  “to  ignore” \nPetitioners’  expert  testimony,  CAJA  A622,  and \nfurther  urged  that,  “unless  the  Court  makes  an \naffirmative  finding  that  it  finds  [the  Ministry’s] \npresentation  inherently  non-believable,  the  only \nproper  disposition  is  to  credit  the  government’s \nfinding and to foreclose an inquiry into what the law \nsays  and  other  findings,”  id.  (emphasis  added).  The \npanel ultimately adopted that view. \n\nare \n\nthat \n\nunpersuasive, \n\nc.  Even  with  Respondents’  gloss,  the  panel’s \nstandard  would  still  require  deference  to  legal \ninterpretations \nyet \nnonetheless  “reasonable  under  the  circumstances.” \nPet.  App.  25a.  Such  a  test  is  indistinguishable  from \nthe  standard  applied  under  Chevron.  But  the \nMinistry’s  brief  would  not  pass  muster  under  a \nChevron-like  rule,  Pet.  Br.  48-55,  and  there  is  no \nbasis  for  substituting  such  a  rule  for  the  discretion \nRule 44.1 contemplates. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f5 \n\nRespondents  and  the  Ministry  misapprehend  the \nimport  of  this  Court’s  cases  involving  deference  to \nadministrative  agencies.  Pet.  Br.  47-57.  This  Court \nhas  countenanced  standards  of  binding  deference \nbased  upon  an  implied  congressional  delegation  of \nrulemaking  authority  to  an  agency.  Even  in  that \ncontext there are substantial limits to deference that \nthe  Second  Circuit’s  rule  ignores,  id.  at  48-55,  and \noutside  that  context,  deference  is  not  required  even \nwhen an interpretation appears reasonable, id. at 54. \nthe  Ministry  offers  no  persuasive \nSimilarly, \njustification \nforeign  trade \nministry  receive  more  respect  than  the  highest \nranking  law-enforcement  official  of  a  U.S.  state.  Id. \nat 56-57. \n\ninsisting  that  a \n\nfor \n\n2.  There  is  no  place  for  a  conclusive  deference \nstandard  under  Rule  44.1.  Pet.  Br.  31-38.  While  the \nrule  permits  courts  to  “consider  any  relevant \nmaterial  or  source”  in  interpreting  foreign  law,  the \nSecond  Circuit  held  that  courts  may  not  rely  upon \nmaterials  beyond  the  four  corners  of  the  sovereign’s \nstatement.  In  holding  that  the  District  Court \ncommitted  legal  error  by  permitting  discovery  to \nproceed,  the  panel  held  that  all  of  the  materials \ndeveloped  during  discovery  and  trial  were  unworthy \nof  consideration.  Pet.  App.  2a  n.2,  30a.  A  court’s \ndiscretion  to  “decide  what  weight  is  to  be  given  to \ninformation  obtained  from  any  of  these  sources,” \nFremont v. United States, 58 U.S. (17 How.) 542, 557 \n(1855),  is  pointless  if  relying  upon  such  sources \nconstitutes reversible error.  \n\nContrary to the Ministry’s claim, Ministry Br. 11, \nthis  Court’s  decision  in  Fremont  did  not  grant \nconclusive  weight  to  any  legal  interpretation  offered \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f6 \n\nInstead, \n\ngovernment. \n\nthe  Mexican \n\nby \nthe \ninterpretation  of  Mexican  law  on  which  this  Court \nrelied was rendered in 1844, a decade before Fremont \nwas decided. Fremont, 58 U.S. (17 How.) at 561. And \nthe  interpretation  that  this  Court  accepted  was  a \npre-litigation  decision  by  Mexican  authorities  not  to \nenforce  procedures  that  Mexican  laws  purported  to \nrequire—in  other  words,  this  Court  held  that \nMexico’s  laws  as  written  should  be  read  in  light  of \nhow  Mexican  officials  had  implemented  them  in \npractice.  Id.  at  561-62.  Under  Fremont,  the  Second \nCircuit  erred  in  holding  that  the  District  Court \nshould  not  have  considered  pre-litigation  evidence \nrelating  to  enforcement,  including  the  Chamber’s \npractice  of  permitting  exports  that  did  not  comply \nwith  the  Ministry’s  interpretation  of  the  regulatory \nscheme. Pet. App. 32a.  \n\nThe  Ministry’s  consecutive \n\n“[n]ever  before” \ndeclarations,  Ministry  Br.  23,  misunderstand  U.S. \nlaw. Since the enactment of Rule 44.1, federal courts \nhave  thought  it  highly  “desirable”—and  necessary—\nto  review  questions  of  foreign  law  de  novo,  even \nwhere  foreign  sovereign  legal  interpretations  are \ninvolved.  E.g.  Riggs  Nat’l  Corp.  &  Subsidiaries  v. \nComm’r  of  Internal  Revenue  Serv.,  163  F.3d  1363, \n1368  (D.C.  Cir.  1999)  (“We  are  .  .  .  hesitant  to  treat \nan interpretation of law as an act of state, for such a \nview  might  be  in  tension  with  rules  of  procedure \ndirecting  U.S.  courts  to  conduct  a  de  novo  review  of \nforeign law when an issue of foreign law is raised.”). \n\n3.  Requiring  conclusive  deference  would  sacrifice \nthe  accuracy  of  foreign  law  determinations  by \nprivileging  the  identity  of  the  interpreter  above  the \ncontent of the interpretation. Pet. Br. 31-39. Reliance \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f7 \n\non a foreign sovereign’s legal statement may enhance \naccuracy  in  some  cases,  but  that  is  not  a  reason  to \nrequire  conclusive  deference  in  all  cases.  There  is \nalso  no  justification  for  a  rule  that  would  grant \nconclusive deference to an amicus brief submitted by \na foreign sovereign’s U.S. counsel, but not to a duly-\nenacted \nforeign  agency,  an \ninterpretive letter of a foreign minister, a decision of \na  foreign  court,  or  a  sworn  affidavit  of  a  non-\nappearing foreign official. Pet. App. 30a n.10.1 \n\nregulation  of  a \n\nincentives”  to  explain  their \n\nThe  Ministry  argues  that  foreign  governments \n“have  strong \nlaws \naccurately in U.S. courts, Ministry Br. 18, but those \nincentives  failed  to  keep  the  Ministry  honest  here, \ninfra at 15-19, and the incentive to protect domestic \nindustry is also powerful. Further, the consequences \nof  inaccuracy  are  different  when  the  interpretation \nconcerns  repealed \nlaws.  Unlike  the  “existing” \nRussian  law  interpreted  by  the  Commissariat  in \nUnited  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S.  203,  220  (1942),  the \nMinistry’s  interpretation  described  a  legal  regime \n\n1 The Ministry appears to believe that conclusive deference \napplies  only  when  sovereigns  appear  as  amici.  The  Ministry \nargues that multiple briefs filed by the Islamic Republic of Iran \nin  McKesson  HBOC,  Inc.  v.  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  271  F.3d \n1101  (D.C.  Cir.  2001),  did  not  receive  conclusive  deference \nbecause they did not offer an “official interpretation of Iranian \nlaw” (the Ministry ignores McKesson Corp. v. Islamic Republic \nof  Iran,  672  F.3d  1066  (D.C.  Cir.  2012)).  Ministry  Br.  14.  But \nthe Ministry’s only interpretation of Chinese law at the motion-\nto-dismiss  stage  was  its  amicus  brief  signed  by  U.S.  counsel, \nand that brief was no more “official” than the briefs Iran filed as \na party in McKesson. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f8 \n\nthat  Respondents  abandoned  after  Petitioners  filed \nsuit, Pet. Br 13. \n\nrule \n\n“clear” \n\ncould  be \n\n4.  The  Ministry  zigzags  between  defending  a \n“clear”  rule  of  conclusive  deference,  Ministry  Br.  22-\n23,  and  a  standard  that  permits  courts  to  “consider \nany  relevant  material”  and  defer  only  if  “reasonable \nunder the circumstances,” id. at 24. But the only way \nthe  Ministry’s \nis  by \ninappropriately  limiting  the  discretion  contemplated \nby Rule 44.1. Pet. Br. 27-39. A standard that applies \nonly  to  “reasonable”  interpretations,  Ministry  Br.  4, \nwould  be  hopelessly  indeterminate  absent  guidance \non  what  is  reasonable,  including  what  (if  any) \nextrinsic materials a court may consider when those \nmaterials  contradict  a  sovereign’s  amicus  brief.  In \nany  event,  Respondents  and  the  Ministry  cannot \ncredibly  oppose  “open-ended  balancing  tests”—the \ncomity  defense  they  would  have  this  Court  affirm  is \na meandering ten-factor test that offers no guidance \non  the  respective  weight  to  be  accorded  to  those \nfactors. See Pet. App. 220a-222a.  \n\nB.  United  States  v.  Pink  Does  Not  Support \nthe Second Circuit’s Deference Standard.  \n\n1.  Respondents  misleadingly  assert  that  “[t]his \nCourt  has  never  deviated  from  the  clear  rule  of \ndeference  established  in  Pink  more  than  75  years \nago,”  Resp.  Br.  25.  Pink  did  not  establish  a \nprospective  rule  of  deference,  let  alone  a  “clear  rule \nof  deference”  that  controls  this  case.  Pet.  Br.  40-41. \nThe  deference  owed  to  an  “official  declaration”  of  a \nforeign  sovereign  was  not  a  question  presented  in \nPink, and this Court did not analyze it. 315 U.S. 203, \n219  (1942).  Nor  did  this  Court  hold  that  legal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f9 \n\narguments  offered  by  a  foreign  ministry’s  amicus \nbrief,  absent  endorsement  of  the  Executive  Branch \nas  this  Court  credited  in  Pink,  ought  to  always  or \neven generally receive conclusive deference.  \n\nContrary  to  the  Ministry’s  claim,  Ministry  Br.  9, \nPink  did  not  hold  that  it  would  be  inappropriate  to \nconsider  “the  evidence  in  the  voluminous  record”  of \nthe  New  York  courts’  Moscow  Fire  cases  because  of \nthe  Commissariat’s  declaration,  Pink,  315  U.S.  at \n218.  This  Court  did  not  explain  why  it  declined  to \nreview  the  “voluminous”  record  before  the  referee, \n“except to note that the expert testimony tendered by \nits \nthe  United  States  gave  great  credence  to \nposition,” id., and there is no reason to presume that \nthis  Court  would  have  reached  the  same  result  had \nthe United States taken a contrary position. \n\n2.  Pink  illustrates  the  infirmity  of  a  conclusive \ndeference  rule.  Pet.  Br.  42-43.  The  Commissariat’s \n“power  to  interpret  existing  Russian  law”  was \nessential  to  this  Court’s  finding  that  its  declaration \nwas “conclusive.” Pink, 315 U.S. at 219. Respondents \nconcede  that  who  has  the  power  to  interpret  foreign \nlaw  is  a  question  of  foreign  law,  yet  do  not  explain \nhow  courts  should  decide  that  question.  Ordinarily, \nsuch a question “must be decided by a court, without \ndeference  to  the  agency.”  City  of  Arlington,  Tex.  v. \nFCC,  569  U.S.  290,  312  (2013)  (Roberts,  C.J., \ndissenting). Yet under the panel’s rule, a court would \nhave \nto  defer  when  an  appearing  sovereign \nrepresentative  asserts  its  power  to  interpret  foreign \nlaw.  That  approach  could  force  U.S.  courts  to  side \nwith  one  arm  of  a  foreign  sovereign  over  another  by \nhappenstance of which arm of the sovereign appears \nin  U.S.  court  first.  Cf.  Brief  for  the  Republic  of \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f10 \n\nHonduras as Amicus Curiae in Support of Petitioner, \nMcNab  v.

The Ministry never informed the District Court \nof  its  “unquestioned”  authority  to  interpret  Chinese \nlaw.  Pet.  Br.  42-43.  Rather  than  explaining  its \nfailures, \nthe \nmisrepresentation that Petitioners “never” raised the \nissue.  Ministry  Br.  10,  32.  Petitioners  raised  this \nprecise argument in response to Respondents’ motion \nto  dismiss:  “Defendants  have  offered  no  evidence  to \nshow  that  the  Ministry  of  Commerce  has  any  power \nunder Chinese law to interpret Chinese law, or, if it \nhas  such  power,  that  it  may  do  so  through  a \nlitigation  brief.”  Plaintiffs’  Mem.  in  Opposition  to \nMot.  to  Dismiss,  In  re  Vitamin  C.

The  Ministry  offered  no  response  until \nRespondents appealed—and even then did not claim \nits  authority  was  confirmed  by  China’s \nthat \ndiplomatic  note.2  Petitioners  agree  that  this  Court \nshould  not  “entertain  arguments  not  made  below,” \nMinistry Br. 10, but it is the Ministry’s claim to law-\ninterpreting authority that this Court should ignore.  \n\n2 Contrary to Respondents’ suggestion, Resp. Br. 3 n.1, the \ndiplomatic note does not assert that Chinese law delegates law-\ninterpreting authority to the Ministry. JA783.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f11 \n\nC.  Comity  Does  Not  Support  a  Binding \n\nDeference Standard.  \n\nWhile  principles  of  international  comity  counsel \n“respect  for  the  knowledge  that  foreign  sovereigns \nhave about their own law,” Resp. Br. 28, they do not \nrequire binding deference.  \n\nthe  Second  Circuit’s  approach \n\n1.  Neither  Respondents  nor  the  Ministry  dispute \nthat \nis  an \ninternational outlier—most of the world has rejected \nbinding  deference.  Br.  of  Professors  of  Conflict  of \nLaws  and  Civil  Procedure  at  19-25.  Nor  do \nRespondents  dispute  that  the  leading  international \ntreaties are at odds with the panel’s rule. The notion \nthat  a  theoretical  foreign  nation  could  adopt  a  more \nrigorous  rule,  Resp.  Br.  30,  is  farfetched—no  nation \nhas  done  so.  And  the  Ministry  has  not  represented \nthat Chinese courts would grant conclusive deference \nto  the  Justice  Department’s  interpretations  of  U.S. \nlaw.  \n\n2. Respondents and the Ministry are correct that \nthis  Court  should  avoid  “interference  with  the \ninternational  relations  prerogatives  of  the  political \nbranches,” Resp. Br. 33, but their prescription would \nreplace  the  traditional  judicial  role  with  diplomacy \nby fiat. The Executive Branch has communicated its \nand \nprerogatives \nnotwithstanding  China’s  vociferous  objections,  the \nUnited  States  has  urged  this  Court  to  vacate  the \ndecision  below  and  hold  that  binding  deference  is \ninappropriate. U.S. Br. 30-32.  \n\nregarding \n\ncase, \n\nthis \n\nThe  Ministry  appears  to  view  “respect”  as  a  one-\nway  street:  it  repeatedly  attacks  the  District  Court \nfor disrespecting Chinese sovereignty, Ministry Br. 2, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 \n\n5,  22,  while  in  the  same  breath  lecturing  the  U.S. \nExecutive and Judicial Branches on how to interpret \nand  apply  U.S.  law,  id.  3-6,  8-9,  20,  22-23.  In  any \nevent, courts should not decide cases based upon the \nperceived degree of offense taken by a foreign nation. \nSee Container Corp. of Am. v.

Hoffman-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran \nS.A.,  542  U.S.  155,  164-65  (2004).  This  case  was \nlimited  to  direct  sales  into  the  United  States  that \ninflated  prices,  and \nharmed  U.S.  victims  via \nconclusive \nsovereign \nto \nsubmissions  is  unnecessary  to  avoid  the  imprecise \napplication of U.S. law in such circumstances.  \n\ninterests  of \n\ndeference \n\nforeign \n\nfor \n\nFurther,  the  comity  doctrine  includes  numerous \nfactors  beyond  the  “true  conflict”  test  that  directly \ninterests.  See \naccount \nTimberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am., N.T. & S.A., \n549  F.2d  597,  614-15  (9th  Cir.  1977).  Under  the \nMinistry’s conclusive deference rule, these additional \nfactors would serve almost no purpose, and the “true \n\nsovereign \n\nforeign \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f13 \n\nconflict” test would become a reflection of the foreign \nsovereign’s  policy  interests  rather  than  an  accurate \nassessment of whether two legal regimes conflict.  \n\nII.  The  District  Court \n\nApplied \n\nan \n\nAppropriate Deference Standard.  \n\nA.  The  District  Court  Granted  “Substantial \nthe  Ministry’s  Legal \n\nto \n\nDeference” \nSubmissions.  \n\n1.  The  District  Court’s  motion-to-dismiss  opinion \nappropriately  held  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  was \n“entitled  to  substantial  deference,  but  will  not  be \ntaken  as  conclusive  evidence  of  compulsion”  because \n“the  plain  language  of  the  documentary  evidence \nsubmitted  by  plaintiffs  directly  contradicts  the \nMinistry’s position.” Pet. App. 181a. \n\njudgment, \n\nAt  summary \n\nthe  District  Court \nreaffirmed this “substantial deference” standard and \nagain  rejected  Respondents’  argument  that  the \nMinistry’s  brief  was  entitled \n“conclusive” \ndeference.  Pet.  App.  95a-97a.  The  court  plainly  did \nnot  apply  a  “no”  or  “negative”  deference  standard—\nthe  court  deferred  to  certain  of  the  Ministry’s \nrepresentations. Pet. App. 118a-119a n37. \n\nto \n\n2. The parties agree that the Chinese authorities \non  which  the  Ministry  chiefly  relies  contain \nambiguous  provisions,  e.g.  JA98-106,  but  dispute \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f14 \n\nhow  to  resolve  those  ambiguities.3  Respondents \nargue that these ambiguities compel deference to the \nMinistry’s  brief,  but  the  District  Court  held  that \nother  sources  also  warranted  attention.  Specifically, \nthe  court  weighed  the  pre-litigation  statements  and \nconduct  of  Respondents  and  Chinese  government \nofficials,  which  revealed  how  the  participants  in \nChina’s  regulatory  scheme  understood  the  system \nduring the relevant period. In doing so, the court did \nnot “embark[] on a solo mission,” Ministry Br. 16, or \nsubstitute its judgment for “those in the best position \nto  provide  direction,”  Resp.  Br.  47,  but  instead \ncontemporaneous  statements  and \ncredited \nactions  of  the  same  people  and  entities  it  is  now \naccused of disrespecting.  \n\nthe \n\nRespondents’  claim  that  the  District  Court  relied \non  its  “own  view”  of  the  “post-translation  ‘plain \nlanguage’” of the Ministry’s regulations, Resp. Br. 38, \nmisses the mark. The Ministry’s brief parsed much of \nthe same language that the District Court examined, \nPet. App. 202a-209a, and the District Court’s reading \nof  the  regulatory  texts  was  confirmed  by \nits \nexamination  of  contemporaneous  statements  by \n\n3  Respondents  again  claim  that  Petitioners  “concede[d]” \nthat price fixing was “mandatory” under the 2002 regime. Resp. \nBr.  13  &  n.8.  That  is  still  false.  Cert.  Reply  Br.  10  n.1. \nPetitioners’  statement  referred  to  a  heading  in  Respondents’ \nbrief,  and  the  surrounding  paragraphs  and  pages  make  clear \nthat  Petitioners  continued  to  argue  that  price-fixing  was  not \nmandatory, and that even Respondents’ position about Chinese \nlaw  would  not  absolve  them  of  liability.  See  generally  Br.  of \nPlaintiffs-Appellees,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust  Litig.,  No.  13-\n4791 (2d Cir. Aug. 11, 2014), ECF No. 174. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f15 \n\nthe  Chamber.  Further, \n\nRespondents  and \nthe \nMinistry  offered  official  translations  of  “notarized” \nChinese  regulations,  and  represented  that  they  had \nbeen  “certified”  by  a  “qualified  translation  agency.” \nPet.  App.  198a-200a  &  n.10.  At  minimum,  the \nDistrict Court was justified in relying on translations \nthat  the  Ministry  represented  as  authoritative  in  a \nsworn  declaration  by  its  U.S.  counsel.  See,  e.g.,  id.; \nDeclaration  of  Joel  M.  Mitnick,  In  re  Vitamin  C \nAntitrust  Litig.,  No.  06-md-1738  (E.D.N.Y.  June  29, \n2006), ECF No. 70. \n\n3.  The  application  of  “substantial  deference”  is \nfully consistent with considering the completeness of \na  foreign  sovereign’s  submission,  the  consistency  of \nthat  submission  with  underlying  legal  texts  or  prior \npublic  statements  by  the  sovereign,  or  other  sources \nthat  bear  upon  how  the  sovereign  understood  and \nimplemented  the  law  in  question.  U.S.  Br.  21.  This \nCourt  endorsed  such  an  approach  more  than  a \ncentury  ago  in  Fremont,  and  the  District  Court \nproperly followed it here. \n\nB.  The  Ministry’s  Brief  Was  Unworthy  of \n\nConclusive Weight.  \n\n1.  Applying  a  standard  of  substantial  deference, \nthe  District  Court  appropriately  declined  to  grant \nconclusive weight to the Ministry’s motion-to-dismiss \nphase  amicus  brief  because \nit  presented  an \nincomplete and misleading summary of Chinese law. \nThe  Ministry  claimed  to  “inform  the  Court  of  the \nregulatory  scheme  that  governed  defendants  during \nthe period encompassed by the Complaint,” Pet. App. \n191a,  but  its  brief  failed  in  that  task.  The  District \nCourt’s  decision  to  permit  further  discovery  was  not \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f16 \n\n“profoundly  disrespectful,”  Ministry  Br.  2,  but \nappropriate given the record before it.  \n\nthe  brief  relied  extensively  on \n\n2.  The  Ministry’s  amicus  brief  failed  to  explain \nimportant  provisions  of  the  vitamin-C  regime.  For \nexample, \nthe \nMinistry’s 2002 PVC Notice, but did not acknowledge \nthe  existence  of  that  Notice’s  suspension  provision. \nPet.  Br.  15.  The  Ministry  now  claims \nthat \nRespondents could not invoke this provision on their \nown,  but  that  is  irrelevant.  The  question  was \nwhether  compliance  with  both  legal  regimes  was \nimpossible,  and  the  District  Court  reasonably \nobserved—in the absence of any interpretation of the \nprovision  by \nlaw \nprovided a mechanism that could have been invoked \nto  comply  with  U.S.  law.  Pet.  App.  97a,  124a. \nRespondents  now  say  that  this  provision  “was  not \ncontinued  in  the  2003  Announcement,”  Resp.  Br.  8, \nbut \nthe  2003 \nAnnouncement  was  meant  to  replace  the  2002 \nNotice,  and  the  Ministry  has  never  interpreted  it  in \nthat  way.  Finally,  Respondents  observe  that  the \nsuspension provision was never invoked, Resp. Br. 8, \nbut  that  conflicts  with  their  position  that  under  a \nface  of  China’s \n“true  conflict”  test \nit \nregulations,  not  how \nregulations  were \nimplemented, that matters, Resp. Br. 22, 54-56.  \n\nthe  Ministry—that  Chinese \n\nis  the \nthose \n\nindication \n\nis  no \n\nthere \n\nthat \n\nthat \n\n3.

App.  202a,  and  repeatedly \ncited  provisions  of  the  1997  Charter  to  support  its \ncompulsion  theory  without  disclosing  that  those \nprovisions were obsolete for most of the class period, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f17 \n\nsee  Pet.  App.  204a-205a,  212a-213a.4  Not  one  of  the \nMinistry’s  three  submissions  to  the  District  Court \nmentioned  that  the  2002  Charter  repealed  and \nreplaced  the  1997  Charter.  Pet.  App.  132a  &  n.45; \nPet. App. 189a-223a; JA131-33; JA247-51.5 \n\nThe  Ministry  has  never  explained  why  it  did  not \ninform the District Court about the 2002 Charter. In \nthis Court, the Ministry argues that it distinguished \nbetween  the  1997  and  2002  regulatory  regimes, \nMinistry  Br.  28,  which  is  true  but  non-responsive—\nthe 2002 Charter was a pillar of the 2002 regime, but \nthe Ministry pretended it did not exist. In this Court, \nthe  Ministry  downplays  the  significance  of  the \nchanges  between  the  two  Charters,  Ministry  Br.  27-\n28, but the District Court cannot be held responsible \nfor explanations the Ministry did not offer. Pet. App. \n97a. \n\n4  Respondents  parroted  these  claims  at  the  motion-to-\ndismiss hearing. CAJA A606 (arguing that the 1997 Charter “is \nthe charter of this subcommittee,” and “only the members of the \nsubcommittee have the right to export Vitamin C”). \n\n5  The  District  Court  was  not  obliged  to  give  notice  that  it \nintended  to  rely  on  the  2002  Charter,  or  the  other  regulatory \nprovisions that contradicted the Ministry’s legal interpretation. \nResp.  Br.  49-50.  All  of  the  regulatory  materials  before  the \nDistrict  Court  were  submitted  by  the  Ministry  or  the  parties, \nincluding  the  2002  Charter,  and  the  Ministry  had  “more  than \nample opportunity to explain . . . Chinese law” when it chose in \n2009  “not  to  discuss,  or  cite  to,  any  specific  governmental \ndirectives.” Pet. App. 97a n.24.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n \n\f18 \n\nindustry \n\norganization \n\nThe  Subcommittee’s  mandate  changed  radically \nin  2002,  and  the  Ministry’s  contrary  claims  defy \nin  several \ncredulity.  The  regulations  diverge \nrespects:  first,  the  2002  Charter  departed  from  its \npredecessor  by  describing  the  Subcommittee  as  “a \njointly \nself-disciplinary \nestablished  on  a  voluntary  basis,”  JA182;  second, \nunlike  in  1997,  the  2002  Charter  did  not  require \nexporters  to  be  members  of  the  Subcommittee  and \ncontained  provisions  by  which  members  could \ninitiate  resignations6,  JA83-84,  186-187;  and  third, \nthe  2002  Charter  omitted  each  and  every  provision \nin  the  1997  Charter  that  purported  to  require \nChamber  members \nin  price-setting \nactivities,  compare  JA85,  with  JA182-199.  See  infra \n1a-3a. \n\nto  engage \n\nIn  response,  the  Ministry  cites  a  December  2001 \nresolution,  Ministry  Br.  28-29,  but  has  never \nexplained  how  that  resolution  interacted  with  the \n2002  Charter  provisions  that  abandoned  the  1997 \nCharter’s \nprovisions.  Separately, \nRespondents  claim  that  a  2003  Announcement \ntrumped  contrary  provisions  in  the  2002  Charter, \n\nprice-setting \n\n6 Respondents now claim for the first time that the right to \nresign  under  the  2002  Charter  could  not  be  invoked  because \nmembers  were  selected  to  four-year  terms.  Resp.  Br.  10.  That \nargument  was  not  made  below,  and  it  is  at  odds  with  Article \nEighteen of the Charter. JA187. Respondents also claim that it \nwould not have been “practical” for any member to resign, Resp. \nBr.  10,  but  the  pre-trial  affidavit  Respondents  cite  does  not \naddress the Charter’s specific resignation provision, and in any \nevent what the affiant believed was “practical” does not define \nwhat Chinese law required.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                            \n\f19 \n\nResp.  Br.  8-9,  but  the  Ministry  did  not  offer  that \ninterpretation below so it could not have been a basis \nfor deference. In any event, the 2002 Charter was in \neffect for a year and a half of the class period before \nthe 2003 Announcement took effect. Compare JA182, \nwith JA102. \n\nC.  The  District  Court  Appropriately \nWeighed China’s Statements to the World \nTrade Organization.   \n\n1.  There  is  no  dispute  that  China  represented  to \nthe  WTO  that  it  “gave  up  export  administration  of \n. . .  vitamin  C”  as  of  January  1,  2002.  JA319.  The \nexplanations of this statement that Respondents and \nthe  Ministry  offer  this  Court  were  not  before  the \nDistrict  Court,  and  the  Second  Circuit  did  not  rely \nupon them. \n\n2.  The  Ministry  did  not  explain  China’s  WTO \nstatements before the District Court—when asked at \nthe motion-to-dismiss hearing, the Ministry’s counsel \noffered  no  response.  CAJA  A599-A630.  Through \nsummary  judgment,  the  Ministry  had  “ma[de]  no \nattempt  to  explain”  its  WTO  statements  in  any \nsubmission. Pet. App. 121a. Without any explanation \nfrom  the  Ministry,  the  District  Court  observed  that \nthe date on which China said it had given up “export \nadministration  of  vitamin  C”—January  1,  2002—\n“coincides  with  the  repeal,  on  January  1,  2002,  of” \nthe  1997  vitamin  C  export  regime  that  governed \nRespondents’  pre-2002  conduct,  Pet.  App.  123a,  and \nappropriately \nprior \nstatements  raised  doubts  about  the  accuracy  of  the \nMinistry’s amicus brief.  \n\nthat  China’s \n\nconcluded \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 \n\n3.  Respondents  now  assert,  without  explanation, \nthat  the  PVC  system  only  ended  “non-automatic \nlicensing”  for  Chinese  vitamin  C  exports.  Resp.  Br. \n11-12,  40-41.  But  China  represented  that  it  had \nabandoned  “restrictions  on  exports  through  non-\nautomatic  licensing  or  other  means,”  Pet.  App.  74a \n(emphasis  added),  and  it  remains  unclear  why  the \nPVC  regime  was  not  an  export  restriction  through \n“other  means.”  The  Ministry  does  not  explain  how \nPVC  was  different  from  a  regime  of  non-automatic \nlicensing, or why China never published the vitamin-\nC PVC procedures in an “official journal” if they were \nintended  to  operate  as  an  export  restriction  under \nthe  WTO.  See  Br.  of  Donald  Clarke  and  Nicholas \nHowson  as  Amici  Curiae  in  Support  of  Petitioners \n11-17.  \n\n4.  Separately,  Respondents  and  the  Ministry \nhighlight  the  United  States’  submissions  in  the \nWTO’s  raw  materials  proceedings,  but  that  case \ninvolved a different record and legal standard. None \nof  the  extrinsic  materials  that  the  District  Court \nanalyzed were before the WTO panel. U.S. Br. 31 n. \n7.  And  the  U.S.  noted  that  its  assumptions  about \nChina’s export system had relied upon the Ministry’s \nrepresentations,  in  large  part  because  that  system \nwas  “non-transparent.”  First  Written  Submission  of \nthe United States, ¶¶ 205, 212, 215, 229. \n\nfilings  publicly  available  makes \n\nEven if this Court were inclined to weigh the U.S. \nraw  materials  submission,  China’s  refusal  to  make \nit \nits  WTO \nimpossible  to  know  whether  those  filings  were \nconsistent  with  its  amicus  brief.  There  is  reason  to \n(noting  China’s \nsuspect  otherwise.  See  JA728 \nargument  that  the  “2001  CCCMC  Charter  does  not \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f21 \n\ncontain  either  imperative  or  authoritative  rules  of \nconduct”  under \nthe  WTO).  Further,  China’s \nsubmissions to the U.S. Commerce Department prior \nto  the  raw  materials  case  contradict  the  Ministry’s \nclaim that China still required “exporters to follow a \nprice-setting  regime.”  Ministry  Br.  31.  In  2004,  the \nMinistry  asserted—with \nlimited  exceptions  not \nincluding vitamin C—that in China price and output \ndecisions  were  based  on  market  considerations, \nJA241;  in  2007,  the  Ministry  declared  that  “[t]here \nare no State restrictions on price or output.” JA356.  \n\nIII.  The  Judgment  of  the  Court  of  Appeals \n\nShould Be Reversed.  \n\n1. This Court should reverse the Second Circuit’s \ncomity  decision  and  remand  for  further  proceedings \nconsistent  with  its  opinion  as  to  Respondents’ \nremaining  defenses.  At  minimum,  this  Court  should \nvacate  the \nfurther \njudgment  and  remand \nproceedings under the correct deference standard. \n\nfor \n\nThe  District  Court’s  failure  to  grant  conclusive \ndeference  to  the  Ministry’s  brief  was  the  sole \ndispositive  factor  requiring  reversal.  Pet.  App.  30a \nn.10;  Pet.  Br.  59.  If  the  District  Court  was  not \n“legally  bound”  to  accept  the  Ministry’s  brief,  then \nthe  panel’s  decision  rests  entirely  on  its  reading  of \nstage \nthe  District  Court’s  motion-to-dismiss \nconstruction of Chinese law, but that cursory review \nof  the  District  Court’s  preliminary  holding  cannot \nwithstand scrutiny. \n\n2.  Respondents  and  the  Ministry  argue  that  the \nMinistry’s \ninterpretation  was  so  patently \ncorrect  that  it  should  have  been  affirmed  under  any \nstandard  of  deference.  Not  so.  The  record  reveals  a \n\nlegal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f22 \n\nsystem  designed  to  stabilize  vitamin-C  export  prices \nand  avoid  anti-dumping  suits,  but  does  not  support \nthe  claim  that  Respondents  were  required  to  reach \nagreements  to  charge  supracompetitive  prices  and \nrestrict output. Pet. App. 139a-142a.  \n\na.  The  Ministry  and  Respondents  repeat  the \npanel’s  error  by  presuming  that  evidence  relating  to \nthe 2001 decision to enact the PVC regime was solely \nabout  the  motive  of  the  Chinese  Government.  Pet. \nApp. 30a-31a; Resp. Br. 54-55; Ministry Br. 26. That \ninquiry  was  aimed  at  the  Ministry’s  conduct,  not  its \nmotive. Pet. App. 185a-186a.  \n\nrepeal  of \nto \n\nThe  PVC  system  did  not  exist  in  November  2001 \nwhen  Respondents  agreed  to  raise  prices  to  $3/kg. \nPet.  Br.  7.  The  contemporaneous  records  of  that \ncertain \nmeeting,  alongside  China’s \nregulations  and  representations \nthe  WTO, \nconvinced  the  District  Court  that  Respondents \nreached  that  agreement  voluntarily.  Pet.  App.  123a. \nIn  light  of  that  history,  and  Respondents’  long-\nrunning price war, JA108, the District Court credited \ncontemporaneous descriptions of the November 2001 \nmeeting, including that “persons within the industry \n[concluded]  that  the  enterprises  were  able  to  sit \ndown  together  at  this  particular  time  basically \nbecause  VC  prices  had  reached  rock  bottom,  and  no \none  could  sustain  a \nfurther  slide,”  and  that \nenterprises  “had  no  choice  but  to  seek  industry  self-\nregulation”  because  “the  country  had  opened  up  the \nfree \ncommercial  products  business, \nIn  other  words, \ncompetition  aspect,”  JA364. \nRespondents  agreed \nfix  prices  because  of \ngovernment deregulation, not compulsion. Id. \n\nfrom  a \n\nto \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f23 \n\nb.  Respondents  and  the  Ministry,  citing  the \npanel’s  one-paragraph  discussion,  Pet.  App.  32a, \ndismiss  nearly  all  of  the  evidence  relating  to  class-\nperiod  conduct  as  irrelevant  evidence  of  “non-\nenforcement,”  Resp.  Br.  54-55;  Ministry  Br.  26  n.8. \nThat  argument  contradicts  China’s  position  in  the \nWTO  raw  materials  proceeding  that  “evidence \nshowing that exports of yellow phosphorous occurred \nbelow  the  minimum  export  price  demonstrates  that \nChina  did  not  maintain  a  minimum  export  price \nrequirement \nfor  yellow  phosphorous.”  Second \nWritten  Submission  of  the  United  States  ¶ 390. \n“non-\nFurther,  evidence  relating \nillustrated  how  the  Ministry  and \nenforcement” \nRespondents  understood  and \nthe \nregulatory regime.  \n\nimplemented \n\nto  so-called \n\nThe  District  Court  reviewed  the  regulations \nattached  to  the  Ministry’s  brief,  but  found  nothing \nthat  prohibited  exports  in  the  absence  of  industry \nprice  agreements.  Pet.  App.  132a.  The  Ministry  has \nnever explained what provision or concept of Chinese \nlaw  Respondents  violated  when  they  exported \nwithout  a  price  agreement.  This  gaping  regulatory \nhole  is  not  theoretical—for  significant  periods  before \nand during the class, the Chamber openly permitted \nexports with no price agreement in place. See JA398-\n400 (Vitamin-C had no agreed-upon export price “for \nthe  spring  of  2003”);  JA397  (“Each  company  can \nprovide  price  quote  based  on  its  own  judgment,  and \nno specific restraint or requirement is imposed.”); Ex. \n25  to  Declaration  of  Annabelle  Chan  in  Support  of \nDefendants’  Motion  for  Summary  Judgment,  In  re \nVitamin C Antitrust Litig., No. 06-md-1738 (E.D.N.Y. \nNov.  23,  2009),  ECF  No.  394-5  at  41  (Respondents \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f24 \n\n“unanimously agreed to nullify the export restrictive \nprice”  because  the  price  “at  US$5.1/kg  has  no \npractical meaning”).  \n\n3.  Respondents  and  the  Ministry  repeat  the \npanel’s  flawed  reasoning  that  because  the  Sherman \nAct  bars  all  price  coordination,  any  coordination \nmandate  would  make  compliance  with  the  Act \nimpossible.  Resp.  Br.  22;  Ministry  Br.  26;  Pet.  App. \n32a.  Antitrust  abstention  is  only  appropriate  when \n“compliance  with  the  laws  of  both  countries  is  .  .  . \nimpossible.” Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 \nU.S.  764,  799  (1993).  In  cases  involving  minimum \nprice floors, courts have rejected compulsion defenses \nwhere  defendants  have  agreed  to  depart  from  the \nmandated  floor.  E.g.  In  re  Japanese  Elec.  Prod. \nAntitrust  Litig.,  723  F.2d  238,  315  (3d  Cir.  1983), \nrev’d  on  other  grounds  sub  nom.  Matsushita  Elec. \nIndus. Co. Ltd. v. Zenith Radio Corp., 475 U.S. 574, \n598 (1986). That rule is eminently sensible—without \nit,  foreign  governments  could  immunize  companies \nfrom liability by mandating a coordinated price floor \nof $0.01 for every product.  \n\nthroughout \n\nRespondents  admit  that  pricing  was  left  “up  to \nthe  companies  so  long  as  they  exceeded  anti-\ndumping  minima.”  Resp.  Br.  10.  That  admission  is \nfatal,  because  the  alleged  anti-dumping  floor  was \n$3.35/kg \nyet \nthe \nRespondents  concede  that  they  frequently  agreed  to \nfix  prices  above  $3.35/kg.  CAJA  A2091-A2098. \nRespondents  could  have  declined  to  fix  prices  above \nthe  $3.35/kg  floor  consistent  with  both  the  Sherman \nAct  and  Chinese  law.  Thus,  it  was  improper  to \ndismiss  the  District  Court’s  findings  of  liability  on \nagreements that exceeded anti-dumping minima. \n\nperiod, \n\nclass \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f25 \n\n Respondents  do  not  dispute  that  for  most  of  the \nclass  period,  the  Ministry  and  Chamber  abandoned \noutput  restrictions,  yet  Respondents  continued  to \nagree  upon  output  restraints  separate  from  their \nprice  agreements.  Pet.  Br.  11-12.  Price  fixing  and \noutput  restrictions  both  violate  the  Sherman  Act—\nunless  Chinese  law  compelled  both,  dismissal  was \nimproper. \n\n4.  Respondents  claim  that  Petitioners  never \nargued below that the remaining “comity abstention” \nfactors counseled against dismissal. Resp. Br. 56-57. \nBut  Petitioners  have  consistently  argued  that \ncomity-based abstention is appropriate only where a \n“true  conflict”  exists  between  U.S.  and  foreign  law, \nand  that  without  such  a  conflict,  dismissal  is \nimproper.  E.g.  Resp.  Br.  Ann.  A-2.  As  no  conflict \nexists, the remaining “comity abstention” factors are \nirrelevant.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f26 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe Second Circuit’s judgment should be \n\nreversed. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nMICHAEL J.
