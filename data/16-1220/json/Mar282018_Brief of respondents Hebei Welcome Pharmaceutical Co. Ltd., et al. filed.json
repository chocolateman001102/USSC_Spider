        "1 \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nA.  Introduction \n\nChinese  law  compelled  price-fixing  of  Vitamin \nC throughout the relevant period.  That was not only \nthe  conclusion  of  the  court  of  appeals  below.    In  a \nclosely related matter, the World Trade Organization \n(“WTO”),  agreeing  with  the  United  States,  Europe, \nand Mexico, confirmed that “China require[d] export-\ning enterprises to export at set or coordinated export \nprices or otherwise face penalties.”  Chinese law thus \nconflicted directly with the Sherman Act. \n\nIn  this  litigation,  for  the  first  time  in  history, \nChina appeared before an American court as an ami-\ncus curiae.  It did so to describe what was required of \nVitamin  C  manufacturers  under  its  regulatory  sys-\ntem.    China  explained  logically  how  its  regime  com-\nmanded companies to reach coordinated export prices \nas  a  group,  without  the  need  for  the  government  to \ndictate specific prices.  But instead of the respect this \nCourt  has  required  of  the  formal  submissions  of  for-\neign  governments,  the  district  court  effectively  ac-\ncused  China  of  misrepresenting its  system  to  protect \nits  nationals,  based  largely  on  its  plainly  erroneous \nview  that  China’s  representations  to  the  WTO  were \ninconsistent with its submissions in this case.  Reject-\ning China’s statements, the district court interpreted \nthe governing regulations in a way that rendered the \nprovisions incoherent and unworkable.     \n\nThe  court  of  appeals,  properly  exercising  de \nnovo  review,  analyzed  China’s  submissions  and  the \napplicable  regulations.  It  determined  that  China’s \nanalysis was reasonable and reliable, and established \nthat China compelled conduct that conflicted with the \nSherman Act.",
        "2 \n\nHaving  found  China’s  formal  submissions  to \nhave  been  reasonable,  the  court  held  that  that  the \ndistrict  court  had  erred  by  not  giving  those  submis-\nsions  decisive  weight.    This  “defer  if  reasonable” \nstandard is not a standard of conclusive deference di-\nvorced  from  a  careful  analysis  of  the  foreign  govern-\nment’s submissions.  It is, rather, a standard entirely \nconsistent  with  the  decisions  of  this  Court.  The  deci-\nsion below should be affirmed. \n\nB.  Statement of Facts \n\n1.  From  October  1949,  when  Chairman  Mao \nZedong announced the creation of the People’s Repub-\nlic  of  China,  through  1978,  China  had  a  “command \neconomy.”  Under that system, the State, directed by \nthe Communist Party, operated the significant indus-\ntrial  assets  in  the  economy.    JA137,  142.    In  1978, \nhowever,  under  the  leadership  of  Deng  Xiaoping, \nChina  began  a  transition  into  a  “socialist  market \neconomy,”  under  which  greater  private  ownership \nwas  permitted,  subject  to  a  variety  of  governmental \ncontrols.  Pet. App. 58a-59a; JA139, 142, 171. \n\nThe  transition  to  a  “socialist”  market  economy \nwas  gradual,  reflecting  as  it  did  a  cultural  change.  \nThe  details  of  the  transition  were  not  embodied  in \nspecific statutes and regulations because Chinese law \ndoes  not  work  that  way.

The  governing  agency  controlling  China’s \nexport trade is known today as the Ministry of Com-\nmerce  (sometimes  called  MOFCOM).  The  Ministry’s \norigins  date  back  to  1949,  when  China  established \nthe  Ministry  of  Trade.    JA142.    From  1993  to  2003, \nthe  Ministry  was  referred  to  as  the  Ministry  of  For-\neign  Trade  and  Economic  Co-operation  (“MOFTEC”).  \nIt  was  renamed  MOFCOM  in  2003  following  a  reor-\nganization.  \n\nThe  Ministry  is  a  component  of  the  State \nCouncil  (China’s  central  government)  and  “the  high-\nest authority in China authorized to regulate foreign \ntrade.”    Pet.  App.  57a;  JA141  &  n.1.    “It  has  the  au-\nthority  to  draft  and  implement  trade-related  laws, \nregulations,  policies  and  directives.

Br.  42)  and  amici  Clarke \nand Howson (Br. 17-22) that the Ministry lacks authority to in-\nterpret Chinese law lacks any basis.  China sent the U.S. State \nDepartment  a  diplomatic  note  that  confirms  the  Ministry’s  au-\nthority.

        "4 \n\nSince 1989, the Ministry has regulated the ex-\nport  of  Vitamin  C  and  other  medicinal  products \nthrough the Chamber of Commerce of Medicines and \nHealth  Products  Importers  &  Exporters  (“the  Cham-\nber”).    CAJA685.  The  Chamber  is  called  a “social  or-\nganization,” but that English translation of a Chinese \nterm  of  art  can  be  deceptive.  It  exercises  delegated \nregulatory power and acts as an arm of the Ministry.  \nSee  CAJA747,  3715-17;  Pet.  App.  72a-73a,  118a-19a \nn.37.  At all relevant times, its function was to “coor-\ndinate  import  and  export  business  in  Chinese  and \nWestern  medicines”  by  implementing  government \npolicies  and  regulations under  “the  guidance  and  su-\npervision  of  the  responsible  departments  under  the \nStat[e]  Council.”    CAJA412  (Chamber  statement, \n2003).  “Coordinating price, market and clients of for-\neign trade” were among these responsibilities. Id.   \n\nThe  Chamber is  one  of  several  chambers  over-\nseen  by  the  Ministry.    As  the  United  States  has  ex-\nplained, “China’s Chambers of Commerce are organi-\nzations representing private members that also func-\ntion  as  entities  under  MOFCOM’s  direct  and  active \nsupervision  and,  accordingly,  play  a  central  role  in \nregulating  the  trade  of  China’s  industries.”    First \nWritten Submission of the United States of America, \nChina – Measures Related to the Exportation of Vari-\nous  Raw  Materials,  WT/DS394,  WT/DS395, \nWT/DS398  ¶  207  (June  1,  2010),  available  at \ngoo.gl/sxyv43 (“US-WTO Submission”). \n\n3.  In 1997, the Ministry instituted a regulato-\nry system for the production and export of Vitamin C. \nIn conjunction with the State Drug Administration, it \nissued  the  “1997  Notice,”  JA89-97,  under  which  Vit-\namin  C  production  was  to  be  “strictly  controlled.”  \nJA90.   Under  the  Notice,  the  Chamber  was  to  estab-",

The  Subcommittee \nwas  a  branch  of  the  Chamber,  not  a  separate  entity.  \nJA80.    Its  main  responsibilities  were  “to  coordinate \nwith  respect  to  Vitamin  C  export  market,  price  and \ncustomers.”  JA92.  Its members were the four major \nChinese  Vitamin  C  manufacturers,  Northeast    Phar-\nmaceutical  Group  Co.,  Ltd.,  Jiangsu  Jiangshan \nPharmaceutical  Co.  Ltd.,  Weisheng  Pharmaceutical \nCo.  Ltd.,  and  Respondent  Hebei  Welcome  Pharma-\nceutical  Co.,  Ltd.  (“Welcome”),  JA422,  and  it  was \nchaired by an officer of the Chamber, Mr. Qiao Haili.  \nThe  four  companies  were  all  required  to  participate \nin  the  Subcommittee  “and  subject  themselves  to  the \ncoordination of the Group.”  JA92.2 \n\nThe Subcommittee’s 1997 charter conformed to \nthe  Ministry’s  directive.    It  explained  that  the  Sub-\ncommittee  was  to  “coordinate  and  administ[er]  mar-\nket, price, customer and operation order of Vitamin C \nexport,”  and  to  “hold  .  .  .  working  meetings  for  Vita-\nmin  C  export  to  exchange  information,  summarize \nand  communicate  experience,  analyze  and  work  out \ncoordinated prices for Vitamin C export, to supervise \nand  inspect  the  implementation  of  such  coordinated \nexport  prices  [set]  by  the  Sub-Committee.”   JA82-83.  \nFor  violations,  members  were  subject  to  “warning \n[and] open criticism” – a severe penalty in the Maoist \n\n2  Respondent  North  China  Pharmaceutical  Group  Corp. \n(“NCPG”)  is  a  state-owned  holding  company  and  the  indirect \nparent  corporation  of  Welcome.

JA85-86. \n\nThe Subcommittee was also responsible for the \nChamber’s  “export  administration.”    Specifically,  it \nwas required to “supervise the implementation of ex-\nport license[s] by member enterprises and advis[e] on \nallocation and adjustment of [export] quota, and issu-\nance of export license.”  JA82. \n\n4.  Beginning  in  2002,  the  means  of  enforcing \nprice coordination changed, but the requirement that \nthe  companies  coordinate  export  prices  through  the \nChamber and the Subcommittee did not. \n\nIn  December  2001,  anticipating  the  forthcom-\ning changes, the Chamber convened a meeting of the \nfour manufacturers.  As directed by the Chamber, the \ncompanies  agreed  to  export  volume  limitations  and \nthe Chamber made clear that “[t]he committed export \nvolume as part of the industry self-discipline shall be \nstrictly implemented,” adding that companies “not in \nstrict  compliance  with  this  requirement  will  be  pun-\nished by the Vitamin C Sub-Committee.”  JA459. \n\n“Self-discipline” is a “regulatory process that is \nwell-understood  and  applied  broadly  in  China.”  \nJA138.   “That  process,  by design,  involved communi-\ncations  among  the  relevant  parties  with  a  goal  of \nseeking  agreement  on a  unified  course  of  action  that \nwould implement the mandatory goals of Chinese pol-\nicy[.]”    JA138-39,  174-78.

JA98-101.  It provided: \n\n•  The  objective  was  “to  adjust  the  catalogue  of \nexport  products  subject  to  price  review  by  the \ncustoms  for  year  2002,  in  order  to  accommo-\ndate the new situations since China’s entry in-\nto WTO, maintain the order of market competi-\ntion, make active efforts to avoid anti-dumping \nsanctions . . . , promote industry self-discipline \nand  facilitate  the  healthy  development  of  ex-\nports.”  JA99. \n\n•  Vitamin C and 29 other products were now sub-\nject  “to  price  review  by  the  customs”  under  a \n“Price Verification and Chop (‘PVC’)” procedure.  \nId. \n\n4 Cf.

        "8 \n\n•  “[T]he relevant chambers must . . . submit . . . \ninformation on industry-wide negotiated prices \nfor  those  export  products  subject  to  price  re-\nview[.]”  JA99-100. \n\n•  “The  adoption  of  PVC  procedure  shall  be  con-\nvenient  for  exporters  while  it  is  conducive  for \nthe  chambers  to  coordinate  export  price  and \nindustry self-discipline.”  JA100. \n\nThe  2002  Notice  was  followed  by  a  “2003  An-\nnouncement”  detailing  the  PVC  procedure.    JA102-\n06.  The 2002 Notice had given the various chambers \nand  Customs  the  ability  to  “suspend  export  price  re-\nview for certain products” if the relevant subcommit-\ntee  members  approved.    JA100.    This  provision, \nwhich  was  never  invoked,  was  not  continued  in  the \n2003 Announcement.  JA102-06. \n\nThe 2003 Announcement provided that:  (i) the \nChamber “shall be responsible for implementing” the \nPVC system; (ii) exporters were to specify in the con-\ntracts  “the  prices  and  quantities”;  (iii)  the  Chamber \nwas required to “verify the submissions . . . based on \nthe industry agreements,” “affix V&C chop to the con-\nforming  applications,”  and  send  them  back  to  the \ncompanies for transmission to Customs.  JA104-06. \n\nIn  connection  with  the  2003  Announcement, \nthe  Chamber  revised  its  Charter.    JA53-78.    It  con-\ntinued  as  “a  national-wide  and  self-disciplined  social \nentity voluntarily organized . . . with objectives of the \ntrade coordination and service.”  JA53.  “The objective \nof  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  is  to  coordinate  and \nguide  the  import  and  export  of  medicines  and health \nproducts[.]”  JA54.  Its duties continued to include the \nobligation to “jointly maintain the order of the import \nand export [and to] coordinate the import and export \nprices, market and clients.”  JA55.",
        "9 \n\nThe Subcommittee also revised its charter and \nadministrative  rules.    One  change  was  that,  in  addi-\ntion  to  the  four  major  Vitamin  C  manufacturers  – \nwho  were now  referred  to  as  “Council  Members”  and \n“Member  Organizations”;  JA197,  461  –  the  Subcom-\nmittee  added  11  non-manufacturer  export  trading \ncompanies  and  smaller  manufacturers  as  “member \nenterprises.”    JA462-63;  CAJA2216-17.    Their  addi-\ntion was consistent with the elimination of the discre-\ntionary  (or  “non-automatic”)  license  requirement  for \nexporters.  See pp. 12, 16, 40 below. \n\nThe  Subcommittee’s  coordination  duties  con-\ntinued as before.  The new Charter provided that the \nSubcommittee  would  continue  to  “coordinate  and \nguide  vitamin  C  import  and  export  business  activi-\nties,  promote  self-discipline  in  the  industry,”  as  well \nas  to  “maintain  the  normal  order  for  vitamin  C”  ex-\nports,  and  to  “protect  the  interests  of  the  state,  the \nindustry  and  its  members.”  JA183  (art.  8).    It  con-\nfirmed that: “The Subcommittee will discipline mem-\nbers  [for]  .  .  .  [f]ailure  to  carry  out  industrial  agree-\nments[.]”  JA467-68.    Consistently,  the  Ministry’s \nformal approval in 1997 of the Chamber’s Vitamin C \nSubcommittee,  JA79-80,  including  the  obligation  to \n“coordinat[e] the Vitamin C export market, price and \ncustomers  of  China,”  JA79,  was  never  superseded \nand continued in full force and effect.

Br.  8,  is  unsupported  and  inaccu-\nrate.    The  2002  Notice  unambiguously  required  companies  to \ncoordinate and arrive at industry-wide negotiated prices as part \nof industry self-discipline.  JA99-100.",
        "10 \n\ntion jointly established on a voluntary basis,” JA182, \nand  that  members  had  a  right  “to  freely  resign.”  \nJA186.    Council  members,  however,  including  the \nfour  leading  manufacturers,  were  selected  to  four-\nyear  terms,  JA190,  197,  and  there  was  no  provision \nallowing  a  Council  member  to  resign  its  post.    Thus, \nas “a practical matter,” none of the four major manu-\nfacturers  could  abandon  participation.    JA431.    And \nnone ever did. \n\nExporters  who  were  not  members  of  the  Sub-\n\ncommittee  were  bound by  the  same  PVC  procedures.  \nJA106  (“For  V&C  applications  made  by  non-member \nexporters,  the  Chambers  shall  give  them  the  same \ntreatment  as  to  member  exporters.”).    Consequently, \nall  exporters  were  required  to  adhere  to  the  coordi-\nnated prices set by the Chamber’s members. \n\nUnder  the  revised  2002  regime,  as  before,  ex-\nport prices were not set by the Ministry or the Cham-\nber;  they  were  largely  “fixed  by  enterprises  without \ngovernment  intervention.”    Pet.  Br.  10.    What  China \ncontinued  to  require  was  that  the  companies  them-\nselves  fix  the  prices  under  the  supervision  of  the \nChamber and its Subcommittee; the obligation was to \nreach  “voluntary”  agreements  on  prices  through  in-\ndustrial self-discipline.  JA139.  The prices agreed on \nwere  up  to  the  companies  so  long  as  they  exceeded \nanti-dumping  minima.    JA175-77  (“Properly  under-\nstood,  what  the  government  is  compelling  is  the  ac-\ntive  participation  of  the  industry  in  a  mandated  pro-\ncess which must be obeyed.”); see JA105, 183. \n\nThe changes from the 1997 regime to the 2002 \nregime  were  modest.    Non-manufacturing  trading \ncompanies  and  smaller  manufacturers  could  join  the \nSubcommittee,  and  several  did.    Members  were  per-\nmitted to resign; but there is no evidence that any ev-",
        "11 \n\ner did, and non-members were bound by the same re-\nquirements in any event.  The major change was that \nexport quota restrictions and non-automatic licensing \nwere  eliminated  and  replaced  by  the  PVC  system.  \nJA167-68, 428-30; CAJA3898-99; see also CAJA2012.  \nWhat did not change was the requirement to fix pric-\nes.  The companies remained obligated under PVC to \nengage in industrial self-discipline, to accept the price \ncoordination managed by the Chamber, and to report \nindustry-wide  negotiated  prices  under  Chamber \nguidance.  Price coordination through industrial self-\ndiscipline thus continued as before.  See CAJA2154. \n\n5.  Price-fixing  agreements  are  notoriously  dif-\nficult to monitor and enforce, see George J. Stigler, A \nTheory  of  Oligopoly,  72  J.  POL.  ECON.  44,  44-48 \n(1964),  and  that  is  especially  so  in  a  developing  na-\ntion where the government had controlled all aspects \nof production until the recent past. \n\nStill, PVC was enforced.  The Chamber denied \nchops  to  nonconforming  contracts,  JA434-35,  and  di-\nrected  production  limitations  to  stabilize  prices.  \nJA435.    In  a  few  instances,  manufacturers  initially \ndid  not  follow  a  requirement  to  curtail  production, \nbut  they  were  later  brought  into  compliance.  JA180-\n81,  435-36.  Contracts  were  inspected  by  the  Cham-\nber,  which  “refused  to  affix  our  chop  to  non-\nconforming contracts.”  JA436; see CAJA1767-68.6   \n\n6.

        "12 \n\nministration”  of  Vitamin  C.    JA319.    China  did  not \ngive  up  the  requirement  of  industry  self-discipline, \nnor  the  companies’  obligation  to  reach  industry-wide \nprice  agreements  under  Chamber  coordination.    The \n“export  administration”  China  abandoned,  instead, \nwas  the  regime  of  export  quotas  and  non-automatic \nexport  licensing  for  Vitamin  C  that  China  had  fol-\nlowed prior to 2002.  Id.; JA90, 160, 162, 165, 428-29.  \n\nPolicy  Review \n\nThat  is  what  the  United  States  and  the  WTO \nthemselves  concluded.   See  US-WTO  Submission  ¶¶ \n90-109.  The WTO’s trade reviews all determined that \nwhat  China  had  given  up  in  abandoning  export  ad-\nministration was non-automatic licenses and exporter \nquotas,  not  price  coordination  by  the  Chambers.  See \nWTO,  China  Trade \n2006, \nWT/TPR/S/161, at 104 ¶ 141 & n.120 (Feb. 28, 2006), \navailable  at  goo.gl/H97MgH  (“On  1  January  2002, \nChina  abolished  export  quotas  and  licences  for  .  .  . \nVitamin  C.”);  WTO, Transitional Review Under Arti-\ncle 18 of the Protocol of Accession of the People’s Re-\npublic of China,  G/C/W/438,  at  2-3  ¶  5(a)  (Nov.  20, \n2002),  available at goo.gl/uu7k71.    Contrary  to  the \narguments of Petitioners and some of their amici, e.g., \nPet. Br. 9, 19, 53, China’s representation to the WTO \nthat  it  was  giving  up  export  administration  of  Vita-\nmin C was thus entirely consistent with its continued \nrequirement of price-fixing. \n\n7.  Subsequent  WTO  proceedings \n\ninvolving \nRaw  Materials  and  a  similar  Chamber  of  Commerce \nconfirmed  that,  throughout  the  class  period,  price-\nfixing  of  these  materials,  as  well  as  Vitamin  C,  was \nrequired by China – a conclusion reached not only by \nChina, but by the WTO, the United States, the Euro-\npean Union, and Mexico as well. See JA676-77, 722.",
        "13 \n\nThe  upshot  is  that  every  independent  entity \nthat has analyzed the issues – other than the district \ncourt  below  –  has  concluded  that  China  continued  to \nmandate  price-fixing  for  commodities  subject  to  the \nPVC  procedure  throughout  the  class  period  in  this \ncase:    the  United States,  the  European  Union,  Mexi-\nco, the court of appeals below, and even another fed-\neral district judge in a different case.7   \n\nPlaintiffs  themselves  concede  the  continuation \nof  mandated  price-fixing  under  the  2002  regime.    In \nthe  court  below,  Plaintiffs  said  that  Chinese  law  “re-\nquired the Chamber and its Subcommittee to ‘actively \ncoordinate to set vitamin C export prices and quanti-\nties.’”    Brief  for  Plaintiffs-Appellees  at  25.8   And  in \nthis Court, Plaintiffs similarly acknowledge that: “On \npaper,  ‘verification  and  chop’  required  exporters  to \nsubmit  vitamin  C  export  contracts  to  the  Chamber, \nwhich  was  then  supposed  to  affix  a  seal  (or  ‘chop’)  if \nthe contract met or exceeded an industry-determined \nminimum export price.”  Pet. Br. 8.   \n\nAs  the  preceding  discussion  demonstrates  – \nwithout  even  citing  the  Ministry’s  submissions  –  the \nregulations  themselves  make  clear  that  Chinese  law \ncompelled  price-fixing  throughout  the  class  period.  \nThe  Ministry’s  submissions  confirming  that  fact  are \ndiscussed below. \n\n7 Animal Sci.

The district \ncourt  (Trager,  J.)  concluded  that  the  Ministry  was \n“entitled  to  substantial  deference,  but  [its  brief]  will \nnot  be  taken  as  conclusive  evidence  of  compulsion, \nparticularly where, as here, the plain language of the \ndocumentary evidence submitted by plaintiffs directly \n\n9 The  United  States  is  therefore  mistaken  to  claim  that  there \nhad been no “sworn evidentiary proffer” in support of the Minis-\ntry’s position. See U.S. Br. 24.",
        "15 \n\ncontradicts  the  Ministry’s  position.”   Pet.  App. \n181a.   The  Ministry  had  presented  logical  and  con-\nsistent  explanations  of  what  the  Chinese  regulatory \nregime  required  –  that  the  companies  enter  into  vol-\nuntary  agreements  on  price,  subject  to  the  coordina-\ntion  and  supervision  of  the  Chamber  and  its  Sub-\ncommittee.    See  JA248-50;  Pet.  App.  205a-06a,  208a-\n09a.  Nevertheless, the court concluded that the con-\ncepts of “self-regulation,” “self-restraint,” and “volun-\ntary” participation rendered it unclear “from the rec-\nord at this stage of the case whether defendants were \nperforming  a  government  function,  whether  they \nwere  acting  as  private  citizens  pursuant  to  govern-\nmental directives or whether they were acting as un-\nrestrained private citizens.”  Pet. App. 185a. \n\n2.  In  November  2009,  Defendants  moved  for \nsummary  judgment,  JA29,  supported  by  a  third  for-\nmal submission from the Ministry.  JA247-51.   \n\nThe district court (Cogan, J.) denied the motion \non  the  papers,  without  hearing  oral  argument  from \nthe parties or the Ministry. The court did not apply a \n“substantial  deference”  standard  to  China’s  submis-\nsions.    Cf.  Pet.  Br.  3.    Instead,  the  court  simply  “de-\ncline[d]  to  defer  to  the  Chinese  government’s  state-\nments to the court regarding Chinese law.”  Pet. App. \n56a,  118a-19a.10   The  court  asserted  that,  “when  the \nalleged  compulsion  is  in  the  defendants’  own  self-\ninterest,  a  more  careful  scrutiny  of  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s  statement  is  warranted.”    Id.  121a.    It  said \nthat  the  2009  statement  was  “particularly  undeserv-\ning  of  deference,”  id. 119a,  and  “suggest[ed]  that  the \n\n10 The  court  made  one  exception,  deferring  to  “the  Ministry’s \nexplanation  of  the  relationship  between  the  Ministry  and  the \nChamber.”  Pet. App. 118a.",
        "16 \n\nMinistry’s  assertion  of  compulsion  is  a  post  hoc  at-\ntempt  to  shield  defendants’  conduct  from  antitrust \nscrutiny.”  Id. 121a. \n\nThe  court  asserted  that  the  positions  taken  by \nRespondents and the Ministry were inconsistent with \nChina’s representations to the WTO that it had given \nup  “export  administration”  of  Vitamin  C.    Id.  74a, \n120a-21a, 123a, 136a.  The court, however, never ex-\namined  what  “export  administration”  meant  –  ignor-\ning  that  it  meant  only  non-automatic  licensing  and \nexport quotas, as the United States and the WTO had \nconfirmed.  See p. 12 above. \n\nBypassing  the  Ministry,  the  district  court  of-\nfered  its  own  construction  grounded  in  its  own  in-\nstincts rather than any identifiable principles of Chi-\nnese law.  For example: \n\n•  Despite  the  explicit  written  requirement  that \nexporters could not export unless they reported \nthe  “industry-wide  negotiated  prices”  to  the \nChamber, the court concluded that “defendants \nhad  the  power  to  effectively  suspend  verifica-\ntion  and  chop  simply  by  not  reaching  any \nagreements in the first instance.”  Id. 125a. \n•  As to the provision in the 2002 Notice allowing \nCustoms  and  the  Chambers  to  suspend  price \nreview  with  the  approval  of  the  members,  the \ncourt  elected  to  “interpret  [it]  as  granting  de-\nfendants  the  unilateral  authority  to  suspend \nverification and chop.”  Id. 123a-24a (emphasis \nadded). \n\n•  “Although  the  2003  Announcement  does  not \ncontain a similar explicit suspension provision, \nI construe the 2003 Announcement as granting \ndefendants  the  same  power”  to  suspend  PVC.  \nId. 124a-25a.",
        "17 \n\n•  The  court  concluded  that  the  2002  regime  did \nnot  cover  output  restrictions  even  though  “the \nterm  ‘industry  agreements’  in  the  2003  Proce-\ndures  is  broad  enough  to  also  include  agree-\nments on output restrictions.”  Id. 126a-27a. \n•  “[I]f all the members simply resigned from the \nSubcommittee  .  .  .  there  would  be  no  price  or \noutput  restrictions  that  [non-members]  would \nbe required to follow.”  Id. 135a. \n\nNotwithstanding its acknowledgement that, “to \nreceive  a  chop  under  the  2002  PVC  Notice  and  2003 \nAnnouncement,  an  export  contract  was  .  .  .  required \nto  comply  with  the  industry-agreed  minimum  price,” \nid. 126a, the district court concluded that compulsion \nwas  not  proven  because  China  did  not  dictate  the \nspecific  prices  to  be  set,  and  defendants’  agreements \non  prices  above  a  specified  minimum  went  “beyond \nthe  scope  of  any  potential  compulsion.”    Id.  106a, \n139a-42a. The court understood that Chinese law and \ncustom  are  “something  of  a  departure”  from  the  con-\nstructs of Western society, id. 116a-17a, but proceed-\ned  to  evaluate  China’s  regulatory  system  by  treating \ntranslated  Chinese  terms  of  art  without  regard  to \ntheir meaning and usage in Chinese law.  In particu-\nlar, the court construed “industrial self-discipline” as \nimplicating purely private, unilateral conduct, direct-\nly  contrary  to  the  term’s  actual  meaning  under  Chi-\nnese law, custom, and practice.  Id. 152a; see also id. \n83a n.17, 120a n.39; JA138-39. \n\nThe  court  recognized  that  its  rulings  were  in-\nconsistent with the WTO proceedings in the Raw Ma-\nterials matter, id. 136a-39a, and with the New Jersey \ndistrict  court  decision  in  Animal  Science,  id.  105a-\n106a, but was undeterred.",
        "18 \n\n3.  Following  class  certification,  trial  was  held \nfrom February 25, 2013 to March 14, 2013.  Respond-\nents’  ability  to  defend  themselves  at  trial  was  con-\nstrained.  The  Ministry’s  submissions  and  applicable \nChinese  regulations  were  excluded  from  evidence. \nRespondents proposed to have a former Ministry offi-\ncial,  Qiao  Haili,  offer  a  detailed  description  of  the \nChinese  regulatory  regime  in  which  the  businesses \noperated (supported by copies of the regulations) and \nexplain  how  the  Ministry  compelled  the  conduct  at \nissue.  JA411-39.    Mr.  Qiao  proposed  to  testify  to  the \ncreation of the Chamber and Sub-Committee, the his-\ntory  of  Chinese  Vitamin  C  regulation,  how  the  Sub-\nCommittee  and  Chamber  operated  under  the  guid-\nance  of  the  Ministry  to  effect  Chinese  policy  goals, \nand how the system of “self-discipline” was a manda-\ntory aspect of the Chinese regulatory regime. JA413-\n38. The district court, however, excluded much of this \nevidence,  leaving  only  a  shell  of  Mr.  Qiao’s  proposed \ntestimony. CAJA, at SPA178-88, 216-40. \n\nFollowing  settlements  with  the  other  defend-\nants,  the  jury  found  Respondents  liable  for  violating \nthe  Sherman  Act.    After  post-trial  motion  practice, \nincluding  an  award  of  attorneys’  fees  and  costs  and \noffsets  for  settlement  monies  received,  the  judgment \nawarded  the  Damages  Class  monetary  relief  (includ-\ning attorneys’ fees and costs) of $147,831,471.03 plus \npost-judgment  interest,  and  an  injunction  barring \nRespondents  from  coordinating  prices  for  Vitamin  C \nwithout  regard  for  any  potential  contrary  commands \nof the Chinese government.  JA50-51. \n\n4.  Explaining  that  “China  has  attached  great \nimportance  to  this  case,”  China  submitted  a  formal \nprotest  of  the  district  court’s  rulings in  the  form  of  a",
        "19 \n\ndiplomatic  note  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  \nJA782-84. \n\njurisdiction  on \n\n5.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nvacated the judgment with instructions to dismiss the \ncomplaint.  Pet. App. 1a-38a.  In a unanimous opinion \nby  Judge  Hall  (joined  by  Judges  Cabranes  and  Wes-\nley),  the  court  held  that  the  district  court  abused  its \ndiscretion by denying deference to the Ministry’s for-\nmal  submissions,  and  by  declining  to  abstain  from \nexercising \ncomity \ngrounds.  Citing United States v. Pink,  315  U.S.  203 \n(1942),  the  court  ruled  that  “when  a  foreign  govern-\nment,  acting  through  counsel  or  otherwise,  directly \nparticipates  in  U.S.  court  proceedings  by  providing  a \nsworn  evidentiary  proffer  regarding  the  construction \nand  effect  of  its  laws  and  regulations,  which  is  rea-\nsonable  under  the  circumstances  presented,  a  U.S. \ncourt  is  bound  to  defer  to  those  statements.”    Pet. \nApp. 11a, 25a.  \n\ninternational \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  applied  the  international \ncomity  balancing  test  developed  by  the  circuit  courts \nin  Timberlane  Lumber  Co.  v.  Bank  of  Am.,  549  F.2d \n597,  614-15  (9th  Cir.  1976),  and  Mannington  Mills, \nInc.  v.  Congoleum  Corp.,  595  F.2d  1287,  1297-98  (3d \nCir. 1979); see also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN \nRELATIONS LAW OF THE UNITED STATES  §  403  (1987). \nThe  court  analyzed  the  Ministry’s  submissions  and \nconcluded that its reasonable explanation of the regu-\nlatory  system,  together  with  the  record  available  at \nthe  motion  to  dismiss  stage,  established  conclusively \nthat  it  was  impossible  for  Respondents  to  comply \nwith  both  Chinese  law  and  the  Sherman  Act.  Pet. \nApp.  27a-33a.    The  court  also  determined  that  the \ndistrict  court’s  construction  of  the  system  was  “non-\nsensical”  and  erroneous  in  several  respects  apart",
        "20 \n\nfrom  the  refusal  to  give  any  deference  to  the  Minis-\ntry’s  submissions.  Id.;  see  pp.  45-46  below.    Having \nfound  a  conflict  between  U.S.  and  Chinese  law,  the \ncourt concluded that the remaining comity abstention \nfactors “decidedly weigh[ed] in favor of dismissal and \ncounsel[ed]  against  exercising  jurisdiction  in  this \ncase,” Pet. App. 34a, a point which Petitioners did not \ncontest.11  It thus vacated the judgment with instruc-\ntions  to  dismiss.    Rehearing  was  denied  without  rec-\norded dissent. \n\n6.  Petitioners sought certiorari, and their peti-\ntion was granted on January 12, 2018, limited to the \nquestion  (no.  2)  of  the  appropriate  level  of  deference \nto be given to the Ministry’s submissions. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\n1.    The  standard  for  deference  unanimously \nadopted by the court of appeals is correct.  The court \nanalyzed  the  applicable  Chinese  regulatory  provi-\nsions  and  concluded  that  China’s  formal  interpreta-\ntion  was  reasonable  and  worthy  of  deference.    Its \nstandard,  which  could  be  summarized  as  “defer  if \nreasonable,”  is  consistent  with  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  44.1, \nand  with  this  Court’s  decision  in  Pink.    This  Court \nhas  invariably  deferred  to  the  formal  statements  of \nforeign governments about their own laws, and there \nis no reason to depart from that course here. \n\n11 Petitioners  argued  only  one  aspect  of  the  comity  analysis  be-\nfore  the  court  of  appeals, viz., whether  there  was  a  conflict  be-\ntween  the  Sherman  Act  and  Chinese  law.    Petitioners  did  not \nargue that any of the other recognized comity factors weighed in \ntheir  favor.    Brief  for  Plaintiffs-Appellees  at  45-46  (attached  as \nAnnex B).",
        "21 \n\nThe no deference (or effectively negative defer-\nence) approach deployed by the district court and ad-\nvocated  by  Petitioners  violates  important  interna-\ntional  comity  principles  and  risks  excessively  entan-\ngling  the  federal  courts  in  matters  of  foreign  affairs.  \nThe  amorphous  and  ill-defined  proposals  by  various \namici  supporting  Petitioners  do  no  better,  for  they \nwould  inject  tremendous  uncertainty  into  litigation \nover  the  meaning  of  foreign  law  and  invite  district \ncourts to impose American-style legal analysis on for-\neign regimes whose cultural contexts and legal norms \nmay differ radically from our own. \n\n2.  The Ministry’s construction of its own regu-\nlatory  system  was  accurate,  and  indeed  is  the  only \ncoherent  interpretation  of  that  regime.    As  the  regu-\nlations  specified,  and  as  the  Ministry  explained,  Vit-\namin C exporters were required by China to fix prices \n– to “coordinate” prices as a matter of “industry self-\ndiscipline”  under  the  supervision  of  the  Chamber.  \nThat  view  of  China’s  regulatory  regime  was  con-\nfirmed  in  related  WTO  proceedings  involving  Raw \nMaterials.    There,  the  United  States,  Europe,  and \nMexico, all agreed – relying on the Ministry’s submis-\nsions in this case – that China required exporters “to \nexport at set or coordinated export prices or otherwise \nface penalties.”  The WTO, also relying on the Minis-\ntry’s submissions, concurred. \n\n3.  Petitioners’ request to reinstate the district \ncourt’s  comity  ruling  has  no  merit.    Wholly  apart \nfrom  the  district  court’s  erroneous  and  disrespectful \ndeference standard, the court of appeals correctly re-\njected the district court’s key rulings, concluding that \nthe  court’s  construction  of  China’s  regulatory  system \nwas “nonsensical.”",
        "22 \n\n4.    Irrespective  of  the  level  of  deference  to  the \nMinistry, the judgment should be affirmed.  The only \nissue  on  comity  abstention  below  was  whether  there \nwas a true conflict between the requirements of Chi-\nnese law and the Sherman Act.  The existence of con-\nflict  was  established  not just  by  the  Ministry,  but by \nthe  regulations  themselves  and  their  requirement \nthat  Vitamin  C  exporters  coordinate  their  prices \nthrough industrial self-discipline. \n\nChina’s  requirement  that  competitors  coordi-\nnate  their  prices  compelled  a  per  se  violation  of  the \nSherman Act in direct conflict with U.S. law.  As con-\nflict  was  the  only  comity  issue  contested  below,  this \nCourt  should  affirm  the  judgment  of  the  court  of  ap-\npeals. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI. \n\nTHE  SECOND  CIRCUIT’S  DEFERENCE  STAND-\nARD IS CORRECT AND CONSISTENT WITH RULE \n44.1 \n\nA.  The  Second  Circuit’s  limited  holding  is \nconsistent  with  this  Court’s  controlling \nprecedent and Rule 44.1 \n\n1.   The  Second  Circuit  held  that,  when  pre-\nsented  with  the  official  statement  of  a  foreign  sover-\neign “regarding the construction and effect of its laws \nand  regulations,  which  is  reasonable  under  the  cir-\ncumstances presented, a U.S. court is bound to defer \nto  those  statements.”    Pet.  App.  25a.    This  modest \nholding appropriately  balances  judicial  independence \nagainst the principles of international comity, reflect-\ning  the  respect  owed  to  exercises  of  sovereignty  by \nother nations.  See JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON \nTHE CONFLICT OF LAWS §§ 33, 37-38 (8th ed. 1883).",
        "23 \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  found  that  the  Ministry \nwas  the  “highest  authority  within  the  Chinese  Gov-\nernment  authorized  to  regulate  foreign  trade,”  Pet. \nApp.  6a;  that  the  Ministry  provided  authenticated \ncopies  of  its  regulations,  id.  8a  &  n.6;  and  that  the \nMinistry’s interpretation was reasonable, id. 27a-28a. \nAs  the  court  explained,  the  regulations  themselves \n“demonstrate[d]  that  .  .  .  Chinese  law  required  De-\nfendants to participate in the PVC regime in order to \nexport  vitamin  C.”  Id.  27a.  Petitioners’  characteriza-\ntion  of  the  decision  below  as  applying  “blind  defer-\nence,”  turning  on  the  “bare  fact  of  the  [foreign  gov-\nernment’s] appearance,” e.g., Pet. Br. 22-23, 26, 34, is \nuntenable.    The  court  analyzed  and  specifically  en-\ndorsed the Ministry’s key conclusions. \n\nPetitioners  never  say  precisely  what  standard \nof deference should be applied in this case.  They do, \nhowever,  rely  on  the  district  court’s  assertions  that \nthe Ministry’s statements were a “post-hoc attempt to \nshield  defendants’  conduct,”  Pet.  App.  121a,  and  a \n“carefully crafted and phrased litigation position,” id. \n120a.  See Pet. Br. 18-19, 34-35, 54.  Petitioners thus \nendorse  a  rule  of  negative  deference,  treating  a  for-\neign  sovereign  appearing  before  a  U.S.  court  with \nsuspicion  rather  than  respect.    Such  a  rule  is  anti-\nthetical  to  the  respect  that  the  courts  of  this  nation \nowe  to  “the  independence  of  every  other  sovereign \nstate.”    Underhill  v.  Hernandez,  168  U.S.  250,  252 \n(1897).  \n\n2.  The court of appeals relied appropriately on \nUnited  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S.  203  (1942),  in  adopt-\ning  its  deference  standard.    Pink  held  that  the  “offi-\ncial  declaration”  of  the  Soviet  Commissariat,  which \nhad  the  “power  to  interpret  existing  Russian  law,”",
        "24 \n\nwas  “conclusive”  as  to  the  meaning  of  a  Russian  ex-\npropriation decree.  Id. at 220. \n\nPink  cannot  be  distinguished  from  this  case.  \nFirst,  the  fact  that  the  Commissariat’s  declaration \nwas  received  through  “diplomatic  channels”  was  not \nsignificant  in  itself  but  rather  because  it  proved  the \ndeclaration’s “authenticity and authority.”  Id. at 218, \n221.    The  “authenticity  and  authority”  of  the  Minis-\ntry’s statements in this case has also been established, \nincluding through “diplomatic channels.”  The Minis-\ntry  stated  clearly  that  it  was  authorized  to  present \nthe  “official  views  of  the  People’s  Republic of  China,” \nJA131,  and  that  authority  was  confirmed  in  China’s \ndiplomatic note to the State Department, JA782-84.  \n\nSecond,  the  “conclusive”  effect  given  to  the \nCommissariat’s  declaration  based  solely  on  the  Com-\nmissariat’s “power to interpret existing Russian law,” \nPink, 315 U.S. at 220, cannot be squared with the Pe-\ntitioners’  claim,  Pet.  Br.  40,  that  other  record  evi-\ndence  was  somehow  crucial  to  the  decision.    The \nCourt  did  not  cite  any  other  evidence  except  for  a \npassing  observation  that  the  “expert  testimony  ten-\ndered by the United States gave great credence” to its \nposition on the Russian decree in a prior case.  Pink, \n315 U.S. at 218.  Before the case reached this Court, \nhowever, the New York courts had found that the ev-\nidence  established  that  the  Russian  decrees  did  not \napply  extraterritorially.    See  Moscow  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v. \nBank  of  N.Y.  &  Trust  Co.,  280  N.Y.  286,  309-11 \n(1939),  aff’d  by  an  equally  divided  Court,  309  U.S. \n624 (1940).  This Court declined to parse the evidence \nbecause Russia’s contrary statement was “conclusive.” \n(In  this  case,  in  any  event,  the  record  outside  the \nMinistry’s proffer confirms that  the Ministry’s expla-\nnation was correct.  See pp. 4-11 above.)",
        "25 \n\n3.   This  Court  has  never  deviated  from  the \nclear rule of deference established in Pink more than \n75 years ago.  Petitioners identify no case where this \nCourt has rejected (or even questioned) a foreign gov-\nernment’s  explanation  of  its  own  law,  and  research \nhas  identified  none.    This  Court  has  consistently \nframed its holdings to accord with the explanations of \nforeign  sovereigns,  implicitly  treating  them  as  cor-\nrect.    See  Abbott  v.  Abbott,  560  U.S.  1,  10-12,  14-15 \n(2010);  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank  v.  Traffic  Stream \n(BVI)  Infrastructure  Ltd.,  536  U.S.  88,  98-99  (2002); \nDoe  v.  United  States,  487  U.S.  201,  218  n.16  (1988); \ncf.  Republic  of  Philippines  v.  Pimentel,  553  U.S.  851, \n866-67  (2008)  (“[W]here  sovereign  immunity  is  as-\nserted,  and  the  claims  of  the  sovereign  are  not  frivo-\nlous,  dismissal  of  the  action  must  be  ordered  where \nthere  is  a  potential  for  injury  to  the  interests  of  the \nabsent sovereign.”).   \n\nThe  cases  cited  by  Petitioners  and  their  amici \nare  not  to  the  contrary.    First  National  City  Bank  v. \nBanco  Para  El  Comercio  Exterior  de  Cuba  (Bancec) \ninvolved  the  trial  testimony  of  an  attorney  in  Cuba’s \nForeign  Trade  Ministry,  not  an  official  statement  by \nthe Cuban government. 462 U.S. 611, 616 n.3 (1983).  \nRegardless,  the  Court  did  not  dispute  the  witness’s \ntestimony that Bancec had “independent legal status” \nunder  Cuban  law,  id.,  but  found  that  choice  of  law \nprinciples  dictated  that  Cuban  law  should  not  apply \nto  an  expropriation  claim  not  arising  under  Cuban \nlaw.  Id. at 621-23.  Similarly, in Intel Corporation v. \nAdvanced  Micro  Devices,  Inc.,  the  Court  did  not  dis-\npute  the  European  Commission’s  description  of  its \npowers and role within the EU legal system.  542 U.S. \n241,  254-55  (2004).    The  Court  rejected  only  the \nCommission’s  view  of  the  significance  of  those  facts",
        "26 \n\nunder U.S. law, finding that based on its own descrip-\ntion  the  Commission  was  a  “tribunal”  as  the  term  is \nused in 28 U.S.C. § 1782.  542 U.S. at 258.   \n\n4.  Both  Pink  and  the  decision  below  are  con-\n\nsistent with FED. R. CIV. P. 44.1.   \n\nThere  is  nothing  in  the  text  or  history  of  Rule \n44.1 that suggests it was intended to alter or overrule \nPink.  Nor is there any conceptual incompatibility be-\ntween  the  general  obligation  of  courts  to  determine \nforeign  law  under  Rule  44.1  and  rules  that  focus \ncourts’ discretion in doing so.   \n\nRule  44.1  was  designed  to  end  unpredictable \nfactual  inquiries  in  favor  of  more  orderly  resolutions \nmade as a matter of law.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 44.1 ad-\nvisory committee note.  There is no incompatibility in \nsaying that, within the determination of this question \nof  law,  all  sources  should  be  considered  but  the  offi-\ncial submission of a foreign government should be fol-\nlowed  if  not  unreasonable.    In  fact,  fashioning  clear \nrules  for  the  weight  afforded  to  specific  types  of \nsources is fully consistent with the fact that the Rule \n44.1  inquiry  is  a  determination  of  law  reviewed  de \nnovo on appeal, not a factual determination involving \nweighing evidence and assessing credibility.  \n\n5.   Each  of  the  appellate  cases  cited  by  Peti-\ntioners is consistent with the Second Circuit’s holding \nthat  conclusive  deference  is  due  only  when  a  foreign \ngovernment appears before a U.S. court and presents \nan  official  governmental  explanation  of  its  domestic \nlaw  that  is  reasonable.    See  United  States v.  McNab, \n331 F.3d 1228, 1233-35, 1240-42 (11th Cir. 2003) (dis-\ntrict court properly deferred to initial Honduran gov-\nernment  interpretation;  court  of  appeals  declined  to \noverturn  judgment  based  on  new  and  inconsistent",
        "27 \n\nHonduran  interpretation  received  post-judgment); \nMcKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 \nF.3d  1101,  1108-09  (D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (crediting  Iran’s \naffidavits  but  observing  that  they  described  no  bind-\ning  requirement  under  Iranian  law),  vacated,  320 \nF.3d 280 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI \nTelecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d  694,  714  (5th  Cir.  1999) \n(declining  to  defer  to  a  Mexican  agency  circular \nwhere the Mexican government did not appear, and it \nwas  unclear  whether  circular  applied  given  legal \nchanges post-dating the circular). \n\n6.  The  approach  adopted  by  the  Second  Cir-\ncuit  is  also  eminently  practical.  As  one  commentator \nhas observed:  \n\nHolding  that  U.S.  courts  can  second  guess \nthe  highest  administrative  authority  of  a \nforeign  state  on  interpretations  of  that \nstate’s  law  would  raise  serious  practical \nproblems.  Most  obviously,  it  would  create \ndifficulties  for  the  regulated  entities,  who \nface  the  possibility  of  being  told  by  a  for-\neign  regulator  that  they  must  do  x  and \nthen being told by a U.S. court that the for-\neign  regulator  misunderstood  its  own  do-\nmestic  law  and  that  they  should  not  have \ndone x. \n\nDaniel  A.  Crane,  The  Chinese  Vitamins  Case:  Who \nDecides  Chinese  Law?,  COMPETITION POLICY INT’L,  at \n4  (March  2018),  available  at  goo.gl/J9wKp8.    The \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  thus  helps  avoid  the  incon-\nsistent  obligations  that  would  likely  arise  if  the  fed-\neral  courts  routinely  second-guessed  foreign  regula-\ntors’ interpretations of their own laws.",
        "28 \n\nB.  International comity principles counsel a \nstrong standard of deference for foreign \nsovereigns \n\n1.  International  comity  is  the  “recognition \nwhich  one  nation  allows  within  its  territory  to  the \nlegislative,  executive  or  judicial  acts  of  another  na-\ntion,  having  due  regard  both  to  international  duty \nand convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens, \nor of other persons who are under the protection of its \nlaws.”  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.S.  113,  163-64  (1895).  \nThis  recognition  is  not  an  “absolute  obligation,”  but \nneither  is  it,  as  Petitioners  suggest,  a  voluntary  ex-\ntension  based  on  “mere  courtesy  and good will.”    Id.; \nsee  also  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  v.  Soler  Chrysler-\nPlymouth,  Inc.,  473  U.S.  614,  629  (1985)  (arbitration \nclause  in international  agreement  enforceable  due  to \n“concerns  of  international  comity  .  .  .  even  assuming \nthat  a  contrary  result  would  be  forthcoming  in  a  do-\nmestic context”).     \n\nInternational  comity  is  not  a  “vague  political \nconcern favoring international cooperation when it is \nin  our  interest  to  do  so”;  it  is  also  motivated  by  pro-\nmoting  “reciprocal  tolerance  and  goodwill.”    Societe \nNationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. U.S. Dist. Court, \n482 U.S. 522, 555 (1987) (Blackmun, J., concurring in \npart  and  dissenting  in  part).    Comity  requires  more \nthan  merely  “prioritiz[ing]  accuracy,  reliability,  and \njudicial  independence.”    Pet.  Br.  44.    It  requires  also \nrespect  for  the  knowledge  that  foreign  sovereigns \nhave about their own laws. See In re Oil Spill by the \nAmoco Cadiz Off the Coast of France, 954 F.2d 1279, \n1312  (7th  Cir.  1992).    It  would  be  anomalous  to  re-\nspect  a  foreign  government  while  disrespecting  the \nformal  representations  it  makes  before  U.S.  courts.  \nAccordingly, this Court has in other contexts granted",
        "29 \n\nvery substantial deference to the reasonable explana-\ntions of foreign sovereigns.  See Pimentel, 553 U.S. at \n866-67  (comity  requires  that  U.S.  defer  to  a  nation’s \nnon-frivolous assertions of sovereign immunity); p. 25 \nabove.  There  is  no  justification  for  withholding  simi-\nlar  treatment  for  foreign  sovereigns’  explanations  of \nthe meaning of their own laws. \n\nA  strong  deference  rule  in  cases  like  this  one \nthus  “helps  the  potentially  conflicting  laws  of  differ-\nent  nations  work  together  in  harmony—a  harmony \nparticularly  needed  in  today’s  highly  interdependent \ncommercial  world.”    F.  Hoffmann-La  Roche  Ltd.  v. \nEmpagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 164-65 (2004); see also \nSosa  v.  Alvarez-Machain,  542  U.S.  692,  761  (2004) \n(Breyer,  J.,  concurring  in  relevant  part).    Failing  to \ncredit a foreign sovereign’s reasonable explanation of \nits own laws, particularly where that explanation re-\nveals a true conflict of law, can be an “act of legal im-\nperialism”  that  increases  friction  between  nations, \nimpairing the application of U.S. law and the promo-\ntion of U.S. interests.  Empagran, 542 U.S. at 169; see \nalso  Microsoft  Corp.  v.  AT&T  Corp.,  550  U.S.  437, \n454  (2007)  (noting  “presumption  that  United  States \nlaw  governs  domestically  but  does  not  rule  the \nworld”). \n\n2.  Petitioners  misplace  reliance  on  two  re-\ngional  treaties  –  to  which  the  United  States  is  not  a \nsignatory  –  that  simply  create  a  common,  non-\nexclusive  mechanism  for  sharing  information.    The \ntreaties do not address the official statement of a for-\neign sovereign as to the meaning of its own laws; they \ninstead focus on the treatment of information shared \nthrough treaty channels – information that may come \nfrom  any  number  of  sources,  including  private  law-\nyers,  experts,  academics,  judges,  and  other  unspeci-",
        "30 \n\nfied but non-binding avenues of finding foreign law.12  \nAnd both treaties make clear that they merely estab-\nlish a baseline that does not displace any other rules \nor standards that signatories may have implemented \nfor considering questions of foreign law.13   \n\nThere  is  no  inconsistency  in  affording  greater \ndeference when a government asserts its sovereignty \nby making the affirmative decision to appear in a liti-\ngation  to  correct  or  forestall  a  misunderstanding  of \nits  laws  than  when  responding  less  formally  under \ntreaties  such  as  these.    If  the  call  of  international \ncomity on “each nation state . . . to ‘respect the inde-\npendence  and  dignity  of  every  other’”  is  to  have \nmeaning, it  must  matter  greatly  when  one  sovereign \nappears in the courts of another to explain in official \nterms what its own laws require of its own subjects in \nits  own  territory.    Bolivarian  Republic  of  Venez.  v. \n\n12 See, e.g., The European Convention on Information on Foreign \nLaw,  art.  8,  June  7,  1968,  720  U.N.T.S.  154  (allowing  states  to \ndelegate  responsibility  for  replies  to  private  bodies);  Inter-\nAmerican  Convention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on  Foreign \nLaw,  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  1439  U.N.T.S.  111  (“Inter-American \nConvention”)  (the  nation  providing  information  “shall  not  be \nheld  responsible  for  the  opinion  expressed  nor  shall  it  be  re-\nquired to apply the law, or cause it to be applied, in accordance \nwith the content of the reply provided”).  The same is true of the \nHague  Conference  proposal  cited  by  Petitioners.   See Response \nof the United States of America to Feasibility Study on the \nTreatment of Foreign Law Questionnaire,  Preliminary  Doc.

Petitioners’  comparison  to  treaty  interpre-\ntation generally also fails.  There are good reasons to \ngrant  a  higher  degree  of  deference  in  this  case  than \nthe “great weight” that this Court has given to Execu-\ntive  Branch  interpretations  of  treaties.    Sumitomo \nShoji  Am.,  Inc.  v.  Avagliano,  457  U.S.  176,  184-85 \n(1982).    First,  treaties  are  bilateral  agreements  be-\ntween  sovereigns,  and  the  parties  to  a  treaty  may \ndisagree  as  to  the  interpretation  of  its  provisions.  \nThis  case  concerns  a  sovereign’s  explanation  of  its \nunilaterally  enacted  legislation.   Second,  treaties  are \nagreements  to  cede  a  degree  of  sovereignty  in  ex-\nchange for some benefit.  Lawmaking is an exercise of \nsovereignty,  and  thus  a  foreign  government  may \nrightly  expect  a  higher  degree  of  deference  when  ex-\nplaining the meaning of its laws.14   \n\n4.   Petitioners’  analogies  to  domestic  contexts \n\nfail to capture the relevant international concerns. \n\nAs  the  United  States  points  out,  deference \nrules for U.S. administrative agencies do “not readily \ntranslate”  to  the  present  context.    U.S.  Br.  20.  Peti-\ntioners  nevertheless  attempt  to  impose  the  frame-\nwork  of  Chevron,  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), as the ceil-\ning for  deference  to  a  foreign  sovereign.   Pet.  Br.  48-\n\n14 Petitioners wrongly  suggest  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  holding \nrequires  courts  to  give  greater  deference  to  foreign  agencies \nthan to the U.S. Department of State as to the meaning of trea-\nties.  Pet. Br. 51 n.16.  The decision below is limited to a foreign \nsovereign’s explanations of its domestic law.  Pet. App. 11a-12a, \n34a.",
        "32 \n\n55.    Chevron  deference,  however,  is  based on  respect \nfor the division of powers among coordinate branches \nof  the  same  government.    By  contrast,  the  deference \nafforded  to  a  foreign  government  as  a  matter  of  in-\nternational  comity  derives  from  respect  for  its  inde-\npendent sovereign authority.  Hilton, 159 U.S. at 163-\n64; see Access Telecom, 197 F.3d at 714 (rejecting ar-\ngument that Chevron directly bore on the question of \ndeference  to  a  foreign  agency).    If  Chevron  has  any \nrelevance here, it is because it would be anomalous to \ngive  less  respect  to  a  foreign  sovereign’s  direct  exer-\ncise  of  independent  sovereignty  than  to  an  adminis-\ntrative  agency’s  domestic  exercise  of  delegated  rule-\nmaking  authority.  Amoco  Cadiz,  954  F.2d  at  1312 \n(“Giving the conclusions of a sovereign nation less re-\nspect  than  those  of  [a  U.S.]  administrative  agency  is \nunacceptable.”). \n\nPetitioners’  comparison  to  deference  rules  for \nstate  governments  fares  no  better.    Petitioners  are \nincorrect  that  this  Court  has  held  that  the  Constitu-\ntion requires federal courts to give greater  respect to \nstate  governments  than  to  foreign  sovereigns.    The \nauthority they cite, Bond v. Hume, concerns only “the \nrelation of the several states to each other.”  243 U.S. \n15,  22  (1917)  (emphasis  added).    In  any  case,  Peti-\ntioners  concede  that  constructions  of  state  law  made \nby the highest court of a state receive conclusive def-\nerence in U.S. federal courts.  Pet. Br. 56; accord U.S. \nBr. 27 (“binding”).",
        "33 \n\nDeference  rules  for  state  governments  provide \nno  support  for  the no deference  rule  Petitioners  urge \nhere.15 \n\nC.  Deference  is  particularly  appropriate  in \nthis  case  because  it  implicates  a  conflict \nbetween  sharply  divergent  economic  and \ntrade regimes properly reserved for reso-\nlution by the political branches \n\n1.  A high degree of deference to foreign sover-\neigns’  reasonable  explanations  of  their  own  laws  is \nnecessary to avoid interference with the international \nrelations prerogatives of the political branches.  This \nCourt  has  held  in  many  contexts  that  separation-of-\npowers  concerns  and  recognition  of  the  limits  of  the \njudiciary’s  institutional  competence  warrant  great \ncare  to  avoid  negative  foreign  policy  consequences.   \nKiobel  v.  Royal  Dutch  Petroleum  Co.,  569  U.S.  108, \n116 (2013); see also Sosa, 542 U.S. at 727 (recognition \nof  new  claims  under  the  Alien  Tort  Statute);  Banco \nNacional  de  Cuba  v.

Sociedad \n\n15 The standard of deference advocated by the United States ap-\npears  to  be  one  of  substantial  deference,  but  the  government \nadds a long list of factors that render its ultimate standard un-\nclear.  U.S. Br. 16-21.  Such a vague standard would give district \ncourts no guidance and would undermine Rule 44.1’s objective of \nclarity and consistency. Cf. Benjamin G. Bradshaw, et al., Inter-\nnational Comity in the Enforcement of U.S. Antitrust Law in the \nWake of In re Vitamin C,  31  ANTITRUST  87,  90  (Spring  2017) \n(praising  “clarity”  of  Second  Circuit’s  approach).    The  U.S. \nChamber articulates a standard of “substantial deference.”  Pro-\nvided that the foreign sovereign’s construction of its own laws is \n“reasonable,” Pet. App. 25a, or “not frivolous,” Pimentel, 553 U.S. \nat 866-67, a substantial deference standard should require that \nconstruction to be followed – just as the court of appeals did here.",
        "34 \n\nNacional  de  Marineros  de  Honduras,  372  U.S.  10 \n(1963)  (application  of  the  National  Labor  Relations \nAct).  The case for deference to the political branches \nconcerning  “delicate  field[s]  of  international  rela-\ntions” is at its strongest where “the possibilities of in-\nternational discord are . . . evident and retaliative ac-\ntion . . . certain.”  Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, \nS.A., 353 U.S. 138, 147 (1957).   \n\nThe  extraterritorial  application  of  U.S.  anti-\ntrust  laws  implicates  “a  foreign nation’s  ability  inde-\npendently  to  regulate  its  own  commercial  affairs,”  a \nsensitive aspect of international relations. Empagran, \n542 U.S. at 165; see also Timberlane, 549 F.2d at 612.  \nAnd,  as  this  case  demonstrates,  the  risk  of  interna-\ntional  discord  is  particularly  acute  when  U.S.  anti-\ntrust law is applied to conduct required under foreign \nlaw.    The  district  court’s  disrespectful  treatment  of \nand  refusal  to  grant  any  deference  to  the  Ministry \ntriggered  an  immediate  diplomatic  response:  the \nChinese government formally protested its treatment \nin a diplomatic note to the U.S. Department of State \nthat  emphasized  the  “great  importance”  that  China \nattaches to this case and to the degree of respect that \nits  official  statements  receive  in  foreign  courts.  \nJA782-84.  A Ministry spokesperson hinted at broad-\ner  economic  consequences  as  well,  stating  that  the \ndistrict  court  ruling  would  “cause  problems  for  the \ninternational  community  and  international  enter-\nprises”  and  predicting  an  “increase  of  international \ndisputes”  that  “will  eventually  harm  the  interests  of \nthe  United  States.”    CAJA1666;  see  also  CAJA1667-\n72,  1678-79.    If  the  United  States  wants  China  to \nchange  its  regulatory  system  for  exports,  that  is  a \nmatter for diplomats, not a private class action.",
        "35 \n\n2.  Dissatisfaction  with  the  manner  in  which \nChina  has  chosen  to  regulate  Vitamin  C  exports  is \nnot  a  basis  for  refusing  deference.    “[T]he  courts  of \none  country  [should]  not  sit  in  judgment  on  the  acts \nof  the  government  of  another,  done  within  its  own \nterritory.”  Underhill, 168 U.S. at 252. \n\nRefusing deference on that basis would also be \nshort-sighted.

See United \nStates  v.  Minn.  Mining  &  Mfg.  Co.,  92  F.  Supp.  947, \n965 (D. Mass. 1950).  The United States has also cho-\nsen in a variety of contexts to authorize private firms \nto make industry-wide price and output decisions un-\nder government supervision.16  \n\n16 See, e.g., Horne v.

App. 116a, and that English trans-\nlations  of  Chinese  terms  of  art  may  not  accurately \ncapture  their  meaning  in  China.  Id.  97a.    These  ob-\nservations should have underscored the need for def-\nerence to the Ministry.  Id. 29a.  But instead, the dis-\ntrict court undertook its own evaluation – essentially \ntreating  the  Ministry’s  regulations  as  though  they \nwere the product of U.S. law and relying primarily on \nthe  court’s  own  view  of  their  post-translation  “plain \nlanguage.”  Id. 97a, 116a-17a.

Unsurprisingly,  that  pro-\ncess yielded incoherent and erroneous conclusions.   \n\nII. \n\nTHE  MINISTRY’S  CONSTRUCTION  OF  CHINESE \nLAW WAS CORRECT \n\nA.  China’s construction of its regulatory sys-\n\ntem was logical and coherent \n\nThe  Ministry’s  amicus  brief  on  the  motion  to \ndismiss,  Pet.  App.  189a-223a,  supplemented  by  its \nlater  submissions,  JA127-33,  247-51,  provided  a \ncommon  sense  and  coherent  interpretation  of  the \nregulatory  regime  China  had  imposed.    As  the  court \nof  appeals  said,  the  Ministry  “reasonabl[y]  ex-\nplain[ed]” \n\nthe government’s expectation that private ac-\ntors  actively  self-regulate  to  achieve  the  gov-\nernment’s  policy  goals  in  order  to  minimize \nthe  need  for  the  government  to  resort  to \nstronger  enforcement  methods.  In  this  con-\ntext,  we  find  it  reasonable  to  view  the  entire \nPVC  regime  as  a  decentralized  means  by \nwhich  the  Ministry,  through  the  Chamber, \nregulated the export of vitamin C by deferring \nto  the  manufacturers  and  adopting  their \nagreed  upon  price  as  the  minimum  export \nprice. In short, by directing vitamin C manu-\nfacturers  to  coordinate  export  prices  and \nquantities  and  adopting  those  standards  into \nthe  regulatory  regime,  the  Chinese  Govern-\nment  required  Defendants  to  violate  the \nSherman Act.",
        "40 \n\nPet.  App.  28a.  The  contrary  interpretation  urged  by \nPetitioners  and  the  district  court,  in  contrast,  was \n“nonsensical,” as it described a system that would col-\nlapse before it even began.  Id. 27a-28a. \n\nB.  China’s  representations  to  the  WTO  are \nentirely  consistent  with  its  position  in \nthis case \n\n1.  A  crucial  error  that  has  infected  this  case \nfrom  the  outset  is  the  idea  that  China’s  representa-\ntions  to  the  WTO  were  inconsistent  with  its  argu-\nments  in  this  case  –  that  giving  up  “export  admin-\nistration”  meant  giving  up  industrial  self-discipline \nand price coordination.  That error was critical to the \ndistrict court’s decision, Pet. App. 74a, 120a-21a, and \nhas been unfortunately repeated here by some of Pe-\ntitioners’  amici.    See,  e.g.,  AAI  Br.  16.    By  asserting \nthat  China  was  speaking  out  of  both  sides  of  its \nmouth, Petitioners have tried to bring this case with-\nin the rule suggested by McNab, 331 F.3d at 1233-35, \nthat  deference  is  not  owed  when  the  foreign  sover-\neign’s statements are inconsistent. \n\nThere  is  not  and  has  never  been  any  incon-\nsistency.    China  never  said  that  it  had  given  up  in-\ndustrial self-discipline and price coordination when it \nentered the WTO.  See p. 12 above.  What it gave up \nwas  the  requirement  that  exporters  of  Vitamin  C  be \nsubject to discretionary licensing or company-specific \nexport  quotas.  JA90,  160,  162,  165,  319,  428-29.  \nNothing  in  the  WTO’s  trade  reviews  and  nothing  in \nthe  later  submissions  by  the  United  States  (or  the \nother complainants) indicated that China had agreed \nto  abandon  industrial  self-discipline  or  price  and \nquantity coordination.",
        "41 \n\n2.  This  made-up  inconsistency  is  the  only  in-\n\nconsistency offered by Petitioners or any of the amici.  \nBecause there was in fact no inconsistency at all, the \narguments  that  the  Ministry  is  not  entitled  to  defer-\nence on that basis necessarily fail. \n\nC.  The WTO Raw Materials proceedings con-\nfirm  the  appropriateness  of  deference  to \nthe Ministry in this case \n\n1.  The WTO “Raw Materials” proceedings con-\nfirmed both that the requirement to fix prices contin-\nued  throughout  the  class  period,  and  that  deference \nto the Ministry was appropriate.   \n\nThe proceedings related to bauxite, phosphorus, \nand  other  similar  materials.    These  products  were \nunder the auspices of a different chamber of the Min-\nistry,  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  of  Metals  Minerals \n& Chemicals Importers & Exporters (“CCCMC”).   \n\nThat Chamber had a variety of responsibilities, \nincluding  the  promotion  of  industry  self-discipline \nand coordinating prices among the members.  JA685-\n91.  In those respects, its operations were identical to \nthose  of  the  Chamber  at  issue  here.    See  US-WTO \nSubmission ¶ 208. \n\nAt  the  WTO,  the  United  States,  Europe,  and \nMexico – as complainants – explained “that China co-\nordinates  export  prices  for  the  products  at  issue \nthrough a ‘system of self-discipline’ based on informal \nstatements and oral agreements between traders and \nexport  regulators  and  where  the  CCCMC  directs \ncommodity-specific  branches  or  coordination  groups.” \nJA676.   \n\nThe  only  disagreement  on  this  issue  was \nwhether,  as  China  argued,  price-fixing  was  only",
        "42 \n\nmandated through 2008, when the PVC system ended, \nor  whether  it  continued  into  2010.    JA677-79.20   The \nWTO  Panel  sided  with  the  complainants,  concluding \nthat “China require[d] exporting enterprises to export \nat  set  or  coordinated  export  prices  or  otherwise  face \npenalties” through 2010.  JA722.21   \n\nThe submission of the United States focused on \nhow  the  CCCMC  effectively  mandated  the  price-\nfixing regime.  As the United States explained, “Chi-\nna’s Chambers of Commerce . . . play a central role in \nregulating  the  trade  of  China’s  industries.”    See  US-\nWTO  Submission  ¶  207.    It  identified  “the  coordina-\ntion  of  export  prices”  as  one  of  “the  key  areas  in \nwhich the CCCMC coordinates export activities,” add-\ning that “the industry coordinated export price is con-\nsidered  ‘a  collective  contract’  that  industry  members \nmust abide by.”  Id. ¶¶ 210, 217.  The United States \nalso  explained  how  the  PVC  system  mandated  price-\nfixing: \n\nThe PVC procedure requires exporters of yel-\nlow  phosphorus  to  submit  their  export  con-\ntracts  to  the  CCCMC  for  “verification.”  The \nCCCMC  is  required  to  examine  the  export \n\n20 Throughout the WTO proceedings, price-fixing was never dis-\nputed.    One  issue  was  whether  the  compulsion  of  price-fixing \nviolated  China’s  obligations  under  Art.  XI:1  of  the  General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”).  China argued that it \ndid not, but the WTO Panel concluded otherwise.  JA722-24.   \n\n21 The Panel’s factual findings were upheld by the WTO’s appel-\nlate body, but the conclusions as to whether the price-fixing and \nsome  other  measures  violated  GATT  were  vacated  because  of \nthe  lack  of  specificity  in  the  complainants’  original  complaints.  \nReports of the Appellate Body, China – Measures Related to the \nExportation of Various Raw Materials,  WT/DS394,  WT/DS395, \nWT/DS398 (Jan. 30, 2012), available at goo.gl/ZvH6AK.",

The  CCCMC  must  return  the \ncontract  to  the  exporter  within  three  days. \nOnce the exporter receives the verified export \ncontract  bearing  the  CCCMC’s  PVC  chop,  it \nmust  declare  the  contract  to  Customs  for \nclearance.

E.g.,  First  Written  Submission  by \nthe European Union, China – Measures Related to the \nExportation  of  Various  Raw  Materials,  WT/DS394, \nWT/DS395,  WT/DS398  ¶¶  356-57,  360-68  (June  1, \nat \n2010) \ngoo.gl/uYjFhX; JA676. \n\n(“EU-WTO  Submission”), \n\navailable \n\n2.  In  this  Court,  the  United  States  seeks  to \nlimit  the  weight  of  its  own  successful  argument  be-\nfore  the  WTO.    U.S.  Br.  31  n.7.    It  argues  that  the \n“proceedings  involved  a  different  record  and  other \n\n22 The WTO Panel endorsed the position taken by complainants \nbut  declined  to  address  the  PVC  regulations  on  the  basis  that \nthey  were  “outside  the  Panel’s  terms  of  reference”  because  not \nspecified in the original complaints.  JA726. The Panel based its \nruling  on  the  broad  requirement  to  “set  or  coordinat[e]    export \nprices or otherwise face penalties.”  JA722-24.",
        "44 \n\ncommodities,”  and  that  the  legal  standard  only  re-\nquired proof  that  the  price-fixing be  “attributable  to” \nChina,  rather  than  “required.”    Id.    Both  statements \nare true. Neither makes a difference. \n\nIn  every  relevant  respect,  regulation  by  the \nCCCMC  was  identical  to  regulation  by  the  Chamber \nhere.    The  CCCMC’s  job  was  to  oversee  mandatory \nprice  and  output  coordination  by  its  members  and  to \nadminister  the  PVC  system  for  yellow  phosphorous, \nfunctions identical to the Chamber’s in this case. See \nUS-WTO  Submission  ¶¶  208-09.    The  United  States \nidentifies  no  material  differences.  Nor  can  it;  its  ar-\nguments  were  based  largely  on  the  Ministry’s  sub-\nmissions about Vitamin C in this case.  Id. \n\nAs  for  the  “attributable  to”  standard,  the  gov-\nernment ignores the fact that it argued (and the WTO \nand other complainants agreed) that price-fixing was \n“attributable  to  China”  because  it  was  required  by \nChina.    US-WTO  Submission  ¶¶  207,  210,  217,  224.  \nAs  the  WTO  found,  “China  requires  exporting  enter-\nprises to export at set or coordinated export prices or \notherwise face penalties[.]”  JA722 (emphasis added). \n\n3.  At  the  WTO,  the  United  States,  the  Euro-\npean Union, Mexico, and the WTO itself all relied ex-\ntensively on the Ministry’s amicus brief in the district \ncourt  in  this  case.  See  US-WTO  Submission  ¶¶  207-\n08 & passim; EU-WTO Submission ¶¶ 171-72 & pas-\nsim;  JA680-82,  728.   In  related  proceedings,  the  Dis-\ntrict of New Jersey did so as well.  Animal Sci., 702 F. \nSupp.  2d  at  426-29.   No  one  described  the Ministry’s \npositions  as  self-serving,  inconsistent  with  China’s \nrepresentations  to  the  WTO  about  giving  up  export \nadministration,  or  in  any  way  biased  or  inaccurate. \nAll  relied  on  the  Ministry’s  accurate  description  of \nChina’s regulatory system.",
        "45 \n\nHaving  relied  on  the  Ministry’s  explanation  to \nadvance  its  position  at  the  WTO,  it  is  unseemly  for \nthe United States now to suggest that the very same \nMinistry statements could be unreliable. \n\nIII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  APPROACH \n\nAND OUTCOME \n\n1.  By  asserting  that,  where  compulsion  is  in \nthe defendants’ self-interest, “more careful scrutiny of \na  foreign  government’s  statement  is  warranted,”  and \nthat  the  Ministry’s  statements  were  “a  post-hoc  at-\ntempt  to  shield  defendants’  conduct  from  antitrust \nscrutiny,” Pet. App. 121a, the district court effectively \napplied  a  standard  of  negative  deference.    Foreign \ngovernments  rarely  appear  in  U.S.  cases,  and,  when \nthey  do,  it  is  almost  invariably  to  support  the  inter-\nests  of  their  nationals.    See  Empagran,  542  U.S.  at \n167-68.  To decline deference on that basis is to afford \nno deference at all. \n\n2.  Point  IV  in  Petitioners’  brief  seeks  to  have \nthis  Court  reinstate  the  district  judge’s  rejection  of \nRespondents’  comity  defense.    Pet.  Br.  57-59.    They \nargue that footnote 10 of the Second Circuit’s opinion, \nwhich  they  quote  five  separate  times,  reflects  a  de-\ntermination  by  that  court  that,  but  for  the  deference \nstandard,  the  district  court’s  comity  ruling  was  cor-\nrect.  Pet. Br. 3, 23, 34, 58, 59.  Footnote 10 does not \nbear  the  weight  Petitioners  put  on  it  and,  even  if  it \ndid,  there  would  be  no  basis  to  uphold  the  district \ncourt’s ruling.   \n\nApproving the “careful and thorough treatment \nof the evidence before it” is an approval of the district \ncourt’s  process  (had  China  not  appeared),  not  an  ap-\nproval of its outcome.  Pet. App. 30a n.10.  In fact, the \ncourt  of  appeals  made  clear  that,  separate  from  the",
        "46 \n\nstandard  of  deference,  the  district  court’s  construc-\ntion  of  the  regulatory  program  made  no  sense.    Id. \n27a-28a (“It would be nonsensical to incorporate into \na  government policy  the  concept  of an  ‘industry-wide \nnegotiated’  price  and  require  vitamin  C  manufactur-\ners to comply with that minimum price point if there \nwere  no  directive  to  agree  upon  such  a  price.”).  The \ncourt  added  that  the  district  court  had  erred  in  sev-\neral other respects as well: \n\nFirst,  it  determined  that  whether  Chinese \nlaw  compelled  Defendants’  anticompetitive \nconduct depended in part on whether Defend-\nants  petitioned  the  Chinese  Government  to \napprove and sanction such conduct. Second, it \nrelied  on  evidence  that  China’s  price-fixing \nlaws  were  not  enforced  to  conclude  that  Chi-\nna’s price-fixing laws did not exist. And third, \nit  determined  that  if  Chinese  law  did  not \ncompel  the  exact  anticompetitive  conduct  al-\nleged in the complaint, then there was no true \nconflict. \n\nId. 30a.  The Second Circuit’s disapproval of these er-\nrors, wholly apart from the standard of negative def-\nerence  the  district  court  employed,  negate  any  argu-\nment that the Second Circuit intended to endorse the \ndistrict court’s analysis. \n\n3.  The  district  court’s  disrespectful  approach \n\nshould be rejected in any event.   \n\nAs  discussed  above  (pp.  38-39),  the  district \ncourt  acknowledged  that  “the  Chinese  law  and  regu-\nlatory regime that defendants rely on is something of \na departure from the concept of ‘law’ as we know it in \nthis  country  —  that  is,  a  published  series  of  specific \nconduct-dictating prohibitions or compulsions with an",
        "47 \n\nidentified  sanctions  system.”  Pet.  App.  116a.    Never-\ntheless,  the  court  proceeded  to  reach  conclusions  in-\nconsistent  with  the  counsel  of  those  in  the  best  posi-\ntion  to  provide  direction,  the  Ministry  and  the  ex-\nperts.23  Contrary to the positions taken by amici AAI \nand  Clarke  and  Howson,  the  difficulty  of  construing \ncomplex  foreign  regulations  counsels  greater,  not \nless, reliance on the submissions of the relevant gov-\nernments  –  the  people  responsible  for  administering \nthe  regulations  –  when  available.  See  Stephen  Brey-\ner, THE COURT AND THE WORLD: AMERICAN LAW AND \nTHE  NEW  GLOBAL  REALITIES  92  (2015).  The  district \ncourt’s  faulty  analysis  in  this  case  provides  an  excel-\nlent example. \n\nThe  district  court’s  construction  of  the  regula-\n\ntory  provisions  in  issue  rendered  them  incoherent.  \nAs discussed above, under the court’s construction: \n\n•  The companies were obligated to report “indus-\ntry-wide  negotiated  prices”  but  “defendants \nhad  the  power  to  effectively  suspend  verifica-\ntion  and  chop  simply  by  not  reaching  any \nagreements  in  the  first  instance.”    Pet.  App. \n125a-26a. \n\n•  The  2002  suspension  provision  authorized  the \nChamber  and  Customs  to  suspend  PVC,  but \nthe court found defendants had the “unilateral \n\n23 As  the  court  noted  on  summary  judgment,  “Plaintiffs  do  not \nhave  a  Chinese  law  expert[.]”    Pet.  App.  59a  n.5.    (Petitioners \noffered a declaration from an American professor criticizing the \nweight  of  certain  documents  at  the  motion  to  dismiss  stage, \nJA119-26,  but  did  not  offer  any  expert  testimony  on  what  Chi-\nnese law required at any stage.)  Respondents presented expert \ntestimony  from  Professor  Shen  Sibao  and  Professor  James  B. \nSpeta.  JA134-79;  CAJA370-406.    Their  testimony  was  unrebut-\nted.",
        "48 \n\nauthority to suspend verification and chop,” id. \n124a  (emphasis  added),  rendering  the  Cham-\nber’s regulatory regime a nullity.  The court al-\nso  concluded  that  the  suspension  provision \ncontinued  in  2003  despite  nothing  in  any  doc-\nument or testimony to that effect. Id. 124a-25a. \n•  “[I]f all the members simply resigned from the \nSubcommittee.  .  .  .  there  would  be  no  price  or \noutput  restrictions  that  [non-members]  would \nbe required to follow.”  Id. 135a.  \n\nJust as the court of appeals determined, id. 27a-28a, \nunder  the  district  court’s  construction,  the  entire  re-\ngime  supervised  by  the  Ministry  and  the  Chamber \nwas unworkable and made no sense.   \n\nIn  contrast,  the  interpretation  provided by the \nMinistry made perfect sense:  Vitamin C exports were \nsubject  to  a  system  under  which  the  exporters  were \nrequired  to  reach  voluntary  “industry-wide  agree-\nments”  on  price,  without  government  involvement  in \ndetermining  the  specific  prices,  and  then  submit  the \nprices to the Chamber and Customs for verification in \norder  to  receive  the  “chop”  required  to  export.    The \nChinese  system  may  (and  certainly  does)  vary  from \nhow Western nations would approach the issues, but \nthe  system  is  coherent,  internally  consistent,  and \nachieves  China’s  policy  goals.    All  this  is  clear  from \nreading  the  applicable  regulations  themselves  –  but \nwas also carefully explained to just this effect by the \nMinistry.  Id. 189a-223a; JA127-33, 247-51. \n\nThe  district  court  asserted  repeatedly  that  a \nnumber of the terms in the regulatory materials and \nthe  company documents  were  susceptible  of  differing \ninterpretations.  See,  e.g.,  Pet.  App.  120a  (penalties \nunder  self-discipline),  124a  (suspension  provision), \n126a-27a (applicability of PVC to output restrictions),",
        "49 \n\n128a (requirement to specify prices and quantities to \nreceive  a  chop).    But  rather  than  rely  on  the  sources \nwho would know, i.e., the Ministry (or the experts or \nthe  commentators),  to  address  these  perceived  ambi-\nguities, and rather than interpret the regulatory sys-\ntem  as  one  that  was  workable  and  made  sense,  the \ncourt  simply  reached  outcomes  in  every  instance  fa-\nvorable  to  the  Petitioners  and  adverse  to  China  and \nthe Respondents. \n\nlaw.  One  key  example \n\nBy  bypassing  the  Ministry,  the  district  court \nfound itself making up its own interpretation of criti-\ncal Chinese terms that have no counterpart in Ameri-\nis  “industry  self-\ncan \ndiscipline.”  The  court’s  determination  that  industry \nself-discipline  reflected  an  absence  of  government \ncompulsion  was  contrary  to  any  plausible  reading  of \nthe  plain  language  of  the  regulatory  provisions,  and \nto  the  unanimous  views  of  the  Ministry,  the  expert \ntestimony,  and  independent  commentators  that  self-\ndiscipline  is  a  government  mandate  for  industry \nmembers to go out and reach “voluntary” agreements \non  prices  and  volumes.    Compare  Pet.  App.  79a-80a \nwith pp. 6-7 above. \n\nThe  district  court’s  stated  reason  for  rejecting \nnearly  everything  the  Ministry  had  to  say  was  that \nthe Ministry statements did not cite every regulation \nand did not anticipate the court’s questions and criti-\ncisms.  Pet. App. 119a-22a. But as the advisory com-\nmittee  note  to  Rule  44.1  provides,  “[o]rdinarily  the \ncourt  should  inform  the  parties  of  material  it  has \nfound  diverging  substantially  from  the  material \nwhich  they  have  presented;  and  in  general  the  court \nshould give the parties an opportunity to analyze and \ncounter  new  points  upon  which  it  proposes  to  rely.” \nFED.

REV.  1281,  1296  (1952).  \nThe  district  court  expressly  declined  to  follow  that \nprocedure  here,  giving  neither  Respondents  nor  the \nMinistry  the  opportunity  to  address  the  court’s  con-\ncerns.  Pet. App. 97a & n.24.  It did not even hold oral \nargument on summary judgment. \n\nNotwithstanding  its  rejection  of  the  Ministry, \nthe  district  court  cited  no  provision  of  Chinese  law \nsupporting  its  manner  of  construing  the  regulations \nin  issue.    Its  ruling  even  defied  basic  U.S.  canons  of \nconstruction  –  that  regulations  should  not  be  inter-\npreted  in  a  manner  that  defies  the  plain  meaning  of \nthe terms, that makes no sense, that would defeat the \npurpose of the regulations, or that fails to give effect \nto all of the regulations’ terms.

REGARDLESS  OF  THE  LEVEL  OF  DEFERENCE, \nTHE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE AFFIRMED \n\n1.  In  the  end,  the  level  of  deference  should \nmake no difference.  The Second Circuit’s standard is \nnot  one  of  conclusive  deference  in  all  circumstances, \nand  its  standard  is  entirely  proper.    But  even  if  the \nstandard were one of no deference, as if the Ministry \nhad not even appeared, there is only one appropriate",
        "51 \n\noutcome:  dismissal  of  the  complaints  on  the  basis  of \ninternational comity.24 \n\nA  judgment  of  affirmance  is  therefore in  order \neven  if  the  Second  Circuit’s  standard  is  modified  in \nsome  way.    This  question  of  the  proper  disposition \nhere  has  been  argued  by  Petitioners  (Pet.  Br.  57-59) \nand  by  a  few  of  Petitioners’  amici  (e.g.,  AAI  Br.  12-\n16).    Addressing  that  question  is  consistent  with  the \nCourt’s  opinions  in  a  number  of  related  contexts, \nwhere  it  disagreed  with  the  standard  applied  below \nbut affirmed after applying the correct standard.  See \nMonsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, \n765-68  (1984);  Kiobel,  569  U.S.  at  108;  Knight  v. \nComm’r  of  Internal  Revenue,  552  U.S.  181  (2008); \nUnited States v. Tinklenberg, 563 U.S. 647 (2011).   \n\n2.  In  considering  whether  to  dismiss  on  the \nbasis of international comity, the sole issue presented \nto the court of appeals was whether Chinese law was \nin  conflict  with  the  Sherman  Act.    Cf.  Hartford  Fire \nIns.  Co.  v.  California,  509  U.S.  764,  798-99  (1993).  \nThe  court  found  that  the  other  factors  “decidedly \nweigh in favor of dismissal,” Pet. App. 34a, and Peti-\ntioners never contested the point.  Annex B. \n\n Petitioners and AAI advance three arguments \nas to why the conduct in issue here was not compelled \nand,  therefore,  that  there  was  no  conflict  between \nChinese and U.S. law.  None has merit. \n\ni.  The first argument is that, because par-\nticipation  in  the  subcommittee  was  “voluntary”  and \ncould  be  terminated,  there  could  be  no  compulsion.  \n\n24 Comity  is  the  only  one  of  Respondents’  defenses  before  this \nCourt.  The court of appeals had no need to reach any of the oth-\ner issues raised by Respondents on appeal.  Pet. App. 37a-38a.",
        "52 \n\nPet.  Br.  8-12;  AAI  Br.  11-15.    There  is nothing,  how-\never, to indicate that participation by the four leading \nmanufacturers  –  as  distinguished  from  the  newly-\nadded  members  –  was  voluntary  in  any  meaningful \nsense.  The four were all Council members appointed \nfor four year terms with no provision for termination, \nand  the  only  evidence  in  the  record  was  that  they \ncould not withdraw as a practical matter.   See pp. 9-\n10 above.   \n\nEven so, the idea that everyone could refuse to \njoin,  resign,  or  decline  to  reach  agreements  in  the \nfirst  instance  fails  as  well.    That  argument  would \nrender  the  entire  regulatory  regime  a  nullity.    The \nplain  language  of  the  regulations  required  submis-\nsion  of  “industry-wide negotiated  prices,”  JA99,  a  re-\nquirement  that  would  make  no  sense  absent  the  re-\nquirement  to  arrive  at  an  industry-wide  negotiated \nprice.    Pet.  App.  28a.  And  non-members  were  bound \nto  the  industry-wide  negotiated  prices  even  if  they \ndid not participate. JA105-06. \n\nThe ability to withdraw makes no difference in \nany  event.    Just  as  the  ability  to  withdraw  is  no  de-\nfense  in  an  action  for  price-fixing,  e.g.,  United  States \nv. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 615 (2d Cir. 2003); Unit-\ned  States  v.  Hayter  Oil  Co.,  51  F.3d  1265,  1271  (6th \nCir.  1995),  that  ability  cannot  negate  the  fact  that \nChina required a violation of the Sherman Act.  And, \nto  repeat,  withdrawing  members  were  still  bound  by \nthe Chamber’s coordinated prices anyway.  JA106. \n\nPetitioners  effectively  concede  that  the  1997 \nregulatory  regime  compelled  the  companies  to  fix \nprices and limit output.  See, e.g., Pet. Br. 5-6, 8.  But \nthey  identify  nothing  in  the  2002-03  notices,  an-\nnouncements, charters, or anything else that changed \nthe  obligation  to  coordinate  price  and  output,  under",
        "53 \n\nthe  Chamber’s  supervision,  in  furtherance  of  indus-\ntrial self-discipline.  Those obligations – and thus the \ncompelled  violation  of  the  Sherman  Act  –  continued \nin full force.  JA53-55, 99-100, 105-06, 183. \n\nii.  Petitioners  and  AAI  assert  that  Re-\nspondents exceeded the “scope” of governmental com-\npulsion  by  agreeing  on  prices  higher  than  anti-\ndumping  minima,  and  by  agreeing  on  output  limita-\ntions, not just price.  Pet. Br. 58 n.19; AAI Br. 12-13. \n\nAs  to  the  scope  of  the  compulsion,  the  govern-\nmental  directive  was  for  the  companies  to  reach \nagreements on prices voluntarily, without having the \ngovernment set a particular price.  See pp. 7-11 above.  \nThe  obligation  was  to  agree  on prices  by  themselves, \nsee  JA55,  not  to  charge  some  dictated  price.    Re-\nspondents  acted  entirely  within  the  scope  of  that \ncompulsion,  and  that  was  what  was  in  conflict  with \nthe Sherman Act.  It has long been bedrock that “con-\nspiracies  under  the  Sherman  Act  are  not  dependent \non  any  overt  act  other  than  the  act  of  conspiring,” \nUnited  States  v.  Socony-Vacuum  Oil  Co.,  310  U.S. \n150,  224  n.59  (1940),  that  “[a]ny  combination  which \ntampers  with  price  structures  is  engaged  in  an  un-\nlawful  activity,”  id.  at  221,  and  that  the  price  level \nestablished does not matter, United States v. Trenton \nPotteries  Co.,  273  U.S.  392,  397-98  (1927);  see  Plym-\nouth  Dealers’  Ass’n  v.  United  States,  279  F.2d  128, \n132  (9th  Cir.  1960)  (“agreed  starting  point”  for  price \nnegotiations  sufficient  to  establish  violation).    Peti-\ntioners and AAI ignore these principles.  \n\nThe  output  argument,  Pet.  Br.  11-12,  fails  as \nwell.  Coordination on output was required under the \n2002  PVC  regime.    The  companies  were  obligated  to \nspecify  to  the  Chamber  “the  prices  and  quantities” \nand the Chamber was required to “verify the submis-",
        "54 \n\nsions  by  the  exporters  based  on  the  industry  agree-\nments.”  JA105;  see  JA59;  CAJA2216-17.    Moreover, \nas  this  Court  has  often  explained,  price  and  output \nare  economically  (and  legally)  the  same.    See  Cal. \nDental  Ass’n  v.  FTC,  526  U.S.  756,  777  (1999)  (“An \nagreement  on  output  also  equates  to  a  price-fixing \nagreement.”)  (quoting  General  Leaseways,  Inc.  v. \nNat’l Truck Leasing Ass’n,  744  F.2d  588,  594-95  (7th \nCir. 1984)); Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson \nTobacco  Corp.,  509  U.S.  209,  233  (1993)  (“Su-\npracompetitive  pricing  entails  a  restriction  in  out-\nput.”).    Compelling  price-fixing  is  compelling  agree-\nments  on  output.    Although  the  Chinese  regulations \nspoke primarily about price, their scope encompassed \noutput (as they would have to), and the Chamber su-\npervised  production  quantities  throughout  the  rele-\nvant  period.    See  JA180,  242,  367,  435.    Requiring \ncompanies  to  fix  prices  without  regard  to  output \nwould have made no sense. \n\niii. Petitioners  also  note  the  difficulties  the \nChamber  sometimes  had  in  enforcing  the  agree-\nments, and the occasional cheating.  Pet. Br. 10-11. \n\nLess-than-complete  enforcement  and  cheating \nhave  nothing  to  do  with  whether  Chinese  law  re-\nquired  the  price-fixing  Petitioners  challenge.    Socony \nconfirmed that the violation is the agreement, not its \nsuccess,  and  the  courts  have  consistently  held  that \ncheating is not a defense to a price-fixing charge. See \nUnited States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 679 (7th Cir. \n2000)  (“[C]artel  members  cheated  each  other  when \nthey  could[.]”);  Hayter,  51  F.3d  at  1274-75;  accord \nPet.  App.  32a  (“[I]nquiring into  whether  the  Chinese \nGovernment actually enforced the PVC regime as ap-\nplied  to  vitamin  C  exports  confuses  the  question  of \nwhat Chinese law required with whether the vitamin",
        "55 \n\nC regulations were enforced.”).  Just as cheating can-\nnot negate the existence of an agreement to fix prices, \nit equally cannot change what Chinese law required. \n\nThe  Chamber  did  its  best  to  enforce  the  re-\n\nquirement to coordinate price and output.  JA434-36.  \nIt  is  not  surprising,  however,  that  enforcement \nproved  to  be  difficult.    China  was  moving  from  a \ncommand economy to one in which more private own-\nership was permitted, and companies were experienc-\ning  competition  under  regulation  for  the  first  time.  \n“Cheating”  on price-fixing  arrangements  is  prevalent \nand often economically rational even in the most ma-\nture  economies.    See  2B  PHILLIP  E.  AREEDA  &  HER-\nBERT  HOVENKAMP,  ANTITRUST  LAW  ¶  405b  (4th  ed. \n2014).    That  it  was  observed  in  China’s  nascent  “so-\ncialist  market  economy”  is  neither  surprising  nor  a \nbasis  for  denying  the  compulsory  nature  of  China’s \nregulatory regime. \n\n3.   The  internal  company  documents  cited  by \nPetitioners  do  not  change  the  outcome.    Complaints \nabout  company  noncompliance  with  output  reduc-\ntions,  statements  occurring  in  unrelated  contexts \nsuch  as  “only  honest  fellows  will follow,”  Pet.  Br.  12-\n14,25 and  the  suggestion  that  defendants  need  to  act \n“in a more hidden way” following the initiation of this \nlawsuit, id. 16, have nothing to do with what Chinese \nlaw in fact required.  Disputes about rival compliance \n\n25 The  relevant  passage  describes  general  complaints  about  “il-\nlegal  or  sub-standard  drug  producers”  whose  products  raised \nsafety  concerns.    It  is  not  about  price  coordination  and  is  not \nspecific  to  Vitamin  C.    JA454,  603.    It  was  about  getting  the \nChamber greater authority to “punish companies who engage in \nsmuggling,  tax  evasion  or  who  have  little  credibility”  and  to \n“honor those who are trustworthy” to improve the “credibility” of \nChinese pharmaceutical products.  JA455.",
        "56 \n\nwith  price-fixing  agreements,  and  the  nervous  reac-\ntions  of  Chinese  nationals  sued  for  vast  sums  under \nunfamiliar laws in a country 6800 miles away are not \nsurprising.    Much  less  do  they  suggest  that  price-\nfixing was not required under Chinese law. \n\n4.  In  this  Court,  in  addressing  comity  absten-\ntion,  the  government  criticizes  the  court  of  appeals \nfor  giving  “inadequate  weight  to  the  interests  of  the \nU.S.  victims  .  .  .  and  to  the  interests  of  the  United \nStates  in  enforcement  of  its  laws.”    U.S.  Br.  32  n.8.  \nAs  Petitioners  raised  no  such  arguments  below,  it \nseems  unfair  to  criticize  the  Second  Circuit  for  not \naddressing  them.  But  even  if  the  points  had  been \nraised, they would not properly have affected the out-\ncome. \n\nPlaintiffs’ interests in collecting money and the \nU.S. national interest in enforcing the antitrust laws \nare  present  in  every private  antitrust  case.    There  is \nnothing  unique  about  those  interests  here.    In  con-\ntrast,  the  other  relevant  considerations  are  unique:  \ndefendants were all Chinese companies; all the activi-\nty  took  place  in  China  under  China’s  regulatory  re-\ngime; China has repeatedly explained the importance \nof this case, and has protested the district court’s dis-\nposition  through  official  diplomatic  channels.    The \nconsiderations  favoring  dismissal,  therefore,  are  at \ntheir zenith.  To argue that they are overcome by the \ntypical  interests  at  issue  in  every  case,  whether  do-\nmestic or international, is to argue comity dismissals \nare never appropriate.  This Court has never said any \nsuch  thing,  and  specifically  declined  certiorari  to  ad-\ndress that argument when agreeing to hear this case.  \nSee Pet. i; cf. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 812-22 (Scal-\nia, J., dissenting in relevant part, joined by O’Connor,",
        "57 \n\nKennedy,  and  Thomas,  JJ.)  (endorsing  principle  of \ncomity abstention which majority declined to reach). \n\nAs the case now stands, the only issue on comi-\nty  abstention  is  whether  Chinese law  conflicted  with \nthe  Sherman  Act.   See  id.  at 798  (whether there  is  a \n“true conflict” is the “only substantial question in this \nlitigation”).   The  court  of  appeals  correctly concluded \nthat  it  did.    See  Michael  N.  Sohn  &  Jesse  Solomon, \nLingering Questions on Foreign Sovereignty and Sep-\naration  of  Powers  After  the  Vitamin  C  Price-Fixing \nVerdict, 28 ANTITRUST 78 (Fall 2013). \n\n5.  As  the  court  of  appeals  recognized,  Peti-\ntioners’  arguments  amount  to  an  attack  on  China’s \nchoice of regulatory system and the manner in which \nit was implemented and enforced.  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  \nThe  requirement  to  fix  prices  was  stated  unambigu-\nously  in  the  regulatory  documents,  as  was the  struc-\nture  of  the  PVC  enforcement  mechanism.    By  ques-\ntioning  the  level  of  enforcement  by  Chinese  officials, \nand demanding that they do more than they did, Pe-\ntitioners  impermissibly  seek  to  invalidate  “the  effect \nof  official  action  by  a  foreign  sovereign.”  W.S.  Kirk-\npatrick & Co. v. Envt’l Tectonics Corp., 493 U.S. 400, \n406  (1990).  Courts  of  the  United  States  do  not  tell \nforeign  nations  how  to  enforce  their  own  laws,  Un-\nderhill, 168 U.S. at 252-54, and a private class action \ncase  is  not  a  proper  vehicle  for  invalidating  China’s \nmethod of regulating the export of Vitamin C.   \n\nAs  Circuit  Judge  Ginsburg  and  John  Taladay \n\nput it recently, if antitrust enforcers \n\ndo not apply comity in the application of their \nlaws and in limiting the extraterritorial scope \nof their remedies, then international competi-\ntion  enforcement  will  quickly  devolve  into  a",
        "58 \n\n“race  to  the  bottom,”  in  which  the  country \nwith  the  most  restrictive  competition  laws \nwill  regulate  commercial  conduct  for  the  en-\ntire world. The effects doctrine is a legitimate \nbasis  upon  which  to  apply  competition  laws \nand  impose  remedies  but,  just  as  an  agency \nconsiders  how  foreign  conduct  affects  its  do-\nmestic  consumers,  it  likewise  should  ensure \nthat  its  remedy  does  not  unnecessarily  affect \nforeign  governments,  agencies,  business  in-\nterests,  or  consumers.  Comity  should  be  in-\nvoked to prevent the effects doctrine from be-\ncoming  a  way  for  one  jurisdiction  to  impose \nits domestic commercial policy on the conduct \nof  businesses  outside  its  borders.  Otherwise \ncompetition  enforcement  turns  from  a  policy \nto protect consumers into a slightly disguised \nway of implementing industrial policy. \n\nDouglas  H.  Ginsburg  &  John  M.

        "A-1\n\nANNEX A \n\nExcerpt from Br. for Plaintiffs-Appellees at 25-26: \n\nAppellants  repeatedly  assert  that  Chinese  law \nmandated  the  challenged  conduct  in  this  case,  but \nChinese  law  only  required  the  Chamber  and  its \nSubcommittee to “actively coordinate to set vitamin C \nexport  prices  and  quantities.”  Br.12.  The  Ministry \nhas made no argument about the specific agreements \nproven at trial. Instead, the Ministry has represented \nthat Subcommittee members were required to engage \nin  a  pre-designated  process  if  called  upon  by  the \nChamber,  but  not  to  reach  any  particular  result.  A-\n205-07.",
        "A-2\n\nANNEX B \n\nPoint II.E of Br. for Plaintiffs-Appellees at 45-46: \n\nE.  DISMISSAL IS NOT REQUIRED AS A MATTER \n\nOF COMITY. \n\nTo  trigger  the  discretionary  comity  doctrine,  a \n“true  conflict”  must  exist  between  U.S.  and  foreign \nlaw  such  that  compliance  with  the  laws  of  both \ncountries  is  impossible.  Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v. \nCalifornia, 509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993). Consistent with \nHartford Fire, foreign law did not require Appellants \n“to  act  in  some  fashion  prohibited  by  the  law  of  the \nUnited  States.”  Id.  at  799.  Appellants  argue  that  a \n“true  conflict”  is  not  required  to  trigger  the  comity \ndoctrine  under  Hartford  Fire,  but  cite  only  two  post-\nHarford  Fire  cases,  neither  of  which  supports  their \nargument. Trugman-Nash, Inc. v. New Zealand Dairy \nBd.,  954  F.  Supp.  733,  736  (S.D.N.Y.  1997)  (true \nconflict  existed);  Metro  Indus.,  Inc.  v.  Sammi  Corp., \n82  F.3d  839,  847  (9th  Cir.  1996)  (no  true  conflict \nexisted). \n\nHere, compliance with both the Sherman Act and \nChinese  law  was  not  only  possible,  it  happened: \nChinese  vitamin  C  manufacturers  did  not  engage  in \nprice fixing prior to the end of 2001; they engaged in \nprice wars until the cartel was formed. A-2005-34; A-\n176  (“Between  May  2000  and  late  December  2001, \nvitamin  C  in  [China]  experienced  the  second  ‘price \nwar’  since  1995”).  The  companies  and  the  Chamber \nalso stopped meeting after 2008. A-1827, lines 2-9. \n\nAppellants  wrongly  claim  the  district  court  held \nthat  Hartford Fire  overruled  O.N.E.

Introduction \n\nChinese  law  compelled  price-fixing  of  Vitamin \nC throughout the relevant period.  That was not only \nthe  conclusion  of  the  court  of  appeals  below.    In  a \nclosely related matter, the World Trade Organization \n(“WTO”),  agreeing  with  the  United  States,  Europe, \nand Mexico, confirmed that “China require[d] export-\ning enterprises to export at set or coordinated export \nprices or otherwise face penalties.”  Chinese law thus \nconflicted directly with the Sherman Act. \n\nIn  this  litigation,  for  the  first  time  in  history, \nChina appeared before an American court as an ami-\ncus curiae.  It did so to describe what was required of \nVitamin  C  manufacturers  under  its  regulatory  sys-\ntem.    China  explained  logically  how  its  regime  com-\nmanded companies to reach coordinated export prices \nas  a  group,  without  the  need  for  the  government  to \ndictate specific prices.  But instead of the respect this \nCourt  has  required  of  the  formal  submissions  of  for-\neign  governments,  the  district  court  effectively  ac-\ncused  China  of  misrepresenting its  system  to  protect \nits  nationals,  based  largely  on  its  plainly  erroneous \nview  that  China’s  representations  to  the  WTO  were \ninconsistent with its submissions in this case.  Reject-\ning China’s statements, the district court interpreted \nthe governing regulations in a way that rendered the \nprovisions incoherent and unworkable.     \n\nThe  court  of  appeals,  properly  exercising  de \nnovo  review,  analyzed  China’s  submissions  and  the \napplicable  regulations.  It  determined  that  China’s \nanalysis was reasonable and reliable, and established \nthat China compelled conduct that conflicted with the \nSherman Act. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nHaving  found  China’s  formal  submissions  to \nhave  been  reasonable,  the  court  held  that  that  the \ndistrict  court  had  erred  by  not  giving  those  submis-\nsions  decisive  weight.    This  “defer  if  reasonable” \nstandard is not a standard of conclusive deference di-\nvorced  from  a  careful  analysis  of  the  foreign  govern-\nment’s submissions.  It is, rather, a standard entirely \nconsistent  with  the  decisions  of  this  Court.  The  deci-\nsion below should be affirmed. \n\nB.  Statement of Facts \n\n1.  From  October  1949,  when  Chairman  Mao \nZedong announced the creation of the People’s Repub-\nlic  of  China,  through  1978,  China  had  a  “command \neconomy.”  Under that system, the State, directed by \nthe Communist Party, operated the significant indus-\ntrial  assets  in  the  economy.    JA137,  142.    In  1978, \nhowever,  under  the  leadership  of  Deng  Xiaoping, \nChina  began  a  transition  into  a  “socialist  market \neconomy,”  under  which  greater  private  ownership \nwas  permitted,  subject  to  a  variety  of  governmental \ncontrols.  Pet. App. 58a-59a; JA139, 142, 171. \n\nThe  transition  to  a  “socialist”  market  economy \nwas  gradual,  reflecting  as  it  did  a  cultural  change.  \nThe  details  of  the  transition  were  not  embodied  in \nspecific statutes and regulations because Chinese law \ndoes  not  work  that  way.    JA140-41;  see  Ignazio  Cas-\ntellucci, Rule of Law with Chinese Characteristics, 13 \nANNUAL SURVEY  OF INT’L & COMP. LAW  35,  37  (2007) \n(China  has  “downplayed  the  role  of  statutes  [and] \nregulations”  in  favor  of  the  “application  of  relatively \nfew, generally drafted legal rules according to the pol-\nicy needs of the political authority”). \n\nNor  is  China’s  “socialist  market  economy”  a \nmarket economy as understood in Western society.  It \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\nis one in which the “government is expected to moni-\ntor  and  control  individual  companies’  market  activi-\nties  on  a  policy  level,  delegating  and  assigning  the \nspecifics  of  regulation  downward.”    JA171.    “Coordi-\nnation”  of  the  actions  of  companies  in  major  indus-\ntries is an important aspect of this control.  “The pur-\npose  of  coordination  is  to  have  domestic  companies \ncompete in the international market as a unity, to . . . \nadvance China’s collective interest.”  Id. \n\n2.  The  governing  agency  controlling  China’s \nexport trade is known today as the Ministry of Com-\nmerce  (sometimes  called  MOFCOM).  The  Ministry’s \norigins  date  back  to  1949,  when  China  established \nthe  Ministry  of  Trade.    JA142.    From  1993  to  2003, \nthe  Ministry  was  referred  to  as  the  Ministry  of  For-\neign  Trade  and  Economic  Co-operation  (“MOFTEC”).  \nIt  was  renamed  MOFCOM  in  2003  following  a  reor-\nganization.  \n\nThe  Ministry  is  a  component  of  the  State \nCouncil  (China’s  central  government)  and  “the  high-\nest authority in China authorized to regulate foreign \ntrade.”    Pet.  App.  57a;  JA141  &  n.1.    “It  has  the  au-\nthority  to  draft  and  implement  trade-related  laws, \nregulations,  policies  and  directives.  [Its]  interpreta-\ntion  of  its  own  regulations  and  policies  carries  deci-\nsive  weight  under  Chinese  law.”    JA141-42;  see  also \nJA782-84.1 \n\n1 The  suggestion  by  Petitioners  (Pet.  Br.  42)  and  amici  Clarke \nand Howson (Br. 17-22) that the Ministry lacks authority to in-\nterpret Chinese law lacks any basis.  China sent the U.S. State \nDepartment  a  diplomatic  note  that  confirms  the  Ministry’s  au-\nthority.    JA783  (referring  to  the  Ministry’s  submissions  as  “a \nstatement by a foreign government”). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f4 \n\nSince 1989, the Ministry has regulated the ex-\nport  of  Vitamin  C  and  other  medicinal  products \nthrough the Chamber of Commerce of Medicines and \nHealth  Products  Importers  &  Exporters  (“the  Cham-\nber”).    CAJA685.  The  Chamber  is  called  a “social  or-\nganization,” but that English translation of a Chinese \nterm  of  art  can  be  deceptive.  It  exercises  delegated \nregulatory power and acts as an arm of the Ministry.  \nSee  CAJA747,  3715-17;  Pet.  App.  72a-73a,  118a-19a \nn.37.  At all relevant times, its function was to “coor-\ndinate  import  and  export  business  in  Chinese  and \nWestern  medicines”  by  implementing  government \npolicies  and  regulations under  “the  guidance  and  su-\npervision  of  the  responsible  departments  under  the \nStat[e]  Council.”    CAJA412  (Chamber  statement, \n2003).  “Coordinating price, market and clients of for-\neign trade” were among these responsibilities. Id.   \n\nThe  Chamber is  one  of  several  chambers  over-\nseen  by  the  Ministry.    As  the  United  States  has  ex-\nplained, “China’s Chambers of Commerce are organi-\nzations representing private members that also func-\ntion  as  entities  under  MOFCOM’s  direct  and  active \nsupervision  and,  accordingly,  play  a  central  role  in \nregulating  the  trade  of  China’s  industries.”    First \nWritten Submission of the United States of America, \nChina – Measures Related to the Exportation of Vari-\nous  Raw  Materials,  WT/DS394,  WT/DS395, \nWT/DS398  ¶  207  (June  1,  2010),  available  at \ngoo.gl/sxyv43 (“US-WTO Submission”). \n\n3.  In 1997, the Ministry instituted a regulato-\nry system for the production and export of Vitamin C. \nIn conjunction with the State Drug Administration, it \nissued  the  “1997  Notice,”  JA89-97,  under  which  Vit-\namin  C  production  was  to  be  “strictly  controlled.”  \nJA90.   Under  the  Notice,  the  Chamber  was  to  estab-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f5 \n\nlish  a  “Vitamin  C  Coordination  Group,”  later  known \nas  the  Vitamin  C  Subcommittee.  The  Subcommittee \nwas  a  branch  of  the  Chamber,  not  a  separate  entity.  \nJA80.    Its  main  responsibilities  were  “to  coordinate \nwith  respect  to  Vitamin  C  export  market,  price  and \ncustomers.”  JA92.  Its members were the four major \nChinese  Vitamin  C  manufacturers,  Northeast    Phar-\nmaceutical  Group  Co.,  Ltd.,  Jiangsu  Jiangshan \nPharmaceutical  Co.  Ltd.,  Weisheng  Pharmaceutical \nCo.  Ltd.,  and  Respondent  Hebei  Welcome  Pharma-\nceutical  Co.,  Ltd.  (“Welcome”),  JA422,  and  it  was \nchaired by an officer of the Chamber, Mr. Qiao Haili.  \nThe  four  companies  were  all  required  to  participate \nin  the  Subcommittee  “and  subject  themselves  to  the \ncoordination of the Group.”  JA92.2 \n\nThe Subcommittee’s 1997 charter conformed to \nthe  Ministry’s  directive.    It  explained  that  the  Sub-\ncommittee  was  to  “coordinate  and  administ[er]  mar-\nket, price, customer and operation order of Vitamin C \nexport,”  and  to  “hold  .  .  .  working  meetings  for  Vita-\nmin  C  export  to  exchange  information,  summarize \nand  communicate  experience,  analyze  and  work  out \ncoordinated prices for Vitamin C export, to supervise \nand  inspect  the  implementation  of  such  coordinated \nexport  prices  [set]  by  the  Sub-Committee.”   JA82-83.  \nFor  violations,  members  were  subject  to  “warning \n[and] open criticism” – a severe penalty in the Maoist \n\n2  Respondent  North  China  Pharmaceutical  Group  Corp. \n(“NCPG”)  is  a  state-owned  holding  company  and  the  indirect \nparent  corporation  of  Welcome.    CAJA195.    It  consistently  dis-\nputed the personal jurisdiction of the U.S. courts over it, as well \nas any liability for Welcome’s Vitamin C activities.  CAJA195-98.  \nThe court of appeals had no need to reach the issues specific to \nNCPG given its disposition of the case.  Pet.

JA85-86. \n\nThe Subcommittee was also responsible for the \nChamber’s  “export  administration.”    Specifically,  it \nwas required to “supervise the implementation of ex-\nport license[s] by member enterprises and advis[e] on \nallocation and adjustment of [export] quota, and issu-\nance of export license.”  JA82. \n\n4.  Beginning  in  2002,  the  means  of  enforcing \nprice coordination changed, but the requirement that \nthe  companies  coordinate  export  prices  through  the \nChamber and the Subcommittee did not. \n\nIn  December  2001,  anticipating  the  forthcom-\ning changes, the Chamber convened a meeting of the \nfour manufacturers.  As directed by the Chamber, the \ncompanies  agreed  to  export  volume  limitations  and \nthe Chamber made clear that “[t]he committed export \nvolume as part of the industry self-discipline shall be \nstrictly implemented,” adding that companies “not in \nstrict  compliance  with  this  requirement  will  be  pun-\nished by the Vitamin C Sub-Committee.”  JA459. \n\n“Self-discipline” is a “regulatory process that is \nwell-understood  and  applied  broadly  in  China.”  \nJA138.   “That  process,  by design,  involved communi-\ncations  among  the  relevant  parties  with  a  goal  of \nseeking  agreement  on a  unified  course  of  action  that \nwould implement the mandatory goals of Chinese pol-\nicy[.]”    JA138-39,  174-78.

JA98-101.  It provided: \n\n•  The  objective  was  “to  adjust  the  catalogue  of \nexport  products  subject  to  price  review  by  the \ncustoms  for  year  2002,  in  order  to  accommo-\ndate the new situations since China’s entry in-\nto WTO, maintain the order of market competi-\ntion, make active efforts to avoid anti-dumping \nsanctions . . . , promote industry self-discipline \nand  facilitate  the  healthy  development  of  ex-\nports.”  JA99. \n\n•  Vitamin C and 29 other products were now sub-\nject  “to  price  review  by  the  customs”  under  a \n“Price Verification and Chop (‘PVC’)” procedure.  \nId. \n\n4 Cf.

JA102-\n06.  The 2002 Notice had given the various chambers \nand  Customs  the  ability  to  “suspend  export  price  re-\nview for certain products” if the relevant subcommit-\ntee  members  approved.    JA100.    This  provision, \nwhich  was  never  invoked,  was  not  continued  in  the \n2003 Announcement.  JA102-06. \n\nThe 2003 Announcement provided that:  (i) the \nChamber “shall be responsible for implementing” the \nPVC system; (ii) exporters were to specify in the con-\ntracts  “the  prices  and  quantities”;  (iii)  the  Chamber \nwas required to “verify the submissions . . . based on \nthe industry agreements,” “affix V&C chop to the con-\nforming  applications,”  and  send  them  back  to  the \ncompanies for transmission to Customs.  JA104-06. \n\nIn  connection  with  the  2003  Announcement, \nthe  Chamber  revised  its  Charter.    JA53-78.    It  con-\ntinued  as  “a  national-wide  and  self-disciplined  social \nentity voluntarily organized . . . with objectives of the \ntrade coordination and service.”  JA53.  “The objective \nof  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  is  to  coordinate  and \nguide  the  import  and  export  of  medicines  and health \nproducts[.]”  JA54.  Its duties continued to include the \nobligation to “jointly maintain the order of the import \nand export [and to] coordinate the import and export \nprices, market and clients.”  JA55. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f9 \n\nThe Subcommittee also revised its charter and \nadministrative  rules.    One  change  was  that,  in  addi-\ntion  to  the  four  major  Vitamin  C  manufacturers  – \nwho  were now  referred  to  as  “Council  Members”  and \n“Member  Organizations”;  JA197,  461  –  the  Subcom-\nmittee  added  11  non-manufacturer  export  trading \ncompanies  and  smaller  manufacturers  as  “member \nenterprises.”    JA462-63;  CAJA2216-17.    Their  addi-\ntion was consistent with the elimination of the discre-\ntionary  (or  “non-automatic”)  license  requirement  for \nexporters.  See pp. 12, 16, 40 below. \n\nThe  Subcommittee’s  coordination  duties  con-\ntinued as before.  The new Charter provided that the \nSubcommittee  would  continue  to  “coordinate  and \nguide  vitamin  C  import  and  export  business  activi-\nties,  promote  self-discipline  in  the  industry,”  as  well \nas  to  “maintain  the  normal  order  for  vitamin  C”  ex-\nports,  and  to  “protect  the  interests  of  the  state,  the \nindustry  and  its  members.”  JA183  (art.  8).    It  con-\nfirmed that: “The Subcommittee will discipline mem-\nbers  [for]  .  .  .  [f]ailure  to  carry  out  industrial  agree-\nments[.]”  JA467-68.    Consistently,  the  Ministry’s \nformal approval in 1997 of the Chamber’s Vitamin C \nSubcommittee,  JA79-80,  including  the  obligation  to \n“coordinat[e] the Vitamin C export market, price and \ncustomers  of  China,”  JA79,  was  never  superseded \nand continued in full force and effect.  JA420.5  \n\nThe  revised  Charter  also  said  that  the  Sub-\ncommittee was “a self-disciplinary industry organiza-\n\n5 Petitioners’  assertion  that  the  2002  Notice  “abolished”  the  re-\nquirement  to  fix  prices,  Pet.  Br.  8,  is  unsupported  and  inaccu-\nrate.    The  2002  Notice  unambiguously  required  companies  to \ncoordinate and arrive at industry-wide negotiated prices as part \nof industry self-discipline.  JA99-100. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f10 \n\ntion jointly established on a voluntary basis,” JA182, \nand  that  members  had  a  right  “to  freely  resign.”  \nJA186.    Council  members,  however,  including  the \nfour  leading  manufacturers,  were  selected  to  four-\nyear  terms,  JA190,  197,  and  there  was  no  provision \nallowing  a  Council  member  to  resign  its  post.    Thus, \nas “a practical matter,” none of the four major manu-\nfacturers  could  abandon  participation.    JA431.    And \nnone ever did. \n\nExporters  who  were  not  members  of  the  Sub-\n\ncommittee  were  bound by  the  same  PVC  procedures.  \nJA106  (“For  V&C  applications  made  by  non-member \nexporters,  the  Chambers  shall  give  them  the  same \ntreatment  as  to  member  exporters.”).    Consequently, \nall  exporters  were  required  to  adhere  to  the  coordi-\nnated prices set by the Chamber’s members. \n\nUnder  the  revised  2002  regime,  as  before,  ex-\nport prices were not set by the Ministry or the Cham-\nber;  they  were  largely  “fixed  by  enterprises  without \ngovernment  intervention.”    Pet.  Br.  10.    What  China \ncontinued  to  require  was  that  the  companies  them-\nselves  fix  the  prices  under  the  supervision  of  the \nChamber and its Subcommittee; the obligation was to \nreach  “voluntary”  agreements  on  prices  through  in-\ndustrial self-discipline.  JA139.  The prices agreed on \nwere  up  to  the  companies  so  long  as  they  exceeded \nanti-dumping  minima.    JA175-77  (“Properly  under-\nstood,  what  the  government  is  compelling  is  the  ac-\ntive  participation  of  the  industry  in  a  mandated  pro-\ncess which must be obeyed.”); see JA105, 183. \n\nThe changes from the 1997 regime to the 2002 \nregime  were  modest.    Non-manufacturing  trading \ncompanies  and  smaller  manufacturers  could  join  the \nSubcommittee,  and  several  did.    Members  were  per-\nmitted to resign; but there is no evidence that any ev-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f11 \n\ner did, and non-members were bound by the same re-\nquirements in any event.  The major change was that \nexport quota restrictions and non-automatic licensing \nwere  eliminated  and  replaced  by  the  PVC  system.  \nJA167-68, 428-30; CAJA3898-99; see also CAJA2012.  \nWhat did not change was the requirement to fix pric-\nes.  The companies remained obligated under PVC to \nengage in industrial self-discipline, to accept the price \ncoordination managed by the Chamber, and to report \nindustry-wide  negotiated  prices  under  Chamber \nguidance.  Price coordination through industrial self-\ndiscipline thus continued as before.  See CAJA2154. \n\n5.  Price-fixing  agreements  are  notoriously  dif-\nficult to monitor and enforce, see George J. Stigler, A \nTheory  of  Oligopoly,  72  J.  POL.  ECON.  44,  44-48 \n(1964),  and  that  is  especially  so  in  a  developing  na-\ntion where the government had controlled all aspects \nof production until the recent past. \n\nStill, PVC was enforced.  The Chamber denied \nchops  to  nonconforming  contracts,  JA434-35,  and  di-\nrected  production  limitations  to  stabilize  prices.  \nJA435.    In  a  few  instances,  manufacturers  initially \ndid  not  follow  a  requirement  to  curtail  production, \nbut  they  were  later  brought  into  compliance.  JA180-\n81,  435-36.  Contracts  were  inspected  by  the  Cham-\nber,  which  “refused  to  affix  our  chop  to  non-\nconforming contracts.”  JA436; see CAJA1767-68.6   \n\n6.  China “acceded” to the World Trade Organ-\nization  in  2001.    In  doing  so,  it  “gave  up  export  ad-\n\n6  Petitioners  assert  that  PVC  was  not  “mandatory”  because \nmany of the contracts produced in discovery had no chop. Pet. Br. \n11.    But  the  process  was  for  the  companies  to  transmit  the \nchopped contracts  to  Customs.   JA105;  Pet.  App.  244a.   No  dis-\ncovery was taken from Customs. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f12 \n\nministration”  of  Vitamin  C.    JA319.    China  did  not \ngive  up  the  requirement  of  industry  self-discipline, \nnor  the  companies’  obligation  to  reach  industry-wide \nprice  agreements  under  Chamber  coordination.    The \n“export  administration”  China  abandoned,  instead, \nwas  the  regime  of  export  quotas  and  non-automatic \nexport  licensing  for  Vitamin  C  that  China  had  fol-\nlowed prior to 2002.  Id.; JA90, 160, 162, 165, 428-29.  \n\nPolicy  Review \n\nThat  is  what  the  United  States  and  the  WTO \nthemselves  concluded.   See  US-WTO  Submission  ¶¶ \n90-109.  The WTO’s trade reviews all determined that \nwhat  China  had  given  up  in  abandoning  export  ad-\nministration was non-automatic licenses and exporter \nquotas,  not  price  coordination  by  the  Chambers.  See \nWTO,  China  Trade \n2006, \nWT/TPR/S/161, at 104 ¶ 141 & n.120 (Feb. 28, 2006), \navailable  at  goo.gl/H97MgH  (“On  1  January  2002, \nChina  abolished  export  quotas  and  licences  for  .  .  . \nVitamin  C.”);  WTO, Transitional Review Under Arti-\ncle 18 of the Protocol of Accession of the People’s Re-\npublic of China,  G/C/W/438,  at  2-3  ¶  5(a)  (Nov.  20, \n2002),  available at goo.gl/uu7k71.    Contrary  to  the \narguments of Petitioners and some of their amici, e.g., \nPet. Br. 9, 19, 53, China’s representation to the WTO \nthat  it  was  giving  up  export  administration  of  Vita-\nmin C was thus entirely consistent with its continued \nrequirement of price-fixing. \n\n7.  Subsequent  WTO  proceedings \n\ninvolving \nRaw  Materials  and  a  similar  Chamber  of  Commerce \nconfirmed  that,  throughout  the  class  period,  price-\nfixing  of  these  materials,  as  well  as  Vitamin  C,  was \nrequired by China – a conclusion reached not only by \nChina, but by the WTO, the United States, the Euro-\npean Union, and Mexico as well. See JA676-77, 722.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f13 \n\nThe  upshot  is  that  every  independent  entity \nthat has analyzed the issues – other than the district \ncourt  below  –  has  concluded  that  China  continued  to \nmandate  price-fixing  for  commodities  subject  to  the \nPVC  procedure  throughout  the  class  period  in  this \ncase:    the  United States,  the  European  Union,  Mexi-\nco, the court of appeals below, and even another fed-\neral district judge in a different case.7   \n\nPlaintiffs  themselves  concede  the  continuation \nof  mandated  price-fixing  under  the  2002  regime.    In \nthe  court  below,  Plaintiffs  said  that  Chinese  law  “re-\nquired the Chamber and its Subcommittee to ‘actively \ncoordinate to set vitamin C export prices and quanti-\nties.’”    Brief  for  Plaintiffs-Appellees  at  25.8   And  in \nthis Court, Plaintiffs similarly acknowledge that: “On \npaper,  ‘verification  and  chop’  required  exporters  to \nsubmit  vitamin  C  export  contracts  to  the  Chamber, \nwhich  was  then  supposed  to  affix  a  seal  (or  ‘chop’)  if \nthe contract met or exceeded an industry-determined \nminimum export price.”  Pet. Br. 8.   \n\nAs  the  preceding  discussion  demonstrates  – \nwithout  even  citing  the  Ministry’s  submissions  –  the \nregulations  themselves  make  clear  that  Chinese  law \ncompelled  price-fixing  throughout  the  class  period.  \nThe  Ministry’s  submissions  confirming  that  fact  are \ndiscussed below. \n\n7 Animal Sci.

Petitioners’ class action complaint was filed \non  January  26,  2005,  in  the  Eastern  District  of  New \nYork, and subsequent cases were centralized there by \nthe  Judicial  Panel  on  Multidistrict  Litigation.   The \nprincipal allegations were that Respondents had fixed \nthe  price  of  Vitamin  C  exports  from  China  from  De-\ncember 2001 through June 30, 2006.  JA13, 52. \n\nRespondents  moved  to  dismiss  on  the  basis  of \nsovereign  compulsion,  act  of  state,  and  international \ncomity.   JA19-20.   The  motion  was  supported  by  an \namicus  brief  by  the  Ministry,  Pet.  App.  189a-\n223a, which, as the district court noted, was “unprec-\nedented.  [China]  has  never  before  come  before  the \nUnited  States  as  amicus  to  present  its  views.  This \nfact  alone  demonstrates  the  importance  the  Chinese \ngovernment places on this case.”  Id. 168a.  The ami-\ncus  brief  was  accompanied  by  a  sworn  declaration \nwith authenticated copies of the relevant legal mate-\nrials with certified translations that provided the evi-\ndentiary  basis  for  the  legal  statements  in  the  brief.  \nJA21.9   That  filing  was  followed  by  another  official \nstatement of the Ministry confirming the accuracy of \nthe positions taken in the amicus brief.  JA131-33. \n\nThe motion to dismiss was denied.  The district \ncourt  (Trager,  J.)  concluded  that  the  Ministry  was \n“entitled  to  substantial  deference,  but  [its  brief]  will \nnot  be  taken  as  conclusive  evidence  of  compulsion, \nparticularly where, as here, the plain language of the \ndocumentary evidence submitted by plaintiffs directly \n\n9 The  United  States  is  therefore  mistaken  to  claim  that  there \nhad been no “sworn evidentiary proffer” in support of the Minis-\ntry’s position. See U.S. Br. 24. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f15 \n\ncontradicts  the  Ministry’s  position.”   Pet.  App. \n181a.   The  Ministry  had  presented  logical  and  con-\nsistent  explanations  of  what  the  Chinese  regulatory \nregime  required  –  that  the  companies  enter  into  vol-\nuntary  agreements  on  price,  subject  to  the  coordina-\ntion  and  supervision  of  the  Chamber  and  its  Sub-\ncommittee.    See  JA248-50;  Pet.  App.  205a-06a,  208a-\n09a.  Nevertheless, the court concluded that the con-\ncepts of “self-regulation,” “self-restraint,” and “volun-\ntary” participation rendered it unclear “from the rec-\nord at this stage of the case whether defendants were \nperforming  a  government  function,  whether  they \nwere  acting  as  private  citizens  pursuant  to  govern-\nmental directives or whether they were acting as un-\nrestrained private citizens.”  Pet. App. 185a. \n\n2.  In  November  2009,  Defendants  moved  for \nsummary  judgment,  JA29,  supported  by  a  third  for-\nmal submission from the Ministry.  JA247-51.   \n\nThe district court (Cogan, J.) denied the motion \non  the  papers,  without  hearing  oral  argument  from \nthe parties or the Ministry. The court did not apply a \n“substantial  deference”  standard  to  China’s  submis-\nsions.    Cf.  Pet.  Br.  3.    Instead,  the  court  simply  “de-\ncline[d]  to  defer  to  the  Chinese  government’s  state-\nments to the court regarding Chinese law.”  Pet. App. \n56a,  118a-19a.10   The  court  asserted  that,  “when  the \nalleged  compulsion  is  in  the  defendants’  own  self-\ninterest,  a  more  careful  scrutiny  of  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s  statement  is  warranted.”    Id.  121a.    It  said \nthat  the  2009  statement  was  “particularly  undeserv-\ning  of  deference,”  id. 119a,  and  “suggest[ed]  that  the \n\n10 The  court  made  one  exception,  deferring  to  “the  Ministry’s \nexplanation  of  the  relationship  between  the  Ministry  and  the \nChamber.”  Pet. App. 118a. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f16 \n\nMinistry’s  assertion  of  compulsion  is  a  post  hoc  at-\ntempt  to  shield  defendants’  conduct  from  antitrust \nscrutiny.”  Id. 121a. \n\nThe  court  asserted  that  the  positions  taken  by \nRespondents and the Ministry were inconsistent with \nChina’s representations to the WTO that it had given \nup  “export  administration”  of  Vitamin  C.    Id.  74a, \n120a-21a, 123a, 136a.  The court, however, never ex-\namined  what  “export  administration”  meant  –  ignor-\ning  that  it  meant  only  non-automatic  licensing  and \nexport quotas, as the United States and the WTO had \nconfirmed.  See p. 12 above. \n\nBypassing  the  Ministry,  the  district  court  of-\nfered  its  own  construction  grounded  in  its  own  in-\nstincts rather than any identifiable principles of Chi-\nnese law.  For example: \n\n•  Despite  the  explicit  written  requirement  that \nexporters could not export unless they reported \nthe  “industry-wide  negotiated  prices”  to  the \nChamber, the court concluded that “defendants \nhad  the  power  to  effectively  suspend  verifica-\ntion  and  chop  simply  by  not  reaching  any \nagreements in the first instance.”  Id. 125a. \n•  As to the provision in the 2002 Notice allowing \nCustoms  and  the  Chambers  to  suspend  price \nreview  with  the  approval  of  the  members,  the \ncourt  elected  to  “interpret  [it]  as  granting  de-\nfendants  the  unilateral  authority  to  suspend \nverification and chop.”  Id. 123a-24a (emphasis \nadded). \n\n•  “Although  the  2003  Announcement  does  not \ncontain a similar explicit suspension provision, \nI construe the 2003 Announcement as granting \ndefendants  the  same  power”  to  suspend  PVC.  \nId. 124a-25a. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f17 \n\n•  The  court  concluded  that  the  2002  regime  did \nnot  cover  output  restrictions  even  though  “the \nterm  ‘industry  agreements’  in  the  2003  Proce-\ndures  is  broad  enough  to  also  include  agree-\nments on output restrictions.”  Id. 126a-27a. \n•  “[I]f all the members simply resigned from the \nSubcommittee  .  .  .  there  would  be  no  price  or \noutput  restrictions  that  [non-members]  would \nbe required to follow.”  Id. 135a. \n\nNotwithstanding its acknowledgement that, “to \nreceive  a  chop  under  the  2002  PVC  Notice  and  2003 \nAnnouncement,  an  export  contract  was  .  .  .  required \nto  comply  with  the  industry-agreed  minimum  price,” \nid. 126a, the district court concluded that compulsion \nwas  not  proven  because  China  did  not  dictate  the \nspecific  prices  to  be  set,  and  defendants’  agreements \non  prices  above  a  specified  minimum  went  “beyond \nthe  scope  of  any  potential  compulsion.”    Id.  106a, \n139a-42a. The court understood that Chinese law and \ncustom  are  “something  of  a  departure”  from  the  con-\nstructs of Western society, id. 116a-17a, but proceed-\ned  to  evaluate  China’s  regulatory  system  by  treating \ntranslated  Chinese  terms  of  art  without  regard  to \ntheir meaning and usage in Chinese law.  In particu-\nlar, the court construed “industrial self-discipline” as \nimplicating purely private, unilateral conduct, direct-\nly  contrary  to  the  term’s  actual  meaning  under  Chi-\nnese law, custom, and practice.  Id. 152a; see also id. \n83a n.17, 120a n.39; JA138-39. \n\nThe  court  recognized  that  its  rulings  were  in-\nconsistent with the WTO proceedings in the Raw Ma-\nterials matter, id. 136a-39a, and with the New Jersey \ndistrict  court  decision  in  Animal  Science,  id.  105a-\n106a, but was undeterred. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f18 \n\n3.  Following  class  certification,  trial  was  held \nfrom February 25, 2013 to March 14, 2013.  Respond-\nents’  ability  to  defend  themselves  at  trial  was  con-\nstrained.  The  Ministry’s  submissions  and  applicable \nChinese  regulations  were  excluded  from  evidence. \nRespondents proposed to have a former Ministry offi-\ncial,  Qiao  Haili,  offer  a  detailed  description  of  the \nChinese  regulatory  regime  in  which  the  businesses \noperated (supported by copies of the regulations) and \nexplain  how  the  Ministry  compelled  the  conduct  at \nissue.  JA411-39.    Mr.  Qiao  proposed  to  testify  to  the \ncreation of the Chamber and Sub-Committee, the his-\ntory  of  Chinese  Vitamin  C  regulation,  how  the  Sub-\nCommittee  and  Chamber  operated  under  the  guid-\nance  of  the  Ministry  to  effect  Chinese  policy  goals, \nand how the system of “self-discipline” was a manda-\ntory aspect of the Chinese regulatory regime. JA413-\n38. The district court, however, excluded much of this \nevidence,  leaving  only  a  shell  of  Mr.  Qiao’s  proposed \ntestimony. CAJA, at SPA178-88, 216-40. \n\nFollowing  settlements  with  the  other  defend-\nants,  the  jury  found  Respondents  liable  for  violating \nthe  Sherman  Act.    After  post-trial  motion  practice, \nincluding  an  award  of  attorneys’  fees  and  costs  and \noffsets  for  settlement  monies  received,  the  judgment \nawarded  the  Damages  Class  monetary  relief  (includ-\ning attorneys’ fees and costs) of $147,831,471.03 plus \npost-judgment  interest,  and  an  injunction  barring \nRespondents  from  coordinating  prices  for  Vitamin  C \nwithout  regard  for  any  potential  contrary  commands \nof the Chinese government.  JA50-51. \n\n4.  Explaining  that  “China  has  attached  great \nimportance  to  this  case,”  China  submitted  a  formal \nprotest  of  the  district  court’s  rulings in  the  form  of  a \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f19 \n\ndiplomatic  note  to  the  U.S.  Department  of  State.  \nJA782-84. \n\njurisdiction  on \n\n5.  The Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit \nvacated the judgment with instructions to dismiss the \ncomplaint.  Pet. App. 1a-38a.  In a unanimous opinion \nby  Judge  Hall  (joined  by  Judges  Cabranes  and  Wes-\nley),  the  court  held  that  the  district  court  abused  its \ndiscretion by denying deference to the Ministry’s for-\nmal  submissions,  and  by  declining  to  abstain  from \nexercising \ncomity \ngrounds.  Citing United States v. Pink,  315  U.S.  203 \n(1942),  the  court  ruled  that  “when  a  foreign  govern-\nment,  acting  through  counsel  or  otherwise,  directly \nparticipates  in  U.S.  court  proceedings  by  providing  a \nsworn  evidentiary  proffer  regarding  the  construction \nand  effect  of  its  laws  and  regulations,  which  is  rea-\nsonable  under  the  circumstances  presented,  a  U.S. \ncourt  is  bound  to  defer  to  those  statements.”    Pet. \nApp. 11a, 25a.  \n\ninternational \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  applied  the  international \ncomity  balancing  test  developed  by  the  circuit  courts \nin  Timberlane  Lumber  Co.  v.  Bank  of  Am.,  549  F.2d \n597,  614-15  (9th  Cir.  1976),  and  Mannington  Mills, \nInc.  v.  Congoleum  Corp.,  595  F.2d  1287,  1297-98  (3d \nCir. 1979); see also RESTATEMENT (THIRD) OF FOREIGN \nRELATIONS LAW OF THE UNITED STATES  §  403  (1987). \nThe  court  analyzed  the  Ministry’s  submissions  and \nconcluded that its reasonable explanation of the regu-\nlatory  system,  together  with  the  record  available  at \nthe  motion  to  dismiss  stage,  established  conclusively \nthat  it  was  impossible  for  Respondents  to  comply \nwith  both  Chinese  law  and  the  Sherman  Act.  Pet. \nApp.  27a-33a.    The  court  also  determined  that  the \ndistrict  court’s  construction  of  the  system  was  “non-\nsensical”  and  erroneous  in  several  respects  apart \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 \n\nfrom  the  refusal  to  give  any  deference  to  the  Minis-\ntry’s  submissions.  Id.;  see  pp.  45-46  below.    Having \nfound  a  conflict  between  U.S.  and  Chinese  law,  the \ncourt concluded that the remaining comity abstention \nfactors “decidedly weigh[ed] in favor of dismissal and \ncounsel[ed]  against  exercising  jurisdiction  in  this \ncase,” Pet. App. 34a, a point which Petitioners did not \ncontest.11  It thus vacated the judgment with instruc-\ntions  to  dismiss.    Rehearing  was  denied  without  rec-\norded dissent. \n\n6.  Petitioners sought certiorari, and their peti-\ntion was granted on January 12, 2018, limited to the \nquestion  (no.  2)  of  the  appropriate  level  of  deference \nto be given to the Ministry’s submissions. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\n1.    The  standard  for  deference  unanimously \nadopted by the court of appeals is correct.  The court \nanalyzed  the  applicable  Chinese  regulatory  provi-\nsions  and  concluded  that  China’s  formal  interpreta-\ntion  was  reasonable  and  worthy  of  deference.    Its \nstandard,  which  could  be  summarized  as  “defer  if \nreasonable,”  is  consistent  with  FED.  R.  CIV.  P.  44.1, \nand  with  this  Court’s  decision  in  Pink.    This  Court \nhas  invariably  deferred  to  the  formal  statements  of \nforeign governments about their own laws, and there \nis no reason to depart from that course here. \n\n11 Petitioners  argued  only  one  aspect  of  the  comity  analysis  be-\nfore  the  court  of  appeals, viz., whether  there  was  a  conflict  be-\ntween  the  Sherman  Act  and  Chinese  law.    Petitioners  did  not \nargue that any of the other recognized comity factors weighed in \ntheir  favor.    Brief  for  Plaintiffs-Appellees  at  45-46  (attached  as \nAnnex B). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f21 \n\nThe no deference (or effectively negative defer-\nence) approach deployed by the district court and ad-\nvocated  by  Petitioners  violates  important  interna-\ntional  comity  principles  and  risks  excessively  entan-\ngling  the  federal  courts  in  matters  of  foreign  affairs.  \nThe  amorphous  and  ill-defined  proposals  by  various \namici  supporting  Petitioners  do  no  better,  for  they \nwould  inject  tremendous  uncertainty  into  litigation \nover  the  meaning  of  foreign  law  and  invite  district \ncourts to impose American-style legal analysis on for-\neign regimes whose cultural contexts and legal norms \nmay differ radically from our own. \n\n2.  The Ministry’s construction of its own regu-\nlatory  system  was  accurate,  and  indeed  is  the  only \ncoherent  interpretation  of  that  regime.    As  the  regu-\nlations  specified,  and  as  the  Ministry  explained,  Vit-\namin C exporters were required by China to fix prices \n– to “coordinate” prices as a matter of “industry self-\ndiscipline”  under  the  supervision  of  the  Chamber.  \nThat  view  of  China’s  regulatory  regime  was  con-\nfirmed  in  related  WTO  proceedings  involving  Raw \nMaterials.    There,  the  United  States,  Europe,  and \nMexico, all agreed – relying on the Ministry’s submis-\nsions in this case – that China required exporters “to \nexport at set or coordinated export prices or otherwise \nface penalties.”  The WTO, also relying on the Minis-\ntry’s submissions, concurred. \n\n3.  Petitioners’ request to reinstate the district \ncourt’s  comity  ruling  has  no  merit.    Wholly  apart \nfrom  the  district  court’s  erroneous  and  disrespectful \ndeference standard, the court of appeals correctly re-\njected the district court’s key rulings, concluding that \nthe  court’s  construction  of  China’s  regulatory  system \nwas “nonsensical.” \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f22 \n\n4.    Irrespective  of  the  level  of  deference  to  the \nMinistry, the judgment should be affirmed.  The only \nissue  on  comity  abstention  below  was  whether  there \nwas a true conflict between the requirements of Chi-\nnese law and the Sherman Act.  The existence of con-\nflict  was  established  not just  by  the  Ministry,  but by \nthe  regulations  themselves  and  their  requirement \nthat  Vitamin  C  exporters  coordinate  their  prices \nthrough industrial self-discipline. \n\nChina’s  requirement  that  competitors  coordi-\nnate  their  prices  compelled  a  per  se  violation  of  the \nSherman Act in direct conflict with U.S. law.  As con-\nflict  was  the  only  comity  issue  contested  below,  this \nCourt  should  affirm  the  judgment  of  the  court  of  ap-\npeals. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI. \n\nTHE  SECOND  CIRCUIT’S  DEFERENCE  STAND-\nARD IS CORRECT AND CONSISTENT WITH RULE \n44.1 \n\nA.  The  Second  Circuit’s  limited  holding  is \nconsistent  with  this  Court’s  controlling \nprecedent and Rule 44.1 \n\n1.   The  Second  Circuit  held  that,  when  pre-\nsented  with  the  official  statement  of  a  foreign  sover-\neign “regarding the construction and effect of its laws \nand  regulations,  which  is  reasonable  under  the  cir-\ncumstances presented, a U.S. court is bound to defer \nto  those  statements.”    Pet.  App.  25a.    This  modest \nholding appropriately  balances  judicial  independence \nagainst the principles of international comity, reflect-\ning  the  respect  owed  to  exercises  of  sovereignty  by \nother nations.  See JOSEPH STORY, COMMENTARIES ON \nTHE CONFLICT OF LAWS §§ 33, 37-38 (8th ed. 1883). \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f23 \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  found  that  the  Ministry \nwas  the  “highest  authority  within  the  Chinese  Gov-\nernment  authorized  to  regulate  foreign  trade,”  Pet. \nApp.  6a;  that  the  Ministry  provided  authenticated \ncopies  of  its  regulations,  id.  8a  &  n.6;  and  that  the \nMinistry’s interpretation was reasonable, id. 27a-28a. \nAs  the  court  explained,  the  regulations  themselves \n“demonstrate[d]  that  .  .  .  Chinese  law  required  De-\nfendants to participate in the PVC regime in order to \nexport  vitamin  C.”  Id.  27a.  Petitioners’  characteriza-\ntion  of  the  decision  below  as  applying  “blind  defer-\nence,”  turning  on  the  “bare  fact  of  the  [foreign  gov-\nernment’s] appearance,” e.g., Pet. Br. 22-23, 26, 34, is \nuntenable.    The  court  analyzed  and  specifically  en-\ndorsed the Ministry’s key conclusions. \n\nPetitioners  never  say  precisely  what  standard \nof deference should be applied in this case.  They do, \nhowever,  rely  on  the  district  court’s  assertions  that \nthe Ministry’s statements were a “post-hoc attempt to \nshield  defendants’  conduct,”  Pet.  App.  121a,  and  a \n“carefully crafted and phrased litigation position,” id. \n120a.  See Pet. Br. 18-19, 34-35, 54.  Petitioners thus \nendorse  a  rule  of  negative  deference,  treating  a  for-\neign  sovereign  appearing  before  a  U.S.  court  with \nsuspicion  rather  than  respect.    Such  a  rule  is  anti-\nthetical  to  the  respect  that  the  courts  of  this  nation \nowe  to  “the  independence  of  every  other  sovereign \nstate.”    Underhill  v.  Hernandez,  168  U.S.  250,  252 \n(1897).  \n\n2.  The court of appeals relied appropriately on \nUnited  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S.  203  (1942),  in  adopt-\ning  its  deference  standard.    Pink  held  that  the  “offi-\ncial  declaration”  of  the  Soviet  Commissariat,  which \nhad  the  “power  to  interpret  existing  Russian  law,” \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f24 \n\nwas  “conclusive”  as  to  the  meaning  of  a  Russian  ex-\npropriation decree.  Id. at 220. \n\nPink  cannot  be  distinguished  from  this  case.  \nFirst,  the  fact  that  the  Commissariat’s  declaration \nwas  received  through  “diplomatic  channels”  was  not \nsignificant  in  itself  but  rather  because  it  proved  the \ndeclaration’s “authenticity and authority.”  Id. at 218, \n221.    The  “authenticity  and  authority”  of  the  Minis-\ntry’s statements in this case has also been established, \nincluding through “diplomatic channels.”  The Minis-\ntry  stated  clearly  that  it  was  authorized  to  present \nthe  “official  views  of  the  People’s  Republic of  China,” \nJA131,  and  that  authority  was  confirmed  in  China’s \ndiplomatic note to the State Department, JA782-84.  \n\nSecond,  the  “conclusive”  effect  given  to  the \nCommissariat’s  declaration  based  solely  on  the  Com-\nmissariat’s “power to interpret existing Russian law,” \nPink, 315 U.S. at 220, cannot be squared with the Pe-\ntitioners’  claim,  Pet.  Br.  40,  that  other  record  evi-\ndence  was  somehow  crucial  to  the  decision.    The \nCourt  did  not  cite  any  other  evidence  except  for  a \npassing  observation  that  the  “expert  testimony  ten-\ndered by the United States gave great credence” to its \nposition on the Russian decree in a prior case.  Pink, \n315 U.S. at 218.  Before the case reached this Court, \nhowever, the New York courts had found that the ev-\nidence  established  that  the  Russian  decrees  did  not \napply  extraterritorially.    See  Moscow  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v. \nBank  of  N.Y.  &  Trust  Co.,  280  N.Y.  286,  309-11 \n(1939),  aff’d  by  an  equally  divided  Court,  309  U.S. \n624 (1940).  This Court declined to parse the evidence \nbecause Russia’s contrary statement was “conclusive.” \n(In  this  case,  in  any  event,  the  record  outside  the \nMinistry’s proffer confirms that  the Ministry’s expla-\nnation was correct.  See pp. 4-11 above.) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f25 \n\n3.   This  Court  has  never  deviated  from  the \nclear rule of deference established in Pink more than \n75 years ago.  Petitioners identify no case where this \nCourt has rejected (or even questioned) a foreign gov-\nernment’s  explanation  of  its  own  law,  and  research \nhas  identified  none.    This  Court  has  consistently \nframed its holdings to accord with the explanations of \nforeign  sovereigns,  implicitly  treating  them  as  cor-\nrect.    See  Abbott  v.  Abbott,  560  U.S.  1,  10-12,  14-15 \n(2010);  JPMorgan  Chase  Bank  v.  Traffic  Stream \n(BVI)  Infrastructure  Ltd.,  536  U.S.  88,  98-99  (2002); \nDoe  v.  United  States,  487  U.S.  201,  218  n.16  (1988); \ncf.  Republic  of  Philippines  v.  Pimentel,  553  U.S.  851, \n866-67  (2008)  (“[W]here  sovereign  immunity  is  as-\nserted,  and  the  claims  of  the  sovereign  are  not  frivo-\nlous,  dismissal  of  the  action  must  be  ordered  where \nthere  is  a  potential  for  injury  to  the  interests  of  the \nabsent sovereign.”).   \n\nThe  cases  cited  by  Petitioners  and  their  amici \nare  not  to  the  contrary.    First  National  City  Bank  v. \nBanco  Para  El  Comercio  Exterior  de  Cuba  (Bancec) \ninvolved  the  trial  testimony  of  an  attorney  in  Cuba’s \nForeign  Trade  Ministry,  not  an  official  statement  by \nthe Cuban government. 462 U.S. 611, 616 n.3 (1983).  \nRegardless,  the  Court  did  not  dispute  the  witness’s \ntestimony that Bancec had “independent legal status” \nunder  Cuban  law,  id.,  but  found  that  choice  of  law \nprinciples  dictated  that  Cuban  law  should  not  apply \nto  an  expropriation  claim  not  arising  under  Cuban \nlaw.  Id. at 621-23.  Similarly, in Intel Corporation v. \nAdvanced  Micro  Devices,  Inc.,  the  Court  did  not  dis-\npute  the  European  Commission’s  description  of  its \npowers and role within the EU legal system.  542 U.S. \n241,  254-55  (2004).    The  Court  rejected  only  the \nCommission’s  view  of  the  significance  of  those  facts \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f26 \n\nunder U.S. law, finding that based on its own descrip-\ntion  the  Commission  was  a  “tribunal”  as  the  term  is \nused in 28 U.S.C. § 1782.  542 U.S. at 258.   \n\n4.  Both  Pink  and  the  decision  below  are  con-\n\nsistent with FED. R. CIV. P. 44.1.   \n\nThere  is  nothing  in  the  text  or  history  of  Rule \n44.1 that suggests it was intended to alter or overrule \nPink.  Nor is there any conceptual incompatibility be-\ntween  the  general  obligation  of  courts  to  determine \nforeign  law  under  Rule  44.1  and  rules  that  focus \ncourts’ discretion in doing so.   \n\nRule  44.1  was  designed  to  end  unpredictable \nfactual  inquiries  in  favor  of  more  orderly  resolutions \nmade as a matter of law.  See FED. R. CIV. P. 44.1 ad-\nvisory committee note.  There is no incompatibility in \nsaying that, within the determination of this question \nof  law,  all  sources  should  be  considered  but  the  offi-\ncial submission of a foreign government should be fol-\nlowed  if  not  unreasonable.    In  fact,  fashioning  clear \nrules  for  the  weight  afforded  to  specific  types  of \nsources is fully consistent with the fact that the Rule \n44.1  inquiry  is  a  determination  of  law  reviewed  de \nnovo on appeal, not a factual determination involving \nweighing evidence and assessing credibility.  \n\n5.   Each  of  the  appellate  cases  cited  by  Peti-\ntioners is consistent with the Second Circuit’s holding \nthat  conclusive  deference  is  due  only  when  a  foreign \ngovernment appears before a U.S. court and presents \nan  official  governmental  explanation  of  its  domestic \nlaw  that  is  reasonable.    See  United  States v.  McNab, \n331 F.3d 1228, 1233-35, 1240-42 (11th Cir. 2003) (dis-\ntrict court properly deferred to initial Honduran gov-\nernment  interpretation;  court  of  appeals  declined  to \noverturn  judgment  based  on  new  and  inconsistent \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f27 \n\nHonduran  interpretation  received  post-judgment); \nMcKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 \nF.3d  1101,  1108-09  (D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (crediting  Iran’s \naffidavits  but  observing  that  they  described  no  bind-\ning  requirement  under  Iranian  law),  vacated,  320 \nF.3d 280 (D.C. Cir. 2003); Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI \nTelecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d  694,  714  (5th  Cir.  1999) \n(declining  to  defer  to  a  Mexican  agency  circular \nwhere the Mexican government did not appear, and it \nwas  unclear  whether  circular  applied  given  legal \nchanges post-dating the circular). \n\n6.  The  approach  adopted  by  the  Second  Cir-\ncuit  is  also  eminently  practical.  As  one  commentator \nhas observed:  \n\nHolding  that  U.S.  courts  can  second  guess \nthe  highest  administrative  authority  of  a \nforeign  state  on  interpretations  of  that \nstate’s  law  would  raise  serious  practical \nproblems.  Most  obviously,  it  would  create \ndifficulties  for  the  regulated  entities,  who \nface  the  possibility  of  being  told  by  a  for-\neign  regulator  that  they  must  do  x  and \nthen being told by a U.S. court that the for-\neign  regulator  misunderstood  its  own  do-\nmestic  law  and  that  they  should  not  have \ndone x. \n\nDaniel  A.  Crane,  The  Chinese  Vitamins  Case:  Who \nDecides  Chinese  Law?,  COMPETITION POLICY INT’L,  at \n4  (March  2018),  available  at  goo.gl/J9wKp8.    The \nSecond  Circuit’s  rule  thus  helps  avoid  the  incon-\nsistent  obligations  that  would  likely  arise  if  the  fed-\neral  courts  routinely  second-guessed  foreign  regula-\ntors’ interpretations of their own laws. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f28 \n\nB.  International comity principles counsel a \nstrong standard of deference for foreign \nsovereigns \n\n1.  International  comity  is  the  “recognition \nwhich  one  nation  allows  within  its  territory  to  the \nlegislative,  executive  or  judicial  acts  of  another  na-\ntion,  having  due  regard  both  to  international  duty \nand convenience, and to the rights of its own citizens, \nor of other persons who are under the protection of its \nlaws.”  Hilton  v.  Guyot,  159  U.S.  113,  163-64  (1895).  \nThis  recognition  is  not  an  “absolute  obligation,”  but \nneither  is  it,  as  Petitioners  suggest,  a  voluntary  ex-\ntension  based  on  “mere  courtesy  and good will.”    Id.; \nsee  also  Mitsubishi  Motors  Corp.  v.  Soler  Chrysler-\nPlymouth,  Inc.,  473  U.S.  614,  629  (1985)  (arbitration \nclause  in international  agreement  enforceable  due  to \n“concerns  of  international  comity  .  .  .  even  assuming \nthat  a  contrary  result  would  be  forthcoming  in  a  do-\nmestic context”).     \n\nInternational  comity  is  not  a  “vague  political \nconcern favoring international cooperation when it is \nin  our  interest  to  do  so”;  it  is  also  motivated  by  pro-\nmoting  “reciprocal  tolerance  and  goodwill.”    Societe \nNationale Industrielle Aerospatiale v. U.S. Dist. Court, \n482 U.S. 522, 555 (1987) (Blackmun, J., concurring in \npart  and  dissenting  in  part).    Comity  requires  more \nthan  merely  “prioritiz[ing]  accuracy,  reliability,  and \njudicial  independence.”    Pet.  Br.  44.    It  requires  also \nrespect  for  the  knowledge  that  foreign  sovereigns \nhave about their own laws. See In re Oil Spill by the \nAmoco Cadiz Off the Coast of France, 954 F.2d 1279, \n1312  (7th  Cir.  1992).    It  would  be  anomalous  to  re-\nspect  a  foreign  government  while  disrespecting  the \nformal  representations  it  makes  before  U.S.  courts.  \nAccordingly, this Court has in other contexts granted \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f29 \n\nvery substantial deference to the reasonable explana-\ntions of foreign sovereigns.  See Pimentel, 553 U.S. at \n866-67  (comity  requires  that  U.S.  defer  to  a  nation’s \nnon-frivolous assertions of sovereign immunity); p. 25 \nabove.  There  is  no  justification  for  withholding  simi-\nlar  treatment  for  foreign  sovereigns’  explanations  of \nthe meaning of their own laws. \n\nA  strong  deference  rule  in  cases  like  this  one \nthus  “helps  the  potentially  conflicting  laws  of  differ-\nent  nations  work  together  in  harmony—a  harmony \nparticularly  needed  in  today’s  highly  interdependent \ncommercial  world.”    F.  Hoffmann-La  Roche  Ltd.  v. \nEmpagran S.A., 542 U.S. 155, 164-65 (2004); see also \nSosa  v.  Alvarez-Machain,  542  U.S.  692,  761  (2004) \n(Breyer,  J.,  concurring  in  relevant  part).    Failing  to \ncredit a foreign sovereign’s reasonable explanation of \nits own laws, particularly where that explanation re-\nveals a true conflict of law, can be an “act of legal im-\nperialism”  that  increases  friction  between  nations, \nimpairing the application of U.S. law and the promo-\ntion of U.S. interests.  Empagran, 542 U.S. at 169; see \nalso  Microsoft  Corp.  v.  AT&T  Corp.,  550  U.S.  437, \n454  (2007)  (noting  “presumption  that  United  States \nlaw  governs  domestically  but  does  not  rule  the \nworld”). \n\n2.  Petitioners  misplace  reliance  on  two  re-\ngional  treaties  –  to  which  the  United  States  is  not  a \nsignatory  –  that  simply  create  a  common,  non-\nexclusive  mechanism  for  sharing  information.    The \ntreaties do not address the official statement of a for-\neign sovereign as to the meaning of its own laws; they \ninstead focus on the treatment of information shared \nthrough treaty channels – information that may come \nfrom  any  number  of  sources,  including  private  law-\nyers,  experts,  academics,  judges,  and  other  unspeci-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f30 \n\nfied but non-binding avenues of finding foreign law.12  \nAnd both treaties make clear that they merely estab-\nlish a baseline that does not displace any other rules \nor standards that signatories may have implemented \nfor considering questions of foreign law.13   \n\nThere  is  no  inconsistency  in  affording  greater \ndeference when a government asserts its sovereignty \nby making the affirmative decision to appear in a liti-\ngation  to  correct  or  forestall  a  misunderstanding  of \nits  laws  than  when  responding  less  formally  under \ntreaties  such  as  these.    If  the  call  of  international \ncomity on “each nation state . . . to ‘respect the inde-\npendence  and  dignity  of  every  other’”  is  to  have \nmeaning, it  must  matter  greatly  when  one  sovereign \nappears in the courts of another to explain in official \nterms what its own laws require of its own subjects in \nits  own  territory.    Bolivarian  Republic  of  Venez.  v. \n\n12 See, e.g., The European Convention on Information on Foreign \nLaw,  art.  8,  June  7,  1968,  720  U.N.T.S.  154  (allowing  states  to \ndelegate  responsibility  for  replies  to  private  bodies);  Inter-\nAmerican  Convention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on  Foreign \nLaw,  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  1439  U.N.T.S.  111  (“Inter-American \nConvention”)  (the  nation  providing  information  “shall  not  be \nheld  responsible  for  the  opinion  expressed  nor  shall  it  be  re-\nquired to apply the law, or cause it to be applied, in accordance \nwith the content of the reply provided”).  The same is true of the \nHague  Conference  proposal  cited  by  Petitioners.   See Response \nof the United States of America to Feasibility Study on the \nTreatment of Foreign Law Questionnaire,  Preliminary  Doc.  No. \n25  (Oct.  2007)  at  14-15,  available at goo.gl/SjC31Z  (suggesting \nmechanisms  such  as  a  “panel  of  experts”  and  the  use  of  “infor-\nmal  channels”  for communications  between  the  judiciary of  dif-\nferent countries). \n\n13  Explanatory  Report  to  the  European  Convention  on  Infor-\nmation  on  Foreign  Law  ¶  4,  E.T.S.

Ct. 1312, \n1319-20  (2017)  (quoting  Berizzi Bros. Co. v. S. S.  Pe-\nsaro, 271 U.S. 562, 575 (1926)). \n\n3.   Petitioners’  comparison  to  treaty  interpre-\ntation generally also fails.  There are good reasons to \ngrant  a  higher  degree  of  deference  in  this  case  than \nthe “great weight” that this Court has given to Execu-\ntive  Branch  interpretations  of  treaties.    Sumitomo \nShoji  Am.,  Inc.  v.  Avagliano,  457  U.S.  176,  184-85 \n(1982).    First,  treaties  are  bilateral  agreements  be-\ntween  sovereigns,  and  the  parties  to  a  treaty  may \ndisagree  as  to  the  interpretation  of  its  provisions.  \nThis  case  concerns  a  sovereign’s  explanation  of  its \nunilaterally  enacted  legislation.   Second,  treaties  are \nagreements  to  cede  a  degree  of  sovereignty  in  ex-\nchange for some benefit.  Lawmaking is an exercise of \nsovereignty,  and  thus  a  foreign  government  may \nrightly  expect  a  higher  degree  of  deference  when  ex-\nplaining the meaning of its laws.14   \n\n4.   Petitioners’  analogies  to  domestic  contexts \n\nfail to capture the relevant international concerns. \n\nAs  the  United  States  points  out,  deference \nrules for U.S. administrative agencies do “not readily \ntranslate”  to  the  present  context.    U.S.  Br.  20.  Peti-\ntioners  nevertheless  attempt  to  impose  the  frame-\nwork  of  Chevron,  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v.  Natural  Resources \nDefense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984), as the ceil-\ning for  deference  to  a  foreign  sovereign.   Pet.  Br.  48-\n\n14 Petitioners wrongly  suggest  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  holding \nrequires  courts  to  give  greater  deference  to  foreign  agencies \nthan to the U.S. Department of State as to the meaning of trea-\nties.  Pet. Br. 51 n.16.  The decision below is limited to a foreign \nsovereign’s explanations of its domestic law.  Pet. App. 11a-12a, \n34a.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f32 \n\n55.    Chevron  deference,  however,  is  based on  respect \nfor the division of powers among coordinate branches \nof  the  same  government.    By  contrast,  the  deference \nafforded  to  a  foreign  government  as  a  matter  of  in-\nternational  comity  derives  from  respect  for  its  inde-\npendent sovereign authority.  Hilton, 159 U.S. at 163-\n64; see Access Telecom, 197 F.3d at 714 (rejecting ar-\ngument that Chevron directly bore on the question of \ndeference  to  a  foreign  agency).    If  Chevron  has  any \nrelevance here, it is because it would be anomalous to \ngive  less  respect  to  a  foreign  sovereign’s  direct  exer-\ncise  of  independent  sovereignty  than  to  an  adminis-\ntrative  agency’s  domestic  exercise  of  delegated  rule-\nmaking  authority.  Amoco  Cadiz,  954  F.2d  at  1312 \n(“Giving the conclusions of a sovereign nation less re-\nspect  than  those  of  [a  U.S.]  administrative  agency  is \nunacceptable.”). \n\nPetitioners’  comparison  to  deference  rules  for \nstate  governments  fares  no  better.    Petitioners  are \nincorrect  that  this  Court  has  held  that  the  Constitu-\ntion requires federal courts to give greater  respect to \nstate  governments  than  to  foreign  sovereigns.    The \nauthority they cite, Bond v. Hume, concerns only “the \nrelation of the several states to each other.”  243 U.S. \n15,  22  (1917)  (emphasis  added).    In  any  case,  Peti-\ntioners  concede  that  constructions  of  state  law  made \nby the highest court of a state receive conclusive def-\nerence in U.S. federal courts.  Pet. Br. 56; accord U.S. \nBr. 27 (“binding”).   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f33 \n\nDeference  rules  for  state  governments  provide \nno  support  for  the no deference  rule  Petitioners  urge \nhere.15 \n\nC.  Deference  is  particularly  appropriate  in \nthis  case  because  it  implicates  a  conflict \nbetween  sharply  divergent  economic  and \ntrade regimes properly reserved for reso-\nlution by the political branches \n\n1.  A high degree of deference to foreign sover-\neigns’  reasonable  explanations  of  their  own  laws  is \nnecessary to avoid interference with the international \nrelations prerogatives of the political branches.  This \nCourt  has  held  in  many  contexts  that  separation-of-\npowers  concerns  and  recognition  of  the  limits  of  the \njudiciary’s  institutional  competence  warrant  great \ncare  to  avoid  negative  foreign  policy  consequences.   \nKiobel  v.  Royal  Dutch  Petroleum  Co.,  569  U.S.  108, \n116 (2013); see also Sosa, 542 U.S. at 727 (recognition \nof  new  claims  under  the  Alien  Tort  Statute);  Banco \nNacional  de  Cuba  v.  Sabbatino,  376  U.S.  398,  423 \n(1964)  (act  of  state  doctrine);  McCulloch  v.  Sociedad \n\n15 The standard of deference advocated by the United States ap-\npears  to  be  one  of  substantial  deference,  but  the  government \nadds a long list of factors that render its ultimate standard un-\nclear.  U.S. Br. 16-21.  Such a vague standard would give district \ncourts no guidance and would undermine Rule 44.1’s objective of \nclarity and consistency. Cf. Benjamin G. Bradshaw, et al., Inter-\nnational Comity in the Enforcement of U.S. Antitrust Law in the \nWake of In re Vitamin C,  31  ANTITRUST  87,  90  (Spring  2017) \n(praising  “clarity”  of  Second  Circuit’s  approach).    The  U.S. \nChamber articulates a standard of “substantial deference.”  Pro-\nvided that the foreign sovereign’s construction of its own laws is \n“reasonable,” Pet. App. 25a, or “not frivolous,” Pimentel, 553 U.S. \nat 866-67, a substantial deference standard should require that \nconstruction to be followed – just as the court of appeals did here.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f34 \n\nNacional  de  Marineros  de  Honduras,  372  U.S.  10 \n(1963)  (application  of  the  National  Labor  Relations \nAct).  The case for deference to the political branches \nconcerning  “delicate  field[s]  of  international  rela-\ntions” is at its strongest where “the possibilities of in-\nternational discord are . . . evident and retaliative ac-\ntion . . . certain.”  Benz v. Compania Naviera Hidalgo, \nS.A., 353 U.S. 138, 147 (1957).   \n\nThe  extraterritorial  application  of  U.S.  anti-\ntrust  laws  implicates  “a  foreign nation’s  ability  inde-\npendently  to  regulate  its  own  commercial  affairs,”  a \nsensitive aspect of international relations. Empagran, \n542 U.S. at 165; see also Timberlane, 549 F.2d at 612.  \nAnd,  as  this  case  demonstrates,  the  risk  of  interna-\ntional  discord  is  particularly  acute  when  U.S.  anti-\ntrust law is applied to conduct required under foreign \nlaw.    The  district  court’s  disrespectful  treatment  of \nand  refusal  to  grant  any  deference  to  the  Ministry \ntriggered  an  immediate  diplomatic  response:  the \nChinese government formally protested its treatment \nin a diplomatic note to the U.S. Department of State \nthat  emphasized  the  “great  importance”  that  China \nattaches to this case and to the degree of respect that \nits  official  statements  receive  in  foreign  courts.  \nJA782-84.  A Ministry spokesperson hinted at broad-\ner  economic  consequences  as  well,  stating  that  the \ndistrict  court  ruling  would  “cause  problems  for  the \ninternational  community  and  international  enter-\nprises”  and  predicting  an  “increase  of  international \ndisputes”  that  “will  eventually  harm  the  interests  of \nthe  United  States.”    CAJA1666;  see  also  CAJA1667-\n72,  1678-79.    If  the  United  States  wants  China  to \nchange  its  regulatory  system  for  exports,  that  is  a \nmatter for diplomats, not a private class action. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f35 \n\n2.  Dissatisfaction  with  the  manner  in  which \nChina  has  chosen  to  regulate  Vitamin  C  exports  is \nnot  a  basis  for  refusing  deference.    “[T]he  courts  of \none  country  [should]  not  sit  in  judgment  on  the  acts \nof  the  government  of  another,  done  within  its  own \nterritory.”  Underhill, 168 U.S. at 252. \n\nRefusing deference on that basis would also be \nshort-sighted.    In  1916,  our  Federal  Trade  Commis-\nsion  recommended  that  U.S.  exporters  be  permitted \nto fix export prices in order to compete more effective-\nly  internationally.    FED.  TRADE  COMM’N,  REPORT  ON \nCOOPERATION IN AMERICAN EXPORT TRADE 8-9, 379-81 \n(1916),  available  at  goo.gl/hMHbmG.  Acting  on  that \nrecommendation,  Congress  passed \nthe  Webb-\nPomerene  Act,  15  U.S.C.  §§  61-66,  which  authorizes \n(but  does  not  require)  registered  U.S.  associations \nengaged solely in export trade to fix export prices un-\nder an exemption from the antitrust laws.  See United \nStates  v.  Minn.  Mining  &  Mfg.  Co.,  92  F.  Supp.  947, \n965 (D. Mass. 1950).  The United States has also cho-\nsen in a variety of contexts to authorize private firms \nto make industry-wide price and output decisions un-\nder government supervision.16  \n\n16 See, e.g., Horne v. Dep’t of Agric., 135 S. Ct. 2419, 2424 (2015) \n(describing  program  under  which  production  “allocation  is  de-\ntermined  by  the  Raisin  Administrative  Committee,  a  Govern-\nment entity composed largely of growers and others in the raisin \nbusiness appointed by the Secretary of Agriculture”); Yuliva Bo-\nlotova,  Agricultural Supply Management and Antitrust in the \nUnited States System of Agribusiness,  17  INT’L  FOOD  &  AGRI-\nBUSINESS MGMT.

Deference  is  also  important  to  ensure  that \nthe  “the  unnecessary  irritant  of  a  private  antitrust \naction,”  O.N.E.  Shipping  Ltd.  v.  Flota  Mercante \nGrancolombiana,  S.A.,  830  F.2d  449,  454  (2d  Cir. \n1987),  does  not  create  undue  international  friction.  \nIn the past, for example, many of our most important \nallies  –  including  the  United  Kingdom,  Canada, \nFrance,  Germany,  and  Australia  –  have  responded \nharshly  to  perceived  excesses  in  enforcing  U.S.  anti-\ntrust laws extraterritorially. See RJR Nabisco, Inc. v. \nEuropean  Community,  136  S.  Ct.  2090,  2106-07 \n(2016)  (extraterritorial  application  of  U.S.  antitrust \nlaw  has  generated  “considerable  controversy”)  (quot-\ning Empagran, 542 U.S. at 167).17  These perceptions \ncan  make  foreign  governments  less  inclined  to  coop-\nerate with U.S. efforts in cross-border enforcement or \npromoting “America’s antitrust policies . . . in the in-\nternational  marketplace  for  such  ideas.”    Empagran, \n542  U.S.  at  169;  cf.  Daimler  AG  v.  Bauman,  134  S. \nCt.  746,  763  (2014)  (“The  Solicitor  General  informs \n\n17 See, e.g., Joseph  P.

In  today’s  cir-\ncumstances,  for  example,  the  district  court’s  disre-\nspect of the Ministry cannot be helpful in U.S. efforts \nto gain more favorable treatment for U.S. intellectual \nproperty  rights  from  Chinese  authorities.   See gener-\nally  Prepared  Statement  of  the  Federal  Trade  Com-\nmission,  International  Antitrust  Enforcement:    China \nand  Beyond,  at  14,  HOUSE  SUBCOMM.  ON  REG.  RE-\nFORM,  COMMERCIAL  AND  ANTITRUST  LAW  (June  7, \n2016), available at goo.gl/ES49NN. \n\nPetitioners  speculate  that  “opportunistic”  for-\neign  governments  might  appear  in  litigation,  either \nsua  sponte  or  at  the  behest  of  their  nationals,  to \n“shield”  foreign  defendants  from  the  application  of \nU.S. law by “miscontru[ing] their laws” in a way that \nappears  reasonable  but  would  be  revealed as  inaccu-\nrate  under  closer  inspection.18   Pet.  Br.  36-38.    But \nPetitioners  cannot  point  to  an  instance  where  any-\nthing  of  the  kind  occurred;  nor  do  they  explain  why \nthe Second Circuit’s requirement that any interpreta-\ntion  be  supported  and  reasonable  fails  to  protect \nagainst such a manipulation.  China’s requirement of \nprice  coordination  through  industrial  self-discipline \nhad  been  in  effect  for  many  years.    Chinese  compa-\nnies,  moreover,  have  frequently  been  the  target  of \nsuits  in  U.S.  courts,  even  before  this  case  was  filed, \n\n18 Petitioners  also  suggest  that  foreign  sovereigns  could  “engi-\nneer”  results  as  plaintiffs  in  U.S.  courts  that  they  could  not \nachieve  in  their  own  courts.    Pet.  Br.  38-39.    Neither Pink nor \nthe decision below addresses the deference due to a foreign sov-\nereign  when  it  voluntarily  submits  its  own  causes  of  action  to \nthe  jurisdiction  of  a  U.S.  court,  and  that  question  is  not  before \nthis Court. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f38 \n\nbut  China  did  not  appear  in  any  of  them.19   China’s \nappearances  below  instead  underscore  the  signifi-\ncance  that  China  attaches  to  this  case  and  the  seri-\nousness of the district court’s disrespectful treatment. \n\n4.  Deference is particularly important in cases \nsuch as this that involve a legal system  that sharply \ndiverges from our own, with concepts (such as “indus-\ntry self-discipline” and “voluntary” participation) hav-\ning no close counterparts in Western legal traditions.  \nSee JA139-42.  The district court gave token recogni-\ntion  to  the  fact  that  Chinese  law  is  “something  of  a \ndeparture  from  the  concept  of  ‘law’  as  we  know  it  in \nthis country,” Pet.

These  ob-\nservations should have underscored the need for def-\nerence to the Ministry.  Id. 29a.  But instead, the dis-\ntrict court undertook its own evaluation – essentially \ntreating  the  Ministry’s  regulations  as  though  they \nwere the product of U.S. law and relying primarily on \nthe  court’s  own  view  of  their  post-translation  “plain \nlanguage.”  Id. 97a, 116a-17a.

Unsurprisingly,  that  pro-\ncess yielded incoherent and erroneous conclusions.   \n\nII. \n\nTHE  MINISTRY’S  CONSTRUCTION  OF  CHINESE \nLAW WAS CORRECT \n\nA.  China’s construction of its regulatory sys-\n\ntem was logical and coherent \n\nThe  Ministry’s  amicus  brief  on  the  motion  to \ndismiss,  Pet.  App.  189a-223a,  supplemented  by  its \nlater  submissions,  JA127-33,  247-51,  provided  a \ncommon  sense  and  coherent  interpretation  of  the \nregulatory  regime  China  had  imposed.    As  the  court \nof  appeals  said,  the  Ministry  “reasonabl[y]  ex-\nplain[ed]” \n\nthe government’s expectation that private ac-\ntors  actively  self-regulate  to  achieve  the  gov-\nernment’s  policy  goals  in  order  to  minimize \nthe  need  for  the  government  to  resort  to \nstronger  enforcement  methods.  In  this  con-\ntext,  we  find  it  reasonable  to  view  the  entire \nPVC  regime  as  a  decentralized  means  by \nwhich  the  Ministry,  through  the  Chamber, \nregulated the export of vitamin C by deferring \nto  the  manufacturers  and  adopting  their \nagreed  upon  price  as  the  minimum  export \nprice. In short, by directing vitamin C manu-\nfacturers  to  coordinate  export  prices  and \nquantities  and  adopting  those  standards  into \nthe  regulatory  regime,  the  Chinese  Govern-\nment  required  Defendants  to  violate  the \nSherman Act. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f40 \n\nPet.  App.  28a.  The  contrary  interpretation  urged  by \nPetitioners  and  the  district  court,  in  contrast,  was \n“nonsensical,” as it described a system that would col-\nlapse before it even began.  Id. 27a-28a. \n\nB.  China’s  representations  to  the  WTO  are \nentirely  consistent  with  its  position  in \nthis case \n\n1.  A  crucial  error  that  has  infected  this  case \nfrom  the  outset  is  the  idea  that  China’s  representa-\ntions  to  the  WTO  were  inconsistent  with  its  argu-\nments  in  this  case  –  that  giving  up  “export  admin-\nistration”  meant  giving  up  industrial  self-discipline \nand price coordination.  That error was critical to the \ndistrict court’s decision, Pet. App. 74a, 120a-21a, and \nhas been unfortunately repeated here by some of Pe-\ntitioners’  amici.    See,  e.g.,  AAI  Br.  16.    By  asserting \nthat  China  was  speaking  out  of  both  sides  of  its \nmouth, Petitioners have tried to bring this case with-\nin the rule suggested by McNab, 331 F.3d at 1233-35, \nthat  deference  is  not  owed  when  the  foreign  sover-\neign’s statements are inconsistent. \n\nThere  is  not  and  has  never  been  any  incon-\nsistency.    China  never  said  that  it  had  given  up  in-\ndustrial self-discipline and price coordination when it \nentered the WTO.  See p. 12 above.  What it gave up \nwas  the  requirement  that  exporters  of  Vitamin  C  be \nsubject to discretionary licensing or company-specific \nexport  quotas.  JA90,  160,  162,  165,  319,  428-29.  \nNothing  in  the  WTO’s  trade  reviews  and  nothing  in \nthe  later  submissions  by  the  United  States  (or  the \nother complainants) indicated that China had agreed \nto  abandon  industrial  self-discipline  or  price  and \nquantity coordination.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f41 \n\n2.  This  made-up  inconsistency  is  the  only  in-\n\nconsistency offered by Petitioners or any of the amici.  \nBecause there was in fact no inconsistency at all, the \narguments  that  the  Ministry  is  not  entitled  to  defer-\nence on that basis necessarily fail. \n\nC.  The WTO Raw Materials proceedings con-\nfirm  the  appropriateness  of  deference  to \nthe Ministry in this case \n\n1.  The WTO “Raw Materials” proceedings con-\nfirmed both that the requirement to fix prices contin-\nued  throughout  the  class  period,  and  that  deference \nto the Ministry was appropriate.   \n\nThe proceedings related to bauxite, phosphorus, \nand  other  similar  materials.    These  products  were \nunder the auspices of a different chamber of the Min-\nistry,  the  Chamber  of  Commerce  of  Metals  Minerals \n& Chemicals Importers & Exporters (“CCCMC”).   \n\nThat Chamber had a variety of responsibilities, \nincluding  the  promotion  of  industry  self-discipline \nand coordinating prices among the members.  JA685-\n91.  In those respects, its operations were identical to \nthose  of  the  Chamber  at  issue  here.    See  US-WTO \nSubmission ¶ 208. \n\nAt  the  WTO,  the  United  States,  Europe,  and \nMexico – as complainants – explained “that China co-\nordinates  export  prices  for  the  products  at  issue \nthrough a ‘system of self-discipline’ based on informal \nstatements and oral agreements between traders and \nexport  regulators  and  where  the  CCCMC  directs \ncommodity-specific  branches  or  coordination  groups.” \nJA676.   \n\nThe  only  disagreement  on  this  issue  was \nwhether,  as  China  argued,  price-fixing  was  only \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f42 \n\nmandated through 2008, when the PVC system ended, \nor  whether  it  continued  into  2010.    JA677-79.20   The \nWTO  Panel  sided  with  the  complainants,  concluding \nthat “China require[d] exporting enterprises to export \nat  set  or  coordinated  export  prices  or  otherwise  face \npenalties” through 2010.  JA722.21   \n\nThe submission of the United States focused on \nhow  the  CCCMC  effectively  mandated  the  price-\nfixing regime.  As the United States explained, “Chi-\nna’s Chambers of Commerce . . . play a central role in \nregulating  the  trade  of  China’s  industries.”    See  US-\nWTO  Submission  ¶  207.    It  identified  “the  coordina-\ntion  of  export  prices”  as  one  of  “the  key  areas  in \nwhich the CCCMC coordinates export activities,” add-\ning that “the industry coordinated export price is con-\nsidered  ‘a  collective  contract’  that  industry  members \nmust abide by.”  Id. ¶¶ 210, 217.  The United States \nalso  explained  how  the  PVC  system  mandated  price-\nfixing: \n\nThe PVC procedure requires exporters of yel-\nlow  phosphorus  to  submit  their  export  con-\ntracts  to  the  CCCMC  for  “verification.”  The \nCCCMC  is  required  to  examine  the  export \n\n20 Throughout the WTO proceedings, price-fixing was never dis-\nputed.    One  issue  was  whether  the  compulsion  of  price-fixing \nviolated  China’s  obligations  under  Art.  XI:1  of  the  General \nAgreement on Tariffs and Trade (“GATT”).  China argued that it \ndid not, but the WTO Panel concluded otherwise.  JA722-24.   \n\n21 The Panel’s factual findings were upheld by the WTO’s appel-\nlate body, but the conclusions as to whether the price-fixing and \nsome  other  measures  violated  GATT  were  vacated  because  of \nthe  lack  of  specificity  in  the  complainants’  original  complaints.  \nReports of the Appellate Body, China – Measures Related to the \nExportation of Various Raw Materials,  WT/DS394,  WT/DS395, \nWT/DS398 (Jan. 30, 2012), available at goo.gl/ZvH6AK. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f43 \n\ncontracts and verify that the contracts comply \nwith  relevant  regulations  and  industry  coor-\ndination,  including  the  industry  coordinated \nexport  price.  Where  the  CCCMC  verifies  the \nelements  of  a  particular  export  contract,  in \nparticular the export price, are in compliance, \nit  must  affix  its  PVC  chop  (i.e.,  its  seal  or \nstamp)  to  a  special  PVC  form and  to  the  ex-\nport contract where the prices and quantities \nare  indicated.  The  CCCMC  must  return  the \ncontract  to  the  exporter  within  three  days. \nOnce the exporter receives the verified export \ncontract  bearing  the  CCCMC’s  PVC  chop,  it \nmust  declare  the  contract  to  Customs  for \nclearance.  Customs  is  required  to  deny  clear-\nance for any export contracts that do not bear \nthe CCCMC’s PVC chop.22 \n\nId.¶ 224.  The other complainant submissions were to \nthe  same  effect.    E.g.,  First  Written  Submission  by \nthe European Union, China – Measures Related to the \nExportation  of  Various  Raw  Materials,  WT/DS394, \nWT/DS395,  WT/DS398  ¶¶  356-57,  360-68  (June  1, \nat \n2010) \ngoo.gl/uYjFhX; JA676. \n\n(“EU-WTO  Submission”), \n\navailable \n\n2.  In  this  Court,  the  United  States  seeks  to \nlimit  the  weight  of  its  own  successful  argument  be-\nfore  the  WTO.    U.S.  Br.  31  n.7.    It  argues  that  the \n“proceedings  involved  a  different  record  and  other \n\n22 The WTO Panel endorsed the position taken by complainants \nbut  declined  to  address  the  PVC  regulations  on  the  basis  that \nthey  were  “outside  the  Panel’s  terms  of  reference”  because  not \nspecified in the original complaints.  JA726. The Panel based its \nruling  on  the  broad  requirement  to  “set  or  coordinat[e]    export \nprices or otherwise face penalties.”  JA722-24.   \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f44 \n\ncommodities,”  and  that  the  legal  standard  only  re-\nquired proof  that  the  price-fixing be  “attributable  to” \nChina,  rather  than  “required.”    Id.    Both  statements \nare true. Neither makes a difference. \n\nIn  every  relevant  respect,  regulation  by  the \nCCCMC  was  identical  to  regulation  by  the  Chamber \nhere.    The  CCCMC’s  job  was  to  oversee  mandatory \nprice  and  output  coordination  by  its  members  and  to \nadminister  the  PVC  system  for  yellow  phosphorous, \nfunctions identical to the Chamber’s in this case. See \nUS-WTO  Submission  ¶¶  208-09.    The  United  States \nidentifies  no  material  differences.  Nor  can  it;  its  ar-\nguments  were  based  largely  on  the  Ministry’s  sub-\nmissions about Vitamin C in this case.  Id. \n\nAs  for  the  “attributable  to”  standard,  the  gov-\nernment ignores the fact that it argued (and the WTO \nand other complainants agreed) that price-fixing was \n“attributable  to  China”  because  it  was  required  by \nChina.    US-WTO  Submission  ¶¶  207,  210,  217,  224.  \nAs  the  WTO  found,  “China  requires  exporting  enter-\nprises to export at set or coordinated export prices or \notherwise face penalties[.]”  JA722 (emphasis added). \n\n3.  At  the  WTO,  the  United  States,  the  Euro-\npean Union, Mexico, and the WTO itself all relied ex-\ntensively on the Ministry’s amicus brief in the district \ncourt  in  this  case.  See  US-WTO  Submission  ¶¶  207-\n08 & passim; EU-WTO Submission ¶¶ 171-72 & pas-\nsim;  JA680-82,  728.   In  related  proceedings,  the  Dis-\ntrict of New Jersey did so as well.  Animal Sci., 702 F. \nSupp.  2d  at  426-29.   No  one  described  the Ministry’s \npositions  as  self-serving,  inconsistent  with  China’s \nrepresentations  to  the  WTO  about  giving  up  export \nadministration,  or  in  any  way  biased  or  inaccurate. \nAll  relied  on  the  Ministry’s  accurate  description  of \nChina’s regulatory system.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f45 \n\nHaving  relied  on  the  Ministry’s  explanation  to \nadvance  its  position  at  the  WTO,  it  is  unseemly  for \nthe United States now to suggest that the very same \nMinistry statements could be unreliable. \n\nIII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  APPROACH \n\nAND OUTCOME \n\n1.  By  asserting  that,  where  compulsion  is  in \nthe defendants’ self-interest, “more careful scrutiny of \na  foreign  government’s  statement  is  warranted,”  and \nthat  the  Ministry’s  statements  were  “a  post-hoc  at-\ntempt  to  shield  defendants’  conduct  from  antitrust \nscrutiny,” Pet. App. 121a, the district court effectively \napplied  a  standard  of  negative  deference.    Foreign \ngovernments  rarely  appear  in  U.S.  cases,  and,  when \nthey  do,  it  is  almost  invariably  to  support  the  inter-\nests  of  their  nationals.    See  Empagran,  542  U.S.  at \n167-68.  To decline deference on that basis is to afford \nno deference at all. \n\n2.  Point  IV  in  Petitioners’  brief  seeks  to  have \nthis  Court  reinstate  the  district  judge’s  rejection  of \nRespondents’  comity  defense.    Pet.  Br.  57-59.    They \nargue that footnote 10 of the Second Circuit’s opinion, \nwhich  they  quote  five  separate  times,  reflects  a  de-\ntermination  by  that  court  that,  but  for  the  deference \nstandard,  the  district  court’s  comity  ruling  was  cor-\nrect.  Pet. Br. 3, 23, 34, 58, 59.  Footnote 10 does not \nbear  the  weight  Petitioners  put  on  it  and,  even  if  it \ndid,  there  would  be  no  basis  to  uphold  the  district \ncourt’s ruling.   \n\nApproving the “careful and thorough treatment \nof the evidence before it” is an approval of the district \ncourt’s  process  (had  China  not  appeared),  not  an  ap-\nproval of its outcome.  Pet. App. 30a n.10.  In fact, the \ncourt  of  appeals  made  clear  that,  separate  from  the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f46 \n\nstandard  of  deference,  the  district  court’s  construc-\ntion  of  the  regulatory  program  made  no  sense.    Id. \n27a-28a (“It would be nonsensical to incorporate into \na  government policy  the  concept  of an  ‘industry-wide \nnegotiated’  price  and  require  vitamin  C  manufactur-\ners to comply with that minimum price point if there \nwere  no  directive  to  agree  upon  such  a  price.”).  The \ncourt  added  that  the  district  court  had  erred  in  sev-\neral other respects as well: \n\nFirst,  it  determined  that  whether  Chinese \nlaw  compelled  Defendants’  anticompetitive \nconduct depended in part on whether Defend-\nants  petitioned  the  Chinese  Government  to \napprove and sanction such conduct. Second, it \nrelied  on  evidence  that  China’s  price-fixing \nlaws  were  not  enforced  to  conclude  that  Chi-\nna’s price-fixing laws did not exist. And third, \nit  determined  that  if  Chinese  law  did  not \ncompel  the  exact  anticompetitive  conduct  al-\nleged in the complaint, then there was no true \nconflict. \n\nId. 30a.  The Second Circuit’s disapproval of these er-\nrors, wholly apart from the standard of negative def-\nerence  the  district  court  employed,  negate  any  argu-\nment that the Second Circuit intended to endorse the \ndistrict court’s analysis. \n\n3.  The  district  court’s  disrespectful  approach \n\nshould be rejected in any event.   \n\nAs  discussed  above  (pp.  38-39),  the  district \ncourt  acknowledged  that  “the  Chinese  law  and  regu-\nlatory regime that defendants rely on is something of \na departure from the concept of ‘law’ as we know it in \nthis  country  —  that  is,  a  published  series  of  specific \nconduct-dictating prohibitions or compulsions with an \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f47 \n\nidentified  sanctions  system.”  Pet.  App.  116a.    Never-\ntheless,  the  court  proceeded  to  reach  conclusions  in-\nconsistent  with  the  counsel  of  those  in  the  best  posi-\ntion  to  provide  direction,  the  Ministry  and  the  ex-\nperts.23  Contrary to the positions taken by amici AAI \nand  Clarke  and  Howson,  the  difficulty  of  construing \ncomplex  foreign  regulations  counsels  greater,  not \nless, reliance on the submissions of the relevant gov-\nernments  –  the  people  responsible  for  administering \nthe  regulations  –  when  available.  See  Stephen  Brey-\ner, THE COURT AND THE WORLD: AMERICAN LAW AND \nTHE  NEW  GLOBAL  REALITIES  92  (2015).  The  district \ncourt’s  faulty  analysis  in  this  case  provides  an  excel-\nlent example. \n\nThe  district  court’s  construction  of  the  regula-\n\ntory  provisions  in  issue  rendered  them  incoherent.  \nAs discussed above, under the court’s construction: \n\n•  The companies were obligated to report “indus-\ntry-wide  negotiated  prices”  but  “defendants \nhad  the  power  to  effectively  suspend  verifica-\ntion  and  chop  simply  by  not  reaching  any \nagreements  in  the  first  instance.”    Pet.  App. \n125a-26a. \n\n•  The  2002  suspension  provision  authorized  the \nChamber  and  Customs  to  suspend  PVC,  but \nthe court found defendants had the “unilateral \n\n23 As  the  court  noted  on  summary  judgment,  “Plaintiffs  do  not \nhave  a  Chinese  law  expert[.]”    Pet.  App.  59a  n.5.    (Petitioners \noffered a declaration from an American professor criticizing the \nweight  of  certain  documents  at  the  motion  to  dismiss  stage, \nJA119-26,  but  did  not  offer  any  expert  testimony  on  what  Chi-\nnese law required at any stage.)  Respondents presented expert \ntestimony  from  Professor  Shen  Sibao  and  Professor  James  B. \nSpeta.  JA134-79;  CAJA370-406.    Their  testimony  was  unrebut-\nted. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f48 \n\nauthority to suspend verification and chop,” id. \n124a  (emphasis  added),  rendering  the  Cham-\nber’s regulatory regime a nullity.  The court al-\nso  concluded  that  the  suspension  provision \ncontinued  in  2003  despite  nothing  in  any  doc-\nument or testimony to that effect. Id. 124a-25a. \n•  “[I]f all the members simply resigned from the \nSubcommittee.  .  .  .  there  would  be  no  price  or \noutput  restrictions  that  [non-members]  would \nbe required to follow.”  Id. 135a.  \n\nJust as the court of appeals determined, id. 27a-28a, \nunder  the  district  court’s  construction,  the  entire  re-\ngime  supervised  by  the  Ministry  and  the  Chamber \nwas unworkable and made no sense.   \n\nIn  contrast,  the  interpretation  provided by the \nMinistry made perfect sense:  Vitamin C exports were \nsubject  to  a  system  under  which  the  exporters  were \nrequired  to  reach  voluntary  “industry-wide  agree-\nments”  on  price,  without  government  involvement  in \ndetermining  the  specific  prices,  and  then  submit  the \nprices to the Chamber and Customs for verification in \norder  to  receive  the  “chop”  required  to  export.    The \nChinese  system  may  (and  certainly  does)  vary  from \nhow Western nations would approach the issues, but \nthe  system  is  coherent,  internally  consistent,  and \nachieves  China’s  policy  goals.    All  this  is  clear  from \nreading  the  applicable  regulations  themselves  –  but \nwas also carefully explained to just this effect by the \nMinistry.  Id. 189a-223a; JA127-33, 247-51. \n\nThe  district  court  asserted  repeatedly  that  a \nnumber of the terms in the regulatory materials and \nthe  company documents  were  susceptible  of  differing \ninterpretations.  See,  e.g.,  Pet.  App.  120a  (penalties \nunder  self-discipline),  124a  (suspension  provision), \n126a-27a (applicability of PVC to output restrictions), \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f49 \n\n128a (requirement to specify prices and quantities to \nreceive  a  chop).    But  rather  than  rely  on  the  sources \nwho would know, i.e., the Ministry (or the experts or \nthe  commentators),  to  address  these  perceived  ambi-\nguities, and rather than interpret the regulatory sys-\ntem  as  one  that  was  workable  and  made  sense,  the \ncourt  simply  reached  outcomes  in  every  instance  fa-\nvorable  to  the  Petitioners  and  adverse  to  China  and \nthe Respondents. \n\nlaw.  One  key  example \n\nBy  bypassing  the  Ministry,  the  district  court \nfound itself making up its own interpretation of criti-\ncal Chinese terms that have no counterpart in Ameri-\nis  “industry  self-\ncan \ndiscipline.”  The  court’s  determination  that  industry \nself-discipline  reflected  an  absence  of  government \ncompulsion  was  contrary  to  any  plausible  reading  of \nthe  plain  language  of  the  regulatory  provisions,  and \nto  the  unanimous  views  of  the  Ministry,  the  expert \ntestimony,  and  independent  commentators  that  self-\ndiscipline  is  a  government  mandate  for  industry \nmembers to go out and reach “voluntary” agreements \non  prices  and  volumes.    Compare  Pet.  App.  79a-80a \nwith pp. 6-7 above. \n\nThe  district  court’s  stated  reason  for  rejecting \nnearly  everything  the  Ministry  had  to  say  was  that \nthe Ministry statements did not cite every regulation \nand did not anticipate the court’s questions and criti-\ncisms.  Pet. App. 119a-22a. But as the advisory com-\nmittee  note  to  Rule  44.1  provides,  “[o]rdinarily  the \ncourt  should  inform  the  parties  of  material  it  has \nfound  diverging  substantially  from  the  material \nwhich  they  have  presented;  and  in  general  the  court \nshould give the parties an opportunity to analyze and \ncounter  new  points  upon  which  it  proposes  to  rely.” \nFED.  R.  CIV.  P.  44.1  advisory  committee  note;  see \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f50 \n\nCharles  E.  Wyzanski,  A  Trial  Judge’s  Freedom  and \nResponsibility,  65  HARV.  L.  REV.  1281,  1296  (1952).  \nThe  district  court  expressly  declined  to  follow  that \nprocedure  here,  giving  neither  Respondents  nor  the \nMinistry  the  opportunity  to  address  the  court’s  con-\ncerns.  Pet. App. 97a & n.24.  It did not even hold oral \nargument on summary judgment. \n\nNotwithstanding  its  rejection  of  the  Ministry, \nthe  district  court  cited  no  provision  of  Chinese  law \nsupporting  its  manner  of  construing  the  regulations \nin  issue.    Its  ruling  even  defied  basic  U.S.  canons  of \nconstruction  –  that  regulations  should  not  be  inter-\npreted  in  a  manner  that  defies  the  plain  meaning  of \nthe terms, that makes no sense, that would defeat the \npurpose of the regulations, or that fails to give effect \nto all of the regulations’ terms.  See Dole Food Co. v. \nPatrickson, 538 U.S. 468, 476–77 (2003) (“[W]e should \nnot construe the statute in a manner that is strained \nand, at the same time, would render a statutory term \nsuperfluous.”); United States ex rel. Eisenstein v. City \nof N.Y., 556 U.S. 928, 933 (2009) (“[S]tatutes [should] \nbe  construed  in  a  manner  that  gives  effect  to  all  of \ntheir provisions.”). \n\nThe  district  court’s  analysis  has  nothing  to \n\ncommend it, and this Court should reject it. \n\nIV.  REGARDLESS  OF  THE  LEVEL  OF  DEFERENCE, \nTHE JUDGMENT SHOULD BE AFFIRMED \n\n1.  In  the  end,  the  level  of  deference  should \nmake no difference.  The Second Circuit’s standard is \nnot  one  of  conclusive  deference  in  all  circumstances, \nand  its  standard  is  entirely  proper.    But  even  if  the \nstandard were one of no deference, as if the Ministry \nhad not even appeared, there is only one appropriate \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f51 \n\noutcome:  dismissal  of  the  complaints  on  the  basis  of \ninternational comity.24 \n\nA  judgment  of  affirmance  is  therefore in  order \neven  if  the  Second  Circuit’s  standard  is  modified  in \nsome  way.    This  question  of  the  proper  disposition \nhere  has  been  argued  by  Petitioners  (Pet.  Br.  57-59) \nand  by  a  few  of  Petitioners’  amici  (e.g.,  AAI  Br.  12-\n16).    Addressing  that  question  is  consistent  with  the \nCourt’s  opinions  in  a  number  of  related  contexts, \nwhere  it  disagreed  with  the  standard  applied  below \nbut affirmed after applying the correct standard.  See \nMonsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Serv. Corp., 465 U.S. 752, \n765-68  (1984);  Kiobel,  569  U.S.  at  108;  Knight  v. \nComm’r  of  Internal  Revenue,  552  U.S.  181  (2008); \nUnited States v. Tinklenberg, 563 U.S. 647 (2011).   \n\n2.  In  considering  whether  to  dismiss  on  the \nbasis of international comity, the sole issue presented \nto the court of appeals was whether Chinese law was \nin  conflict  with  the  Sherman  Act.    Cf.  Hartford  Fire \nIns.  Co.  v.  California,  509  U.S.  764,  798-99  (1993).  \nThe  court  found  that  the  other  factors  “decidedly \nweigh in favor of dismissal,” Pet. App. 34a, and Peti-\ntioners never contested the point.  Annex B. \n\n Petitioners and AAI advance three arguments \nas to why the conduct in issue here was not compelled \nand,  therefore,  that  there  was  no  conflict  between \nChinese and U.S. law.  None has merit. \n\ni.  The first argument is that, because par-\nticipation  in  the  subcommittee  was  “voluntary”  and \ncould  be  terminated,  there  could  be  no  compulsion.  \n\n24 Comity  is  the  only  one  of  Respondents’  defenses  before  this \nCourt.  The court of appeals had no need to reach any of the oth-\ner issues raised by Respondents on appeal.  Pet. App. 37a-38a. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f52 \n\nPet.  Br.  8-12;  AAI  Br.  11-15.    There  is nothing,  how-\never, to indicate that participation by the four leading \nmanufacturers  –  as  distinguished  from  the  newly-\nadded  members  –  was  voluntary  in  any  meaningful \nsense.  The four were all Council members appointed \nfor four year terms with no provision for termination, \nand  the  only  evidence  in  the  record  was  that  they \ncould not withdraw as a practical matter.   See pp. 9-\n10 above.   \n\nEven so, the idea that everyone could refuse to \njoin,  resign,  or  decline  to  reach  agreements  in  the \nfirst  instance  fails  as  well.    That  argument  would \nrender  the  entire  regulatory  regime  a  nullity.    The \nplain  language  of  the  regulations  required  submis-\nsion  of  “industry-wide negotiated  prices,”  JA99,  a  re-\nquirement  that  would  make  no  sense  absent  the  re-\nquirement  to  arrive  at  an  industry-wide  negotiated \nprice.    Pet.  App.  28a.  And  non-members  were  bound \nto  the  industry-wide  negotiated  prices  even  if  they \ndid not participate. JA105-06. \n\nThe ability to withdraw makes no difference in \nany  event.    Just  as  the  ability  to  withdraw  is  no  de-\nfense  in  an  action  for  price-fixing,  e.g.,  United  States \nv. Salmonese, 352 F.3d 608, 615 (2d Cir. 2003); Unit-\ned  States  v.  Hayter  Oil  Co.,  51  F.3d  1265,  1271  (6th \nCir.  1995),  that  ability  cannot  negate  the  fact  that \nChina required a violation of the Sherman Act.  And, \nto  repeat,  withdrawing  members  were  still  bound  by \nthe Chamber’s coordinated prices anyway.  JA106. \n\nPetitioners  effectively  concede  that  the  1997 \nregulatory  regime  compelled  the  companies  to  fix \nprices and limit output.  See, e.g., Pet. Br. 5-6, 8.  But \nthey  identify  nothing  in  the  2002-03  notices,  an-\nnouncements, charters, or anything else that changed \nthe  obligation  to  coordinate  price  and  output,  under \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f53 \n\nthe  Chamber’s  supervision,  in  furtherance  of  indus-\ntrial self-discipline.  Those obligations – and thus the \ncompelled  violation  of  the  Sherman  Act  –  continued \nin full force.  JA53-55, 99-100, 105-06, 183. \n\nii.  Petitioners  and  AAI  assert  that  Re-\nspondents exceeded the “scope” of governmental com-\npulsion  by  agreeing  on  prices  higher  than  anti-\ndumping  minima,  and  by  agreeing  on  output  limita-\ntions, not just price.  Pet. Br. 58 n.19; AAI Br. 12-13. \n\nAs  to  the  scope  of  the  compulsion,  the  govern-\nmental  directive  was  for  the  companies  to  reach \nagreements on prices voluntarily, without having the \ngovernment set a particular price.  See pp. 7-11 above.  \nThe  obligation  was  to  agree  on prices  by  themselves, \nsee  JA55,  not  to  charge  some  dictated  price.    Re-\nspondents  acted  entirely  within  the  scope  of  that \ncompulsion,  and  that  was  what  was  in  conflict  with \nthe Sherman Act.  It has long been bedrock that “con-\nspiracies  under  the  Sherman  Act  are  not  dependent \non  any  overt  act  other  than  the  act  of  conspiring,” \nUnited  States  v.  Socony-Vacuum  Oil  Co.,  310  U.S. \n150,  224  n.59  (1940),  that  “[a]ny  combination  which \ntampers  with  price  structures  is  engaged  in  an  un-\nlawful  activity,”  id.  at  221,  and  that  the  price  level \nestablished does not matter, United States v. Trenton \nPotteries  Co.,  273  U.S.  392,  397-98  (1927);  see  Plym-\nouth  Dealers’  Ass’n  v.  United  States,  279  F.2d  128, \n132  (9th  Cir.  1960)  (“agreed  starting  point”  for  price \nnegotiations  sufficient  to  establish  violation).    Peti-\ntioners and AAI ignore these principles.  \n\nThe  output  argument,  Pet.  Br.  11-12,  fails  as \nwell.  Coordination on output was required under the \n2002  PVC  regime.    The  companies  were  obligated  to \nspecify  to  the  Chamber  “the  prices  and  quantities” \nand the Chamber was required to “verify the submis-\n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f54 \n\nsions  by  the  exporters  based  on  the  industry  agree-\nments.”  JA105;  see  JA59;  CAJA2216-17.    Moreover, \nas  this  Court  has  often  explained,  price  and  output \nare  economically  (and  legally)  the  same.    See  Cal. \nDental  Ass’n  v.  FTC,  526  U.S.  756,  777  (1999)  (“An \nagreement  on  output  also  equates  to  a  price-fixing \nagreement.”)  (quoting  General  Leaseways,  Inc.  v. \nNat’l Truck Leasing Ass’n,  744  F.2d  588,  594-95  (7th \nCir. 1984)); Brooke Grp. Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson \nTobacco  Corp.,  509  U.S.  209,  233  (1993)  (“Su-\npracompetitive  pricing  entails  a  restriction  in  out-\nput.”).    Compelling  price-fixing  is  compelling  agree-\nments  on  output.    Although  the  Chinese  regulations \nspoke primarily about price, their scope encompassed \noutput (as they would have to), and the Chamber su-\npervised  production  quantities  throughout  the  rele-\nvant  period.    See  JA180,  242,  367,  435.    Requiring \ncompanies  to  fix  prices  without  regard  to  output \nwould have made no sense. \n\niii. Petitioners  also  note  the  difficulties  the \nChamber  sometimes  had  in  enforcing  the  agree-\nments, and the occasional cheating.  Pet. Br. 10-11. \n\nLess-than-complete  enforcement  and  cheating \nhave  nothing  to  do  with  whether  Chinese  law  re-\nquired  the  price-fixing  Petitioners  challenge.    Socony \nconfirmed that the violation is the agreement, not its \nsuccess,  and  the  courts  have  consistently  held  that \ncheating is not a defense to a price-fixing charge. See \nUnited States v. Andreas, 216 F.3d 645, 679 (7th Cir. \n2000)  (“[C]artel  members  cheated  each  other  when \nthey  could[.]”);  Hayter,  51  F.3d  at  1274-75;  accord \nPet.  App.  32a  (“[I]nquiring into  whether  the  Chinese \nGovernment actually enforced the PVC regime as ap-\nplied  to  vitamin  C  exports  confuses  the  question  of \nwhat Chinese law required with whether the vitamin \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f55 \n\nC regulations were enforced.”).  Just as cheating can-\nnot negate the existence of an agreement to fix prices, \nit equally cannot change what Chinese law required. \n\nThe  Chamber  did  its  best  to  enforce  the  re-\n\nquirement to coordinate price and output.  JA434-36.  \nIt  is  not  surprising,  however,  that  enforcement \nproved  to  be  difficult.    China  was  moving  from  a \ncommand economy to one in which more private own-\nership was permitted, and companies were experienc-\ning  competition  under  regulation  for  the  first  time.  \n“Cheating”  on price-fixing  arrangements  is  prevalent \nand often economically rational even in the most ma-\nture  economies.    See  2B  PHILLIP  E.  AREEDA  &  HER-\nBERT  HOVENKAMP,  ANTITRUST  LAW  ¶  405b  (4th  ed. \n2014).    That  it  was  observed  in  China’s  nascent  “so-\ncialist  market  economy”  is  neither  surprising  nor  a \nbasis  for  denying  the  compulsory  nature  of  China’s \nregulatory regime. \n\n3.   The  internal  company  documents  cited  by \nPetitioners  do  not  change  the  outcome.    Complaints \nabout  company  noncompliance  with  output  reduc-\ntions,  statements  occurring  in  unrelated  contexts \nsuch  as  “only  honest  fellows  will follow,”  Pet.  Br.  12-\n14,25 and  the  suggestion  that  defendants  need  to  act \n“in a more hidden way” following the initiation of this \nlawsuit, id. 16, have nothing to do with what Chinese \nlaw in fact required.  Disputes about rival compliance \n\n25 The  relevant  passage  describes  general  complaints  about  “il-\nlegal  or  sub-standard  drug  producers”  whose  products  raised \nsafety  concerns.    It  is  not  about  price  coordination  and  is  not \nspecific  to  Vitamin  C.    JA454,  603.    It  was  about  getting  the \nChamber greater authority to “punish companies who engage in \nsmuggling,  tax  evasion  or  who  have  little  credibility”  and  to \n“honor those who are trustworthy” to improve the “credibility” of \nChinese pharmaceutical products.  JA455. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                             \n\f56 \n\nwith  price-fixing  agreements,  and  the  nervous  reac-\ntions  of  Chinese  nationals  sued  for  vast  sums  under \nunfamiliar laws in a country 6800 miles away are not \nsurprising.    Much  less  do  they  suggest  that  price-\nfixing was not required under Chinese law. \n\n4.  In  this  Court,  in  addressing  comity  absten-\ntion,  the  government  criticizes  the  court  of  appeals \nfor  giving  “inadequate  weight  to  the  interests  of  the \nU.S.  victims  .  .  .  and  to  the  interests  of  the  United \nStates  in  enforcement  of  its  laws.”    U.S.  Br.  32  n.8.  \nAs  Petitioners  raised  no  such  arguments  below,  it \nseems  unfair  to  criticize  the  Second  Circuit  for  not \naddressing  them.  But  even  if  the  points  had  been \nraised, they would not properly have affected the out-\ncome. \n\nPlaintiffs’ interests in collecting money and the \nU.S. national interest in enforcing the antitrust laws \nare  present  in  every private  antitrust  case.    There  is \nnothing  unique  about  those  interests  here.    In  con-\ntrast,  the  other  relevant  considerations  are  unique:  \ndefendants were all Chinese companies; all the activi-\nty  took  place  in  China  under  China’s  regulatory  re-\ngime; China has repeatedly explained the importance \nof this case, and has protested the district court’s dis-\nposition  through  official  diplomatic  channels.    The \nconsiderations  favoring  dismissal,  therefore,  are  at \ntheir zenith.  To argue that they are overcome by the \ntypical  interests  at  issue  in  every  case,  whether  do-\nmestic or international, is to argue comity dismissals \nare never appropriate.  This Court has never said any \nsuch  thing,  and  specifically  declined  certiorari  to  ad-\ndress that argument when agreeing to hear this case.  \nSee Pet. i; cf. Hartford Fire, 509 U.S. at 812-22 (Scal-\nia, J., dissenting in relevant part, joined by O’Connor, \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f57 \n\nKennedy,  and  Thomas,  JJ.)  (endorsing  principle  of \ncomity abstention which majority declined to reach). \n\nAs the case now stands, the only issue on comi-\nty  abstention  is  whether  Chinese law  conflicted  with \nthe  Sherman  Act.   See  id.  at 798  (whether there  is  a \n“true conflict” is the “only substantial question in this \nlitigation”).   The  court  of  appeals  correctly concluded \nthat  it  did.    See  Michael  N.  Sohn  &  Jesse  Solomon, \nLingering Questions on Foreign Sovereignty and Sep-\naration  of  Powers  After  the  Vitamin  C  Price-Fixing \nVerdict, 28 ANTITRUST 78 (Fall 2013). \n\n5.  As  the  court  of  appeals  recognized,  Peti-\ntioners’  arguments  amount  to  an  attack  on  China’s \nchoice of regulatory system and the manner in which \nit was implemented and enforced.  Pet. App. 31a-32a.  \nThe  requirement  to  fix  prices  was  stated  unambigu-\nously  in  the  regulatory  documents,  as  was the  struc-\nture  of  the  PVC  enforcement  mechanism.    By  ques-\ntioning  the  level  of  enforcement  by  Chinese  officials, \nand demanding that they do more than they did, Pe-\ntitioners  impermissibly  seek  to  invalidate  “the  effect \nof  official  action  by  a  foreign  sovereign.”  W.S.  Kirk-\npatrick & Co. v. Envt’l Tectonics Corp., 493 U.S. 400, \n406  (1990).  Courts  of  the  United  States  do  not  tell \nforeign  nations  how  to  enforce  their  own  laws,  Un-\nderhill, 168 U.S. at 252-54, and a private class action \ncase  is  not  a  proper  vehicle  for  invalidating  China’s \nmethod of regulating the export of Vitamin C.   \n\nAs  Circuit  Judge  Ginsburg  and  John  Taladay \n\nput it recently, if antitrust enforcers \n\ndo not apply comity in the application of their \nlaws and in limiting the extraterritorial scope \nof their remedies, then international competi-\ntion  enforcement  will  quickly  devolve  into  a \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f58 \n\n“race  to  the  bottom,”  in  which  the  country \nwith  the  most  restrictive  competition  laws \nwill  regulate  commercial  conduct  for  the  en-\ntire world. The effects doctrine is a legitimate \nbasis  upon  which  to  apply  competition  laws \nand  impose  remedies  but,  just  as  an  agency \nconsiders  how  foreign  conduct  affects  its  do-\nmestic  consumers,  it  likewise  should  ensure \nthat  its  remedy  does  not  unnecessarily  affect \nforeign  governments,  agencies,  business  in-\nterests,  or  consumers.  Comity  should  be  in-\nvoked to prevent the effects doctrine from be-\ncoming  a  way  for  one  jurisdiction  to  impose \nits domestic commercial policy on the conduct \nof  businesses  outside  its  borders.  Otherwise \ncompetition  enforcement  turns  from  a  policy \nto protect consumers into a slightly disguised \nway of implementing industrial policy. \n\nDouglas  H.  Ginsburg  &  John  M.

The  Ministry \nhas made no argument about the specific agreements \nproven at trial. Instead, the Ministry has represented \nthat Subcommittee members were required to engage \nin  a  pre-designated  process  if  called  upon  by  the \nChamber,  but  not  to  reach  any  particular  result.  A-\n205-07. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fA-2\n\nANNEX B \n\nPoint II.E of Br. for Plaintiffs-Appellees at 45-46: \n\nE.  DISMISSAL IS NOT REQUIRED AS A MATTER \n\nOF COMITY. \n\nTo  trigger  the  discretionary  comity  doctrine,  a \n“true  conflict”  must  exist  between  U.S.  and  foreign \nlaw  such  that  compliance  with  the  laws  of  both \ncountries  is  impossible.  Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v. \nCalifornia, 509 U.S. 764, 798 (1993). Consistent with \nHartford Fire, foreign law did not require Appellants \n“to  act  in  some  fashion  prohibited  by  the  law  of  the \nUnited  States.”  Id.  at  799.  Appellants  argue  that  a \n“true  conflict”  is  not  required  to  trigger  the  comity \ndoctrine  under  Hartford  Fire,  but  cite  only  two  post-\nHarford  Fire  cases,  neither  of  which  supports  their \nargument. Trugman-Nash, Inc. v. New Zealand Dairy \nBd.,  954  F.  Supp.  733,  736  (S.D.N.Y.  1997)  (true \nconflict  existed);  Metro  Indus.,  Inc.  v.  Sammi  Corp., \n82  F.3d  839,  847  (9th  Cir.  1996)  (no  true  conflict \nexisted). \n\nHere, compliance with both the Sherman Act and \nChinese  law  was  not  only  possible,  it  happened: \nChinese  vitamin  C  manufacturers  did  not  engage  in \nprice fixing prior to the end of 2001; they engaged in \nprice wars until the cartel was formed. A-2005-34; A-\n176  (“Between  May  2000  and  late  December  2001, \nvitamin  C  in  [China]  experienced  the  second  ‘price \nwar’  since  1995”).  The  companies  and  the  Chamber \nalso stopped meeting after 2008. A-1827, lines 2-9. \n\nAppellants  wrongly  claim  the  district  court  held \nthat  Hartford Fire  overruled  O.N.E. Shipping,  Hunt, \nTimberlane, and Mannington Mills. Br.40-41.

The  court  then  expressly  considered  the \nTimberlane  factors,  and  concluded  that  they  do  not \nsupport  abstention  unless  the  government  of  China \nactually compelled the alleged conduct.
