        "In the Supreme Court of the United States \n\nANIMAL SCIENCE  PRODUCTS, INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS \n\nNo. 16-1220 \n\nv. \n\nHEBEI WELCOME PHARMACEUTICAL CO. LTD., ET AL. \n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES  \nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS \n\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n\nThis  Court  granted  certiorari  to  consider  what \nweight a federal court deciding an issue of foreign law \nshould give to a submission from a foreign government \ncharacterizing  its  own  law.    The  United  States  has  a \nsubstantial  interest  in  that  question  because  it  affects \nboth  the  enforcement  of  federal  statutes  and  the  Na-\ntion’s  foreign  relations.    At  the  Court’s  invitation,  the \nUnited States filed a brief as amicus curiae at the peti-\ntion stage of this case. \n\nFEDERAL RULE INVOLVED \n\nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  44.1  provides  as  \n\nfollows: \n\nA party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign \ncountry’s law must give notice by a pleading or other \nwriting.  In determining foreign law, the court may \n\n(1)",
        "2 \n\nconsider  any  relevant  material  or  source,  including \ntestimony,  whether  or  not  submitted  by  a  party  or \nadmissible  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence.  \nThe court’s determination must be treated as a rul-\ning on a question of law. \n\nSTATEMENT \n\nThis  Court  granted  certiorari  to  consider  whether \nand under what circumstances a federal court deciding \nan issue of foreign law under Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure  44.1  must  treat  as  conclusive  a  submission  ex-\npressing the views of the relevant foreign government.  \nThat question can arise in a variety of legal and factual \ncontexts.  In the proceedings below, the defendants in a \nfederal antitrust suit contended that they could not be \nheld  liable  because  Chinese  law  mandated  their  anti-\ncompetitive conduct.  They relied in part on an amicus \nbrief in which an agency of the Chinese government en-\ndorsed that characterization of Chinese law. \n\n1.  Petitioners are two U.S. companies that purchase \nvitamin C.  Respondents are two Chinese exporters of \nvitamin C.  In 2005, petitioners filed a class-action suit \nagainst  respondents  and  other  Chinese  exporters,  al-\nleging that they had violated Section 1 of the Sherman \nAct, 15 U.S.C. 1, by fixing the prices and quantities of \nvitamin  C  exported  to  the  United  States.    Petitioners \nalleged that the conspiracy had begun in 2001 and that \nit  was  accomplished  through  a  membership  organiza-\ntion known as the China Chamber of Commerce of Med-\nicines  and  Health  Products  Importers  and  Exporters \n(Chamber).  Pet. App. 2a, 4a-5a. \n\n2.  Respondents  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint.  \nThey  did  not  deny  that  they  had  fixed  the  prices  and \nquantities  of  vitamin C exported  to  the United  States.  \nPet. App. 163a.  Instead, they asserted that their actions",
        "3 \n\nhad been compelled by Chinese law and that petitioners’ \nclaims  were  therefore  barred  by  the  act  of  state  doc-\ntrine,  the  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  doctrine,  and \nprinciples of international comity.  Ibid. \n\nThe act of state doctrine may bar a claim that would \nrequire  a  court “to declare  invalid [an]  official  act of  a \nforeign sovereign performed within its own territory.”  \nW.S.  Kirkpatrick  &  Co.  v.  Environmental  Tectonics \nCorp., Int’l, 493 U.S. 400, 405 (1990).  The foreign sov-\nereign  compulsion  doctrine  provides  a  limited  defense \nto antitrust liability when a foreign government has re-\nquired the defendant to engage in the specific conduct \nthat violated the antitrust laws.  See Mannington Mills, \nInc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1293-1294 (3d \nCir. 1979).  And in exceptional cases, principles of inter-\nnational  comity  may  justify  the  dismissal  of  a  private \nantitrust suit challenging conduct that occurred abroad.  \nSee id. at 1297-1298.  Here, respondents’ invocation of \neach  of  those  doctrines  rested  on  their  assertion  that \nChinese  law  had  required  them  to  fix  the  prices  and \nquantities of vitamin C exports.  Pet. App. 167a-168a. \n\nThe Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic \nof China (Ministry) filed an amicus brief supporting re-\nspondents’ motion to dismiss.  Pet. App. 168a; see id. at \n189a-223a.    The  Ministry  had  entered  into  a  joint- \ndefense agreement with respondents and the Chamber.  \nId. at 237a.  The Ministry explained that it is “the equiv-\nalent  * * *  of a cabinet level department” and the entity \nwithin  the  Chinese  government that  regulates  foreign \ntrade.  Id. at 190a.  The Ministry stated that the Cham-\nber was a state-supervised entity authorized to regulate \nvitamin  C  exports.    Id.  at  201a.    And  the  Ministry  ar-\ngued that Chinese law in force during the relevant pe-\nriod had “compelled” respondents “to coordinate export",
        "4 \n\nprices and maximum export volumes” on pain of “severe \npenalties.”  Id. at 212a-213a.  \n\nPetitioners disputed  that  understanding  of Chinese \nlaw.    They  noted  that  the  Chamber  had  publicly  de-\nscribed  the  exporters’  agreement  on  vitamin  C  prices \nand quantities as a “self-regulated agreement” that was \nadopted “voluntarily” and “without any government in-\ntervention.”  Pet. App. 173a-174a (citation and empha-\nses  omitted).    Petitioners  also  submitted  evidence  ac-\nquired  through  limited  discovery,  which  in  their  view \nshowed  that respondents  and  other  Chinese exporters \nhad  “voluntarily  restricted  export  volume  and  fixed \nprices for vitamin C.”  Id. at 175a. \n\nThe district court denied the motion to dismiss.  Pet. \nApp. 157a-188a.  The court held that the Ministry’s de-\nscription  of  Chinese  law  was  “entitled  to  substantial \ndeference.”    Id.  at  181a.    But  it  declined  to  treat  the \nMinistry’s  brief  as  “conclusive,”  based  in  part  on  its \nview  that  “the  plain  language  of  the  documentary  evi-\ndence submitted by [petitioners] directly contradict[ed] \nthe  Ministry’s  position.”    Ibid.    Under  those  circum-\nstances,  the  court  found  the  record  “too  ambiguous  to \nforeclose further inquiry” into Chinese law.  Id. at 186a.  \n3.  After  additional  discovery,  respondents  moved \nfor summary judgment, again invoking the act of state \ndoctrine, the foreign sovereign compulsion defense, and \nprinciples of international comity.  Pet. App. 55a.  The \nMinistry submitted a statement reiterating its position \nthat  Chinese  law  had compelled respondents’  conduct.  \nId. at 97a n.24; see J.A. 247-251.  Petitioners cited addi-\ntional evidence supporting their contrary view, includ-\ning  documents  in  which  China  had  represented  to  the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) that it “gave up ‘ex-\nport  administration    . . .    of  vitamin  C’ ”  at  the  end  of",
        "5 \n\n2001.    Pet.  App.  74a  (citation  omitted).    The  district \ncourt  denied  respondents’  summary-judgment  motion, \nconcluding that Chinese law “did not compel their ille-\ngal conduct.”  Id. at 56a; see id. at 54a-156a. \n\na.  The  district  court  explained  that,  under  Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure  44.1, the determination of for-\neign law “is an issue of law” to be decided based on “any \nrelevant  material  or  source.”    Pet.  App.  93a  (citations \nomitted).    The  court  concluded  that  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s characterization of its laws warrants deference, \nbut  is  not  “entitled  to  absolute  and  conclusive  defer-\nence.”  Id. at 97a.  Here, the court accepted the Minis-\ntry’s “explanation of the relationship between the Min-\nistry and the Chamber,” but “respectfully decline[d] to \ndefer  to  the  Ministry’s  interpretation”  of  the  Chinese \nlaw governing respondents’ conduct.  Id. at 117a-118a. \n\nThe district court gave several reasons for declining \nto adopt the Ministry’s view.  First, it emphasized that \nthe Ministry’s submissions had “fail[ed] to address crit-\nical provisions of the [governing legal regime] that, on \ntheir  face,  undermine  its  interpretation.”    Pet.  App. \n119a; see id. at 97a & n.24, 132a-133a.  Second, the court \nnoted that the Ministry’s most recent statement “d[id] \nnot cite” legal authorities, id.at 120a, and that the Min-\nistry’s  earlier  amicus  brief  “was  less  than  straightfor-\nward” because it implied that  a  1997 regime remained \nin force even though that regime had been “superseded” \nin  2002, id.  at  132a n.45.   Third,  the court emphasized \nthat  the  Ministry  had  “ma[de]  no  attempt  to  explain \nChina’s  representations  [to  the  WTO]  that  it  gave  up \nexport  administration  of  vitamin  C”—representations \nthat “appear[ed] to contradict the Ministry’s position.”  \nId. at 121a.  Under those circumstances, the court con-\ncluded  that  “the  Ministry’s  assertion  of  compulsion",
        "6 \n\n[wa]s  a  post-hoc  attempt  to  shield  [respondents’]  con-\nduct from antitrust scrutiny rather than a complete and \nstraightforward explanation of Chinese law during the \nrelevant time period.”  Id. at 121a-122a. \n\nb.  The district court then conducted its own analysis \nof the “traditional sources” for determining foreign law, \nincluding  the  relevant  “governmental  directives”  and \nthe records kept by the Chamber and by respondents.  \nPet. App. 117a & n.36; see id. at 122a-155a.  The court \ndetermined that, although the Ministry may have sup-\nported respondents’ actions, Chinese law did not compel \nthem to fix the prices and quantities of vitamin C exports. \nThe  district  court  concluded,  for  example,  that  ex-\nporters had “unilateral authority to suspend” the legal \nregime  that  assertedly  required  them  to  adhere  to \nagreed-upon prices.  Pet. App. 124a.  The court stated \nthat this authority “standing alone” was “sufficient rea-\nson to deny summary judgment.”  Id. at 125a.  The court \nfurther explained that, even if Chinese law had required \nrespondents to agree on and adhere to minimum prices, \nit  did  not  compel  their  agreements  to  limit  quantities.  \nId. at 126a-127a.  The court stated that the factual rec-\nord reinforced its view, because there was no evidence \nthat Chinese exporters had faced penalties for failing to \nadhere to agreed-upon quantities or for “failing to reach \nagreements  [on  prices  or  quantities]  in  the  first  in-\nstance.”  Id. at 151a; see id. at 149a-151a. \n\nc.  In the absence of compulsion by Chinese law, the \ndistrict court held that respondents were not entitled to \nsummary judgment under any of the doctrines they had \ninvoked.  Pet. App. 98a-115a.  With respect to interna-\ntional  comity,  the  court  determined  that  other  comity \nconsiderations  did  not  support  dismissal  because  this \ncase was “no different than any other worldwide price-",
        "7 \n\nfixing  conspiracy  by  foreign  defendants  that  includes \nthe United States as one of its primary targets.”  Id. at \n102a; cf. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. \n764, 796 (1993) (“[T]he Sherman Act applies to foreign \nconduct that was meant to produce and did in fact pro-\nduce some substantial effect in the United States.”). \n\n4.  The case proceeded to trial, and a jury found that \nrespondents had agreed to fix the prices and quantities \nof  vitamin  C  exports.    Pet.  App.  11a;  see  id.  at  276a-\n279a. 1    The  jury  also  found  that  respondents  were  not \n“actually compelled” by China to enter into those agree-\nments.  Id. at 278a.  The district court entered judgment \nfor petitioners, awarding roughly $147 million in treble \ndamages and enjoining respondents from further viola-\ntions of the Sherman Act.  Id. at 11a.  \n\n5.  The  court  of  appeals  reversed.   Pet.  App.  1a-38a.  \nThe  court  held  that  the  district  court  should  have \ngranted respondents’ motion to dismiss based on comity, \nand it remanded with instructions to dismiss petitioners’ \ncomplaint with prejudice.  Id. at 38a. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals based  its  comity  analysis  on  a \n“multi-factor  balancing  test”  drawn  from  Timberlane \nLumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597, 614-615 \n(9th  Cir.  1976),  and  Mannington  Mills,  595  F.2d  at \n1297-1298.    Pet.  App.  14a-15a.    The  court  focused  pri-\nmarily on the first factor, which asks whether there was \na “true conflict” between U.S. and Chinese law—that is, \nwhether  “Chinese  law  required  [respondents]  to  enter \ninto horizontal price-fixing agreements.”  Id. at 19a. \n\nThe court of appeals stated that the answer to that \nquestion “hinge[d] on the amount of deference” owed to \nthe  Ministry’s  characterization  of  Chinese  law.    Pet. \n\n1   Respondents’  co-defendants  settled  before  or  during  the  trial.  \n\nPet. App. 39a n.1.",
        "8 \n\nApp.  20a.    The  court  acknowledged  that  some  courts \nhave declined to “accept such statements as conclusive.”  \nId. at 20a-21a.  But the court disagreed with those deci-\nsions, holding instead that when a foreign sovereign “di-\nrectly participates in U.S. court proceedings by provid-\ning a sworn evidentiary proffer regarding the construc-\ntion and effect of its laws and regulations, which is rea-\nsonable under the circumstances presented, a U.S. court \nis bound to defer.”  Id. at 25a.   \n\nThe court of appeals then held, based on the Minis-\ntry’s amicus brief, that “Chinese law required [respond-\nents]  to  engage  in  activities  in  China  that  constituted \nantitrust  violations  here  in  the  United  States.”    Pet. \nApp. 27a.  In reaching that conclusion, the court gener-\nally limited its inquiry to the analysis in the Ministry’s \nbrief.  It did not consider the apparently contradictory \nstatements  and  authorities  on  which  the  district  court \nhad  relied,  and  it  did  not  address  the  district  court’s \ncriticisms of the Ministry’s submissions.  Id. at 27a-33a. \nHaving  found  a  true  conflict,  the  court  of  appeals \nstated that the remaining comity factors “clearly weigh \nin favor of U.S. courts abstaining from asserting juris-\ndiction.”  Pet. App. 33a.  The court noted, for example, \nthat respondents are Chinese companies, that their con-\nduct had occurred in China, and that (according to the \nMinistry) this suit had “negatively affected U.S.-China \nrelations.”  Id. at 34a-35a. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nWhen a federal court deciding a question of foreign \nlaw under Rule 44.1 is presented with the views of the \nrelevant foreign government, it should ordinarily afford \nthose views substantial weight.  But the ultimate respon-\nsibility for determining the governing law lies with the",
        "9 \n\ncourt, which is neither bound to adopt the foreign gov-\nernment’s characterization nor barred from considering \nother materials that support a different interpretation. \nA.  Until 1966, federal courts followed the common-\nlaw rule that foreign law must be pleaded and proved as \na fact.  Rule 44.1 abandoned that cumbersome approach \nand sought to align the process of determining foreign \nlaw  more  closely  with  the  process  of  determining  do-\nmestic law.  The rule specifies that issues of foreign law \nmust be decided as questions of law, and it grants courts \nbroad latitude to determine foreign law based on “any \nrelevant material or source.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. \n\nB.  Federal  courts  determining  foreign  law  are \nsometimes presented with the views of the relevant for-\neign government.  Those views always warrant respect-\nful consideration, and they will ordinarily be entitled to \nsubstantial  weight.    But  courts  have  correctly  recog-\nnized  that  the  appropriate  weight  depends  on  the  cir-\ncumstances.    Given  the  diversity  of  foreign  legal  sys-\ntems and the wide range of ways in which foreign gov-\nernments present their views to U.S. courts, those cir-\ncumstances cannot be reduced to a formula or rule.  The \nrelevant  considerations  include  the  interpretation’s \nclarity, thoroughness, and support; its context and pur-\npose; the nature and transparency of the foreign legal \nsystem;  the  role  and  authority  of  the  entity  or  official \noffering the interpretation; its consistency with the for-\neign government’s past positions; and any other corrob-\norating or contradictory materials. \n\nC.  The  court  of  appeals  held  that,  when  a  foreign \ngovernment  “directly  participates  in  U.S.  court  pro-\nceedings” and offers an interpretation that is “reasona-\nble under the circumstances,” “a U.S. court is bound to \ndefer.”   Pet.  App.  25a.   In  applying  that standard,  the",
        "10 \n\ncourt limited its inquiry to the analysis in the Ministry’s \nbrief.    Id.  at  27a-29a.    The  court  thus  effectively  held \nthat a federal court is bound to adopt a foreign govern-\nment’s submission characterizing its own law so long as \nit is facially reasonable.  That rigid rule is unsound. \n\n1.  The court of appeals’ approach departs from the \npolicies embodied in Rule 44.1.  A rule that does not per-\nmit a court even to consider relevant information cast-\ning  doubt  on  a  foreign  government’s  submission  is  in-\nconsistent with federal courts’ responsibility to “deter-\nmin[e] foreign law” based on “any relevant material or \nsource.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  And a rule that a federal \ncourt must accept any facially reasonable litigating po-\nsition  a foreign government  may  assert  concerning its \nown laws is inconsistent with Rule 44.1’s direction that \ncourts are free to look beyond the parties’ submissions \nto reach accurate conclusions about the meaning of for-\neign law. \n\n2.  The  court  of  appeals’  approach  is  also  incon-\nsistent with federal courts’ treatment of submissions by \nU.S.  States  characterizing  their  laws.    This  Court  has \nheld  that  such  submissions  are  entitled  to  significant \nbut not controlling weight.  Nothing in the text, history, \nor  purposes  of  Rule  44.1  suggests  that  a  federal  court \nmust give greater weight to a submission from a foreign \nsovereign than it would give to a similar submission from \na domestic one. \n\n3.  The  court  of  appeals  believed  that  its  rigid  ap-\nproach  was  compelled  by  United  States  v.  Pink,  315 \nU.S. 203 (1942).  In that case, which predated Rule 44.1, \nthis  Court  stated  that  an  “official  declaration  by  the \nCommissariat of Justice” of the Russian Socialist Fed-\neral  Soviet  Republic  was  “conclusive”  evidence  of  the \nextraterritorial  reach  of  a  Russian  decree.   Id.  at  218,",
        "11 \n\n220.  But that statement was premised on a finding that \nthe  Commissariat  “ha[d]  power  to  interpret  existing \nRussian law,” id. at 220, and there was no indication that \nthe declaration—which had been obtained by the United \nStates  through  diplomatic  channels—was  subject  to \nquestion.    The  Court’s  statement  that  the  declaration \nwas  “conclusive”  under  those  unusual  circumstances \ndoes  not  suggest  that  every  submission  by  a  foreign \ngovernment is entitled to the same weight. \n\n4.  The court of appeals also reasoned that a foreign \ngovernment should be afforded “the same respect and \ntreatment that we would expect our government to re-\nceive in comparable matters.”  Pet. App. 26a.  But the \nUnited  States  has  not  argued  that  foreign  courts  are \nbound to accept its characterizations of U.S. law or pre-\ncluded from considering other relevant material, and we \nare not aware of any foreign-court decision holding that \nrepresentations  by  the  United  States  are  entitled  to \nsuch conclusive weight. \n\nD.  Because the court of appeals concluded that the \ndistrict court was bound to defer to the Ministry’s ami-\ncus brief, it did not review “the district court’s careful \nand  thorough  treatment”  of  the  materials  bearing  on \nthe  meaning  of  Chinese  law.    Pet.  App.  30a  n.10.    The \nquestion  whether  the  district  court  correctly  inter-\npreted Chinese law is not before this Court, and we do \nnot take a position on it.  But the materials the district \ncourt identified were, at minimum, relevant to the ques-\ntion  whether  Chinese  law  required  respondents’  con-\nduct.    The  Court  should  therefore  vacate  the  decision \nbelow and remand to allow the court of appeals to con-\nsider that question under the correct standard.",
        "12 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nA FEDERAL COURT DETERMINING FOREIGN LAW IS NOT \nBOUND  BY  THE  VIEWS  EXPRESSED  IN  A  SUBMISSION \nFROM THE RELEVANT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT  \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 provides that a \nfederal  district  court  faced  with  a  question  of  foreign \nlaw should resolve it as a matter of law and may base its \ndetermination on “any relevant material or source.”  A \nsubmission expressing the views of the foreign govern-\nment is highly relevant, and courts should ordinarily af-\nford such submissions substantial  weight.  As in  other \ncontexts, however, the ultimate responsibility for deter-\nmining the governing law lies with the court.  The court \nis neither bound to adopt the characterization urged by \nthe  foreign  government  nor  barred  from  considering \nmaterials that support a different interpretation. \n\nA.  Rule  44.1  Grants  Federal  Courts  Broad  Latitude  \nTo  Decide  Questions  Of  Foreign  Law  Based  On  Any  \nRelevant Material Or Source \n\n1.  Federal courts encounter questions of foreign law \nin many different contexts.  In some cases, choice-of-law \nprinciples point to foreign law as the rule of decision for \nthe  parties’  dispute.    See,  e.g.,  Day  &  Zimmermann, \nInc. v. Challoner, 423 U.S. 3, 3-4 (1975) (per curiam).  In \nothers, foreign law controls or bears upon a specific is-\nsue in a case that is otherwise governed by U.S. law: \n\n•  As this case illustrates, foreign law may in some \ncircumstances prevent the imposition of liability \nunder the U.S. antitrust laws.  See p. 3, supra. \n\n•  The  Lacey  Act  Amendments  of  1981,  16  U.S.C. \n3372(a)(2)(A), impose civil and criminal penalties \nfor the importation of “fish or wildlife taken, pos-\nsessed, transported, or sold in violation of  * * *",
        "13 \n\nany  foreign  law.”    See,  e.g.,  United  States  v. \nMitchell,  985  F.2d  1275,  1279-1280  (4th  Cir. \n1993). \n\n•  A mail- or wire-fraud prosecution may be based on \na scheme to defraud involving foreign property, \nwhich may require “a court to recognize foreign \nlaw to determine whether the defendant violated \nU.S.  law.”    Pasquantino  v.  United  States,  544 \nU.S. 349, 369 (2005). \n\n•  The application of the federal tax laws sometimes \nturns on “foreign law.”  Guardian Indus. Corp. \nv. United States, 477 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed. Cir. \n2007)  (citation  omitted)  (credits  for  payment  of \nforeign taxes).  \n\n•  A contract governed by foreign law may provide \na  defense  to  a  claim  under  federal  intellectual-\nproperty  law.    See,  e.g.,  Bodum  USA,  Inc.  v.  \nLa Cafetiere, Inc., 621 F.3d 624, 625-628 (7th Cir. \n2010). \n\n•  A foreign law prohibiting disclosure may in some \ncircumstances  excuse  or  affect  the  remedy  for \nnoncompliance  with  an  order  requiring  the  pro-\nduction of documents located abroad.  See Société \nNationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale  v.  United \nStates Dist.  Court,  482 U.S.  522, 544-546 &  n.29 \n(1987) (Aérospatiale). \n\n•  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(f ), which gov-\nerns  service  of  process  in  a  foreign  country,  in-\ncorporates “the foreign country’s law for service \nin that country.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(f )(2)(A); see, \ne.g., Prewitt Enters., Inc. v. Organization of Pe-\ntroleum Exporting Countries, 353 F.3d 916, 923-",
        "14 \n\n924 & n.11 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. \n814 (2004). \n\n2.  English  and  American  common  law  treated  for-\neign law “as a question of fact to be pleaded and proved \nas a fact by the party whose cause of action or defense \ndepend[ed] upon alien law.”  Arthur R. Miller, Federal \nRule  44.1  and  the  “Fact”  Approach  to  Determining \nForeign  Law:    Death  Knell  for  a  Die-Hard  Doctrine,  \n65 Mich. L. Rev. 613, 617 (1967) (Miller).  In 1801, this \nCourt endorsed  the common-law rule, instructing that \n“the laws of a foreign nation” must be “proved as facts.”  \nTalbot v. Seeman, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 1, 37-38 (1801); see, \ne.g., Church v. Hubbart, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 187, 236-237 \n(1804) (“Foreign laws are well understood to be facts.”). \nTreating questions of foreign law as questions of fact \n“had a number of undesirable practical consequences.”  \n9A  Charles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal \nPractice  and  Procedure  §  2441,  at  324  (3d  ed.  2008) \n(Wright & Miller).  Foreign law “had to be raised in the \npleadings” and proved “in accordance with the rules of \nevidence.”  Ibid.  Courts were restricted to the evidence \nsubmitted  by  the  parties.    Ibid.    And  appellate  review \nwas  deferential  and  limited  to  the  record  made  in  the \ntrial court.  Ibid. \n\nAfter the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure  in  1938,  some  federal  courts  began  to  invoke \nstate  procedures  that  departed  from  the  common-law \napproach by allowing courts to take judicial notice of for-\neign law.  Miller 654-656; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a) (1964) \n(incorporating state evidentiary rules).  But those state \nprocedures varied, and some were “time consuming and \nexpensive.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1  advisory  committee’s \nnote  (1966)  (Adoption)  (Advisory  Committee’s  Note).",
        "15 \n\nThe  process  of  determining  foreign  law  thus  remained \n“cumbersome.”  Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 370.  \n\n3.  In 1966, this Court promulgated Rule 44.1 to “fur-\nnish Federal courts with a uniform and effective proce-\ndure  for  raising  and  determining  an  issue  concerning \nthe  law  of  a  foreign  country.”    Advisory  Committee’s \nNote.    The  rule  accomplishes  that  goal  by  providing \nthat, “[i]n determining foreign law, the court may  con-\nsider  any  relevant  material  or  source,  including  testi-\nmony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n44.1.  The rule also specifies that the court’s determina-\ntion “must be treated as a ruling on a question of law,” \nrather than as a finding of fact.  Ibid.2   \n\nRule 44.1 “improves on [the procedures] available at \ncommon law.”  Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 370.  By allow-\ning courts to rely on any relevant material, regardless \nof  its  admissibility  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evi-\ndence,  the  rule  “provides  flexible  procedures  for  pre-\nsenting and utilizing material on issues of foreign law.”  \nAdvisory  Committee’s  Note.    By  specifying  that  the \ncourt’s determination is a conclusion of law, the rule en-\nsures de novo appellate review.  Ibid.  And by providing \nthat courts are not limited to materials submitted by the \nparties,  the  rule  recognizes  that  courts  “may  wish  to \nreexamine  and  amplify  material  that  has  been  pre-\nsented by counsel in partisan fashion or in insufficient \ndetail.”  Ibid.  The “obvious” purpose of those changes \nwas “to make the process of determining alien law iden-\ntical with the method of ascertaining domestic law to the \n\n2   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.1 establishes “substan-\ntially the same” rule for criminal cases.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.1 advi-\nsory committee’s note (1966) (Adoption).  Given that similarity, this \nbrief relies on decisions applying both rules.",
        "16 \n\nextent that it is possible to do so.”  9A Wright & Miller \n§ 2444, at 338-342.  \n\nCourts deciding questions of foreign law under Rule \n44.1 rely on a variety of materials, including “[s]tatutes, \nadministrative  materials,  and  judicial  decisions”;  “sec-\nondary sources such as texts and learned journals”; “ex-\npert testimony”; and “any other information” that may \nbe  probative.    9A  Wright  &  Miller  §  2444,  at  342-343  \n(3d ed. 2008 & Supp. 2017).  In evaluating those materi-\nals, a court “is free  * * *  to give them whatever proba-\ntive  value  [it]  thinks  they  deserve.”    Id.  at  343.    The \nguiding principle is that courts  “should use the best of \nthe available sources” to reach an accurate interpreta-\ntion of foreign law.  Bodum USA, 621 F.3d at 628. \n\nB.  A  Foreign  Government’s  Characterization  Of  Its  Own \nLaw Is Ordinarily Entitled To Substantial Weight, But \nIs Not Binding On Federal Courts \n\nFederal courts deciding questions of foreign law un-\nder Rule 44.1 are sometimes presented with the views \nof the relevant foreign government.  Those views always \nwarrant respectful consideration, and they will ordinar-\nily be entitled to substantial weight.  But the appropri-\nate  weight  in  each  case  will  depend  on  the  circum-\nstances,  and  a  federal  court  is  neither  bound  to  adopt \nthe foreign government’s characterization nor required \nto ignore other relevant materials.   \n\n1.  Federal  courts  considering  questions  of  foreign \nlaw may be presented with the views of the relevant for-\neign government through a variety of formal and infor-\nmal mechanisms.  Often, the foreign state (or one of its \nagencies or instrumentalities) is itself a party to the lit-\nigation.  See, e.g., Northrop Grumman Ship Sys., Inc. \nv.  Ministry  of  Def.  of  the  Republic  of  Venezuela,  575 \nF.3d  491,  496-498  &  n.8  (5th  Cir.  2009);  McKesson",
        "17 \n\nHBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F.3d 1101, \n1108-1109  (D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (McKesson),  cert.  denied, \n537  U.S.  941  (2002),  vacated in part  on  other grounds, \n320  F.3d  280  (D.C.  Cir.  2003);  In  re  Oil  Spill  by  the \nAmoco Cadiz, 954 F.2d 1279, 1289, 1312 (7th Cir. 1992) \n(Amoco Cadiz). \n\nAs  this  case  illustrates,  foreign  governments  (and \ntheir  agencies  and  officials)  may  also  express  their \nviews  through  amicus  briefs  or  similar  submissions  in \ncases where no foreign governmental entity is a party.  \nPet. App. 189a-223a; see, e.g., United States v. McNab, \n331 F.3d 1228, 1239-1240 & n.23 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. \ndenied, 540 U.S. 1177 (2004).  Alternatively, a party may \nsubmit an affidavit or testimony from a foreign official.  \nSee, e.g., United States v. Schultz, 333 F.3d 393, 400-401 \n(2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1106 (2004); United \nStates  v.  2,507  Live  Canary  Winged  Parakeets,  689  \nF.  Supp.  1106,  1109-1110  (S.D.  Fla.  1988).    Or  a  party \nmay rely on an interpretation that the relevant foreign \nsovereign  has  issued  outside  the  context  of  the  litiga-\ntion.    See,  e.g.,  Abbott  v.  Abbott,  560  U.S.  1,  10  (2010) \n(letter from a Chilean agency); Access Telecom, Inc. v. \nMCI  Telecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d  694,  714  (5th  Cir. \n1999)  (circular  issued  by  a  Mexican  agency),  cert.  de-\nnied, 531 U.S. 917 (2000). \n\n2.  Neither  Rule  44.1  nor  any  other  rule  or  statute \nspecifically  addresses  the  weight  that  a  federal  court \ndetermining foreign law should give to the views of the \nforeign government.  As a general matter, courts in de-\nciding such questions should be guided by principles of \ninternational comity, “the spirit of cooperation in which \na domestic tribunal approaches the resolution of cases \ntouching  the  laws  and  interests  of  other  sovereign \nstates.”    Aérospatiale,  482  U.S.  at  543  n.27.    In  other",
        "18 \n\ncontexts, this Court has “long recognized the demands \nof comity in suits involving foreign states, either as par-\nties  or  as  sovereigns  with  a  coordinate  interest  in  the \nlitigation.”  Id. at 546.  To afford appropriate respect for \n“[t]he  dignity  of  a  foreign  state,”  Republic  of  Philip-\npines  v.  Pimentel,  553  U.S.  851,  866  (2008),  a  federal \ncourt  should  carefully  consider  that  state’s  proffered \nviews about the meaning of its own laws.   \n\nGranting substantial weight to the views of the rele-\nvant  foreign  government  is  also  eminently  sensible.  \n“Among the most logical sources for [a] court to look to \nin its determination of foreign law are the foreign offi-\ncials charged with enforcing the laws of their country,” \nwho  are  intimately  familiar  with  the  context  and  nu-\nances of the foreign legal system.  McNab, 331 F.3d at \n1241;  cf.  Bodum  USA,  621  F.3d  at  638-639  (Wood,  J., \nconcurring) (noting the risk that an unaided U.S. reader \nmay  “miss  nuances  in  the  foreign  law”).    Ordinarily,  a \ncourt therefore “reasonably may assume” that interpre-\ntations offered by the relevant foreign agencies or offi-\ncials “are a reliable and accurate source” of the meaning \nof foreign law.  McNab, 331 F.3d at 1241. \n\n3.  The federal courts have generally adhered to the \nforegoing principles.  Courts have recognized that “a for-\neign  sovereign’s  views  regarding  its  own  laws  merit—\nalthough they do not command—some degree of defer-\nence.”  Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan \nMinyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 313 F.3d 70, 92 (2d Cir. \n2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 904 (2003); see, e.g., Access \nTelecom,  197  F.3d  at  714  (“[C]ourts  may  defer  to  for-\neign  government  interpretations.”); Amoco  Cadiz,  954 \nF.2d  at  1312  (“A  court  of  the  United  States  owes sub-\nstantial deference to the construction France places on \nits domestic law.”).  In Abbott, for example, this Court",
        "19 \n\nstated that the views of a Chilean agency were “notable” \nand  “support[ed]  the  [Court’s]  conclusion”  about  the \nmeaning of Chilean law.  560 U.S. at 10. \n\nCourts have not, however, treated a foreign govern-\nment’s  characterization  of  its  own  law  as binding.    In-\nstead,  they  have  recognized  that  the  weight  given  to \nsuch  a  characterization  should  depend  on  the  circum-\nstances.    For  example,  when  “a  foreign  government \nchanges its  original position” or  otherwise makes  con-\nflicting  statements,  a  court  is  not  bound  to  accept  its \nmost recent statement, or the one offered in litigation.  \nMcNab, 331 F.3d at 1241; see, e.g., Export-Import Bank \nof  the  Republic  of  China  v.  Central  Bank  of  Liberia,  \nNo. 15-cv-9565, 2017 WL 1378271, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. \n12, 2017).  A court likewise may decline to adopt an in-\nterpretation if it is unclear or unsupported, if it fails to \naddress  relevant  authorities,  or  if  it  is  implausible  in \nlight of other relevant materials.  See, e.g., Themis Cap-\nital,  LLC  v.  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  626  Fed. \nAppx.  346,  348  (2d  Cir.  2015);  McKesson,  271  F.3d  at \n1108-1109. \n\n4.  In describing the weight that should be given to a \nforeign  government’s  views  about  its  own  law,  parties \nand  lower  courts  have  sometimes  borrowed  domestic \nadministrative-law standards.  See, e.g., Resp. Supp. Br. \n2-3; Amoco Cadiz, 954 F.2d at 1312.  In our view, such \nanalogies are generally unhelpful because those stand-\nards are grounded in domestic considerations.  For ex-\nample,  courts  defer  to  reasonable  agency  interpreta-\ntions  under  Chevron  U.S.A.  Inc.  v.  NRDC,  Inc.,  467 \nU.S.  837  (1984),  in  specific  circumstances,  including \nwhen Congress has “delegated authority to the agency \ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law” and \n“the  agency  interpretation  claiming  deference  was",
        "20 \n\npromulgated in the exercise of that authority.”  United \nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-227 (2001).  The \nstandard  articulated  in  Skidmore  v.  Swift  &  Co.,  \n323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), is more flexible, but it too has  \ndomestic-law  roots  and  a  specific  meaning  acquired \nthrough  repeated  domestic  applications.    See  Mead,  \n533 U.S. at 234-235. \n\nThose  administrative-law  doctrines  do  not  readily \ntranslate to the Rule 44.1 context.  “[T]he world’s many \ndiverse legal and governmental systems” differ greatly \nfrom ours and from each other.  McNab, 331 F.3d at 1237 \n(citation  omitted).    The  views  of  foreign  governments \nabout those varying systems are presented to the federal \ncourts  under  a  wide  range  of  different  circumstances.  \nAnd the submissions themselves differ greatly in their \nformality, thoroughness, and authority.  See pp. 16-17, \nsupra.  Deference standards that were crafted for spe-\ncific areas of federal administrative law and that carry \ndecades of accumulated domestic-law meanings are ill-\nsuited for this very different context. \n\n5.  Rather  than  transplanting  a  standard  from  do-\nmestic  administrative  law,  a  federal  court  confronted \nwith a disputed question of foreign law should proceed \nin the same manner as a court facing any other unset-\ntled  legal question:   By  seeking  to  resolve it  “with  the \naid of such light as is afforded by the materials for de-\ncision at hand.”  Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. \n225, 227 (1991) (brackets and citation omitted).  As this \nCourt emphasized in addressing the analogous problem \nof  determining  the  law  of  former  Mexican  territories \nbefore their annexation into the United States, “it has \nalways been held that it is for the court to decide what \nweight is to be given” to the legal materials available in",
        "21 \n\na  particular  case.    Fremont  v.  United  States,  58  U.S.  \n(17 How.) 542, 557 (1855). \n\nWhen  those  materials  include  an  interpretation  by \nthe  relevant  foreign  government,  that  interpretation \nshould be afforded respectful consideration and will or-\ndinarily be entitled to substantial weight.  The precise \nweight that is appropriate in a particular case will nec-\nessarily  depend  on  the  circumstances.    Those  circum-\nstances  are  too  diverse  to  be  reduced  to  a  formula  or \nrule, but the relevant considerations include the inter-\npretation’s clarity, thoroughness, and support; its con-\ntext  and  purpose;  the  nature  and  transparency  of  the \nforeign legal system; the role and authority of the entity \nor  official  offering  the  interpretation;  its  consistency \nwith  the  foreign  government’s  past  positions;  and  any \nother corroborating or contradictory materials.3 \n\nC.  The Court Of Appeals Erred By Treating The Ministry’s \nAmicus  Brief  As  Binding  And  By  Disregarding  Other \nRelevant Materials \n\nThe court of appeals held that, when a foreign gov-\nernment  “directly  participates  in  U.S.  court  proceed-\nings by providing a sworn evidentiary proffer regarding \nthe construction and effect of its laws and regulations, \nwhich is reasonable under the circumstances presented, \n\n3   As  we  explained  in  our  petition-stage  brief  (at  8-9  n.1),  the \nUnited States’ amicus brief in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. \nZenith  Radio  Corp.,  475  U.S.  574  (1986),  suggested  a  somewhat \nmore deferential approach.  The position we advocate here is con-\nsistent with the United States’ more recent brief in McNab, which \nendorsed  what  had  by  then  become  the  courts  of  appeals’  general \npractice  of  affording  “substantial—but  measured—deference  to  a \nforeign nation’s representations.”  U.S. Br. in Opp. at 16-17, McNab \nv. United States, 540 U.S. 1177 (2004) (No. 03-622).",
        "22 \n\na U.S. court is bound to defer.”  Pet. App. 25a.  In ap-\nplying that standard and concluding that the Ministry’s \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  law  was  “reasonable,”  the \ncourt generally limited its inquiry to the four corners of \nthe  Ministry’s  brief  and  the sources  cited therein.   Id. \nat  27a-29a.    The  court  also  emphasized  that  a  federal \ncourt may not “embark on a challenge to a foreign gov-\nernment’s official representation to the court regarding \nits laws or regulations.”  Id. at 26a.  \n\nIn  practical  effect,  therefore,  the  court  of  appeals \nheld that a federal court is bound to adopt a foreign gov-\nernment’s  submission characterizing its  own  law—and \nmay  not  consider  other  relevant  material—so  long  as \nthat characterization is facially reasonable.4  That rigid \nrule  is  inconsistent  with  the  policies  underlying  Rule \n44.1 and with this Court’s treatment of analogous sub-\nmissions  from  U.S.  States.    And  the  court  of  appeals \nerred in concluding that its approach was supported by \nUnited States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203 (1942), or by consid-\nerations of comity and reciprocity. \n\n1.  The  court  of  appeals’  rule  of  binding  deference  is  \ninconsistent with the policies embodied in Rule 44.1 \nAs the court of appeals observed, Rule 44.1 does not \nexpressly address the weight a federal court should give \nto a foreign government’s submission characterizing its \nlaws.  Pet. App. 22a.  In at least two respects, however, \nthe court’s approach departs from the policies embodied \nin that rule. \n\na.  Rule 44.1 seeks to align the treatment of foreign \nand  domestic  law  by  providing  district  courts  with \n\n4   The court of appeals left open the possibility that “deference may \nbe  inappropriate”  if  the  foreign  government’s  submission  includes \n“no documentary evidence or reference of law.”  Pet. App. 25a n.8.",
        "23 \n\nbroad  latitude  to  “determin[e]  foreign  law”  based  on \n“any  relevant  material  or  source.”    That  direction  re-\nflects a judgment that “whenever possible issues of for-\neign law should be resolved on their merits and on the \nbasis of a full presentation and evaluation of the availa-\nble materials.”  9A Wright & Miller § 2444, at 351. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals’  approach  is  inconsistent  with \nthat sound policy because it precludes a court from con-\nsidering  other  relevant  material  whenever  it  is  pre-\nsented with a facially reasonable submission from a for-\neign government.  Here, for example, the district court \nconcluded  that  the  Ministry’s  submissions  “fail[ed]  to \naddress  critical  provisions  of  the  [governing  legal  re-\ngime],”  Pet.  App.  119a,  and  that  they  incorrectly  im-\nplied that a superseded legal regime “was still control-\nling,” id. at 132a n.45.  The court also highlighted, inter \nalia,  China’s  statement  to  the  WTO  that  it  had \n“g[i]ve[n] up ‘export administration  . . .  of vitamin C’ ” \nat the end of 2001, id. at 74a (citation omitted), and the \nChamber’s statements that respondents had “voluntar-\nily”  agreed on  prices and  quantities  “without  any gov-\nernment  intervention,”  id.  at  173a-174a  (citation  and \nemphases omitted). \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  did  not  conclude  that  the  dis-\ntrict court’s reliance on that material was substantively \nwrong or irrelevant to the proper interpretation of Chi-\nnese law.  To the contrary, it stated that, “if the Chinese \nGovernment had not appeared in this litigation, the dis-\ntrict court’s careful and thorough treatment of the evi-\ndence    * * *    would  have  been  entirely  appropriate.”  \nPet. App. 30a n.10.  But because the Ministry had filed \na brief that the court deemed facially reasonable, it con-\ncluded that the district court had erred by considering",
        "24 \n\nadditional material and thereby “embark[ing] on a chal-\nlenge to [the Ministry’s] official representation.”  Id. at \n26a.    A  standard  that  does  not  permit  a  court  even  to \nconsider such relevant information is inconsistent with \nfederal  courts’  responsibility  to  “determin[e]  foreign \nlaw” based on “any relevant material or source.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 44.1. \n\nb.  The court of appeals also departed from the poli-\ncies embodied in Rule 44.1 by placing dispositive weight \non  the  fact  that  the  Ministry  had  “directly  partici-\npate[d]”  in  the  litigation  by  offering  what  the  court \ncalled a “sworn evidentiary proffer.”  Pet. App. 25a; see \nid.  at  23a  (distinguishing  a  case  in  which  the  foreign \ngovernment “did not appear before the court”).  That is \ntrue for two reasons. \n\nFirst,  the  court  of  appeals’  characterization  of  the \nMinistry’s submission as “a sworn evidentiary proffer,” \nPet.  App.  25a,  was  inapt.    Rule  44.1  abrogated  the  \ncommon-law  rule  treating  questions  of  foreign  law  as \nquestions of fact, and it specifies that a district court’s \ndetermination  of  an  issue  of  foreign  law  “must  be \ntreated as a ruling on a question of law.”  Although the \nMinistry’s amicus brief was surely relevant to the dis-\ntrict  court’s  determination  whether  Chinese  law  re-\nquired the anticompetitive conduct at issue in this case, \nthat legal brief was neither a “sworn” document nor an \n“evidentiary proffer.”  See Pet. Br. 35-36.  By the same \ntoken,  a  court  that  considers  but  ultimately  rejects  a \nforeign  government’s  characterization  of  its  laws  does \nnot  thereby  accuse  the  foreign  government  of  misrep-\nresenting the pertinent facts.  Cf. pp. 26-27, infra (ex-\nplaining that federal courts give significant but not con-\ntrolling weight to a state attorney general’s characteri-\nzation of state law).",
        "25 \n\nSecond,  the  court  of  appeals  erred  by  holding  that \ngreater  deference  is  required  when  a  foreign  govern-\nment participates directly in  litigation.  That  fact  may \nbear on the weight a foreign government’s views should \nreceive.  It ensures, for example, that the government \nhas focused on the specific foreign-law issue that is ac-\ntually  before  the  court.    But  many  other  factors  also \nbear on the weight that should be afforded to a foreign \ngovernment’s  interpretation,  see  p. 21,  supra,  and  the \ncourt of appeals did not explain why it placed dispositive \nweight  on  this  single  consideration.    In  some  circum-\nstances, moreover, a U.S. court might justifiably view a \npronouncement  prepared  for  litigation  purposes  with \ngreater  skepticism  than  it  would  view  a  similar  pro-\nnouncement  drafted  with  no  specific  controversy  in \nmind.  Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. \n204, 213 (1988) (“Deference to what appears to be noth-\ning more than an agency’s convenient litigating position \nwould be entirely inappropriate.”). \n\nThe court of appeals’ rule, moreover, would automat-\nically  inure  to  the  benefit  of  any  foreign  government \nthat appears in U.S. court as a plaintiff or defendant in \na  case  controlled  in  whole  or  in  part  by  its  domestic \nlaws—a relatively common occurrence.5  The court iden-\ntified  no  sound  reason  why  a  federal  court  should  be \n\n5   See, e.g., Themis Capital, 626 Fed. Appx. at 348 (suit against the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo to recover debt); Karaha Bodas, 313 \nF.3d  at  75,  92  (action  to  execute  on  assets  owned  by  Indonesia); \nNorthrop  Grumman  Ship  Sys.,  575  F.3d  at  496-498  &  n.8  (suit \nagainst Venezuela for contract damages claimed to be governed in \npart by Venezuelan law); McKesson, 271 F.3d at 1103 (suit against \nIran arising out of expropriation of property); DRC, Inc. v.

Supp.  2d  452,  460-461  (S.D.N.Y.",
        "26 \n\nbound,  in  any  suit  to  which  a  foreign  government  is  a \nparty,  by  whatever  facially  reasonable  litigating  posi-\ntion that party may assert concerning the proper under-\nstanding of its own laws.  That result would be particu-\nlarly anomalous because Rule 44.1 allows courts to look \nbeyond the “material presented by the parties” specifi-\ncally  to  ensure  that  courts  have  the  ability  to  “reex-\namine  and  amplify  material  that  has  been  presented  \nby counsel in partisan fashion or in insufficient detail.”  \nAdvisory Committee Note.  That consideration applies \nwith full force when the litigant is a foreign government. \n\n2.  The  court  of  appeals’  rule  of  binding  deference  is  \ninconsistent with this Court’s treatment of analogous \nsubmissions from U.S. States \n\nThe court of appeals’ rule of binding deference is in-\nconsistent with this Court’s approach in the other prin-\ncipal  circumstance  in  which  federal  courts  are  pre-\nsented with the views of other sovereigns on the proper \ninterpretation  of  their  laws.    When  federal  courts  re-\nceive  submissions by U.S. States addressing the proper \ninterpretation of state law, the courts give those submis-\nsions significant but not controlling weight.  Nothing in \nthe text, history, or purposes of Rule 44.1 suggests that \na  federal  court  determining  foreign  law  must  give \ngreater weight to the views of a foreign sovereign.  \n\nThis Court has long held that “[t]he law of any State \nof the Union  * * *  is a matter of which the courts of the \nUnited States are bound to take judicial notice, without \nplea  or  proof.”    Lamar  v.  Micou,  114  U.S.  218,  223 \n\n2007) (suit by Ecuador seeking to stay arbitration); Republic of Tur-\nkey v. OKS Partners, 146 F.R.D. 24, 27-28 (D. Mass. 1993) (suit by \nTurkey to recover artifacts); Government of Peru v.  Johnson, 720 \nF. Supp. 810, 812-814 (C.D. Cal. 1989) (same by Peru).",
        "27 \n\n(1885).  If the applicable state law is established by a de-\ncision  of  “the  State’s  highest  court,”  that  decision  is \n“binding on the federal courts.”  Wainwright v. Goode, \n464 U.S. 78, 84 (1983) (per curiam); see Mullaney v. Wil-\nbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).  Otherwise, a federal court \nmust “consider all of the available legal sources” to pre-\ndict  “how  the  state’s  highest  court  would  answer  the \nopen questions.”  19 Wright & Miller § 4507, at 178-179 \n(3d ed. 2016); see Salve Regina Coll., 499 U.S. at 227. \n\nIn  deciding  questions  of  state  law,  the  views  of  the \nState as expressed by its attorney general are “entitled \nto weight.”  19 Wright & Miller § 4507, at 157-158; see \nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, \n76 n.30 (1997) (citing with approval an opinion conclud-\ning  that  the  “reasoned  opinion  of  [a]  State  Attorney \nGeneral should be accorded respectful consideration”).  \nThis  Court  has  made  clear,  however,  that  those  views \nare  not  entitled  to  “controlling  weight.”    Stenberg  v. \nCarhart, 530 U.S. 914, 940 (2000); see, e.g., Virginia v. \nAmerican Booksellers Ass’n., 484 U.S. 383, 395 (1988).  \nThe court of appeals gave no sound reason for requiring \nthat federal courts give greater weight to the views of \nforeign governments. \n\n3.  This  Court’s  decision  in  Pink  does  not  support  the \n\ncourt of appeals’ rule of binding deference \n\nThe court of appeals believed that its rigid approach \nwas compelled by this Court’s pre-Rule 44.1 decision in \nPink.  Pet. App. 20a, 22a-23a.  That is not correct.  Pink \narose out of an action brought by the United States to \nrecover assets of the U.S. branch of a Russian insurance \ncompany  that  had  been  nationalized  in  1918  after  the \nRussian revolution.  315 U.S. at 210.  In 1933, the gov-\nernment of the Soviet Union assigned the nationalized \nassets to the United States.  Id. at 211.  The disposition",
        "28 \n\nof  the  case  turned  on  the  extraterritorial  effect  of  the \nnationalization  decree—specifically,  whether  the  de-\ncree  had  reached  the  assets  of  the  Russian  insurance \ncompany  located  in  the  United  States,  or  instead  had \nbeen limited to property in Russia.  Id. at 213-215, 217. \nTo  support  its  position  that  the  nationalization  de-\ncree had reached all of the company’s assets, the United \nStates obtained an “official declaration by the Commis-\nsariat for Justice” of the Russian Socialist Federal So-\nviet Republic.  Pink, 315 U.S. at 218.   The declaration \ncertified  that  the  decree  had  reached  “the  funds  and \nproperty of former insurance companies  * * *  irrespec-\ntive of whether it was situated within the territorial lim-\nits of [Russia] or abroad.”  Id. at 220 (citation omitted).  \nThis  Court  held that  “the evidence  supported  [a]  find-\ning” that “the Commissariat for Justice ha[d] power to \ninterpret  existing  Russian  law.”    Ibid.    “That  being \ntrue,” the Court concluded that the “official declaration \n[wa]s conclusive so far as the intended extraterritorial \neffect of the Russian decree [wa]s concerned.”  Ibid. \n\nThis Court’s treatment of the declaration as conclu-\nsive was thus premised on an independent finding about \nthe  Commissariat’s  authority  within  the  Soviet  legal \nsystem.  Pink, 315 U.S. at 220.  The declaration was also \nobtained  by  the  United  States,  through  official  “diplo-\nmatic channels.”  Id. at 218.  The Commissariat’s decla-\nration was thus in some respects akin to a state supreme \ncourt’s  answer  to  a  question  of  state  law  certified  by  \na  federal  court.    Cf.  Arizonans  for  Official  English,  \n520 U.S. at 76-77.  There was apparently no indication \nthat the declaration was incomplete or inconsistent with \nthe Soviet Union’s past statements, and the Court em-\nphasized that the declaration was consistent with expert \nevidence  that  “gave  great  credence  to  [the]  position”",
        "29 \n\nthat  the  nationalization  decree  reached  property  lo-\ncated abroad.  Pink, 315 U.S. at 218.  The Court’s state-\nment that the Commissariat’s declaration was “conclu-\nsive” under those unusual circumstances does not sug-\ngest that every submission by a foreign government is \nentitled to the same weight. \n\n4.  Considerations  of  reciprocity  and  comity  do  not  \nsupport the court of appeals’ rule of binding deference \nThe  court  of  appeals  also  reasoned  that  a  foreign \ngovernment’s characterization of its own laws should be \nafforded  “the  same  respect  and  treatment  that  we \nwould expect our government to receive in comparable \nmatters.”  Pet. App. 26a.  That concern for reciprocity \nwas sound, but it does not support the court’s approach.  \nIn fact, the opposite is true. \n\nWhen  the  United  States  litigates  questions  of  U.S. \nlaw  in  foreign  tribunals, it expects  that the views sub-\nmitted on its behalf will be afforded substantial weight, \nand  that  its  characterizations  of  U.S.  law  will  be  ac-\ncepted  because  they  are  accurate  and  well-supported.  \nBut the United States historically has not argued that \nforeign courts are bound to accept its characterizations \nor precluded from considering other relevant material. 6  \nAnd although other nations’ approaches to determining \nforeign law vary, we are not aware of any foreign-court \ndecision  holding  that  representations  by  the  United \nStates are entitled to such conclusive weight.  \n\n6   Respondents  assert  (Supp.  Br.  7-8)  that  the  United  States \nsought a greater degree of deference in a 2002 submission to a WTO \npanel.  In fact, that submission acknowledged that “the Panel is not \nbound  to  accept  the  interpretation  [of  U.S.  law]  presented  by  the \nUnited States.”  Second Written Submission of the United States of \nAmerica, United States—Section 129(c)(1) of the Uruguay Round \nAgreements Act, WT/DS221 ¶ 11 (Mar. 8, 2002).",
        "30 \n\nThe  understanding  that  a  government’s  expressed \nview of its own law is ordinarily entitled to substantial \nbut not conclusive weight is also consistent with two in-\nternational  treaties  that  establish  formal  mechanisms \nby which one government may obtain from another an \nofficial  statement  characterizing  its  laws.    Those  trea-\nties specify that “[t]he information given in reply shall \nnot bind  the  judicial  authority  from  which  the  request \nemanated.”    European  Convention  on  Information  on \nForeign Law art. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 147, 154; \nsee  Organization  of  American  States,  Inter-American \nConvention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on  Foreign \nLaw  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  O.A.S.T.S.  No.  53,  1439 \nU.N.T.S. 107, 111 (similar).  Although the United States \nis not a party to those treaties, they reflect an interna-\ntional practice that is inconsistent with the court of ap-\npeals’ approach, and they confirm that the court’s rule \nof binding deference is not supported by considerations \nof international comity.  \n\nD.  This  Court  Should  Vacate  The  Decision  Below  And  \nRemand  The  Case  To  Allow  The  Court  Of  Appeals  To \nApply The Correct Legal Standard \n\nBecause the court of appeals concluded that the dis-\ntrict court was bound to defer to the Ministry’s amicus \nbrief, the court did not consider the shortcomings that \nthe  district  court  had  identified  in  the  Ministry’s  sub-\nmissions  or  the  other  aspects  of  “the  district  court’s \ncareful and thorough treatment of the evidence before \nit.”  Pet. App. 30a n.10.  The question whether the dis-",
        "31 \n\ntrict court correctly interpreted Chinese law is not be-\nfore this Court, and we do not take a position on it. 7  But \nthe  materials  identified  by  the  district  court  were,  at \nminimum,  relevant  to  the  weight  that  the  Ministry’s \nsubmissions should receive and to the question whether \nChinese law required respondents’ conduct.  This Court \nshould therefore vacate the decision below and remand  \n\n7   Respondents  are  wrong  in  stating  (Supp.  Br.  6-7)  that  the \nUnited States “affirmed” their interpretation of Chinese law in pro-\nceedings before the WTO.  Those proceedings involved a different \nrecord  and  other  commodities,  not  vitamin  C.    See  First  Written \nSubmission  of  the  United  States  of  America,  China—Measures  \nRelated  to  the  Exportation  of  Various  Raw  Materials,  DS394, \nDS395, DS398 ¶ 4 (June 1, 2010).  Based on China’s representations \nto the district court in this case—which were against China’s inter-\nest in the WTO proceeding—the United States argued that export \nrestraints  adopted  by  a  different  China  Chamber  of  Commerce \nwere  “attributable  to  China”  for  purposes  of  China’s  compliance \nwith  its  WTO  obligations.    Id.  ¶  208.    But  in  addition  to  involving \ndifferent commodities and a different record, the WTO proceeding \nwas governed by a different legal standard.  This litigation has fo-\ncused on the question whether Chinese law required respondents to \nfix the prices and output of vitamin C exports.  In contrast, as the \nWTO panel explained, “[p]rivate actions” have been “found to be ‘at-\ntributable’ to a government, and thus subject to challenge [in WTO \nproceedings],  where  there  is  ‘some  governmental  connection  to  \nor  endorsement  of  those  actions.’ ”    World  Trade  Organization, \nChina—Measures Related to the Exportation of Various Raw Ma-\nterials:  Reports of the Panel, WT/DS394/R, WT/DS395/R, WT/DS398/R \n¶ 7.1004 (July 5, 2011) (citation omitted).  That standard may be sat-\nisfied even where a nation’s law does not require the relevant pri-\nvate conduct.",

As  we \nexplained at the petition stage  (Br.  20), the court’s comity analysis \nwas erroneous in other respects as well.  For example, the court gave \ninadequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims of the alleged \nprice-fixing  cartel  and  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States  in  en-\nforcement of its laws.  Pet. App. 34a-35a.  Conversely, the court gave \ntoo much weight to China’s objections to this suit.  Id. at 35a.  Unlike \na  statement  from  the  Executive  Branch  of  the  U.S.  government,  a \nforeign sovereign’s objection to a suit does not, in itself, necessarily \nindicate that the case will harm U.S. foreign relations."

LTD., ET AL. \n\nON WRIT OF CERTIORARI \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES  \nAS AMICUS CURIAE SUPPORTING PETITIONERS \n\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n\nThis  Court  granted  certiorari  to  consider  what \nweight a federal court deciding an issue of foreign law \nshould give to a submission from a foreign government \ncharacterizing  its  own  law.    The  United  States  has  a \nsubstantial  interest  in  that  question  because  it  affects \nboth  the  enforcement  of  federal  statutes  and  the  Na-\ntion’s  foreign  relations.    At  the  Court’s  invitation,  the \nUnited States filed a brief as amicus curiae at the peti-\ntion stage of this case. \n\nFEDERAL RULE INVOLVED \n\nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  44.1  provides  as  \n\nfollows: \n\nA party who intends to raise an issue about a foreign \ncountry’s law must give notice by a pleading or other \nwriting.  In determining foreign law, the court may \n\n(1) \n\n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nconsider  any  relevant  material  or  source,  including \ntestimony,  whether  or  not  submitted  by  a  party  or \nadmissible  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evidence.  \nThe court’s determination must be treated as a rul-\ning on a question of law. \n\nSTATEMENT \n\nThis  Court  granted  certiorari  to  consider  whether \nand under what circumstances a federal court deciding \nan issue of foreign law under Federal Rule of Civil Pro-\ncedure  44.1  must  treat  as  conclusive  a  submission  ex-\npressing the views of the relevant foreign government.  \nThat question can arise in a variety of legal and factual \ncontexts.  In the proceedings below, the defendants in a \nfederal antitrust suit contended that they could not be \nheld  liable  because  Chinese  law  mandated  their  anti-\ncompetitive conduct.  They relied in part on an amicus \nbrief in which an agency of the Chinese government en-\ndorsed that characterization of Chinese law. \n\n1.  Petitioners are two U.S. companies that purchase \nvitamin C.  Respondents are two Chinese exporters of \nvitamin C.  In 2005, petitioners filed a class-action suit \nagainst  respondents  and  other  Chinese  exporters,  al-\nleging that they had violated Section 1 of the Sherman \nAct, 15 U.S.C. 1, by fixing the prices and quantities of \nvitamin  C  exported  to  the  United  States.    Petitioners \nalleged that the conspiracy had begun in 2001 and that \nit  was  accomplished  through  a  membership  organiza-\ntion known as the China Chamber of Commerce of Med-\nicines  and  Health  Products  Importers  and  Exporters \n(Chamber).  Pet. App. 2a, 4a-5a. \n\n2.  Respondents  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaint.  \nThey  did  not  deny  that  they  had  fixed  the  prices  and \nquantities  of  vitamin C exported  to  the United  States.  \nPet. App. 163a.  Instead, they asserted that their actions \n\n \n\f3 \n\nhad been compelled by Chinese law and that petitioners’ \nclaims  were  therefore  barred  by  the  act  of  state  doc-\ntrine,  the  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  doctrine,  and \nprinciples of international comity.  Ibid. \n\nThe act of state doctrine may bar a claim that would \nrequire  a  court “to declare  invalid [an]  official  act of  a \nforeign sovereign performed within its own territory.”  \nW.S.  Kirkpatrick  &  Co.  v.  Environmental  Tectonics \nCorp., Int’l, 493 U.S. 400, 405 (1990).  The foreign sov-\nereign  compulsion  doctrine  provides  a  limited  defense \nto antitrust liability when a foreign government has re-\nquired the defendant to engage in the specific conduct \nthat violated the antitrust laws.  See Mannington Mills, \nInc. v. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1293-1294 (3d \nCir. 1979).  And in exceptional cases, principles of inter-\nnational  comity  may  justify  the  dismissal  of  a  private \nantitrust suit challenging conduct that occurred abroad.  \nSee id. at 1297-1298.  Here, respondents’ invocation of \neach  of  those  doctrines  rested  on  their  assertion  that \nChinese  law  had  required  them  to  fix  the  prices  and \nquantities of vitamin C exports.  Pet. App. 167a-168a. \n\nThe Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Republic \nof China (Ministry) filed an amicus brief supporting re-\nspondents’ motion to dismiss.  Pet. App. 168a; see id. at \n189a-223a.    The  Ministry  had  entered  into  a  joint- \ndefense agreement with respondents and the Chamber.  \nId. at 237a.  The Ministry explained that it is “the equiv-\nalent  * * *  of a cabinet level department” and the entity \nwithin  the  Chinese  government that  regulates  foreign \ntrade.  Id. at 190a.  The Ministry stated that the Cham-\nber was a state-supervised entity authorized to regulate \nvitamin  C  exports.    Id.  at  201a.    And  the  Ministry  ar-\ngued that Chinese law in force during the relevant pe-\nriod had “compelled” respondents “to coordinate export \n\n \n\f4 \n\nprices and maximum export volumes” on pain of “severe \npenalties.”  Id. at 212a-213a.  \n\nPetitioners disputed  that  understanding  of Chinese \nlaw.    They  noted  that  the  Chamber  had  publicly  de-\nscribed  the  exporters’  agreement  on  vitamin  C  prices \nand quantities as a “self-regulated agreement” that was \nadopted “voluntarily” and “without any government in-\ntervention.”  Pet. App. 173a-174a (citation and empha-\nses  omitted).    Petitioners  also  submitted  evidence  ac-\nquired  through  limited  discovery,  which  in  their  view \nshowed  that respondents  and  other  Chinese exporters \nhad  “voluntarily  restricted  export  volume  and  fixed \nprices for vitamin C.”  Id. at 175a. \n\nThe district court denied the motion to dismiss.  Pet. \nApp. 157a-188a.  The court held that the Ministry’s de-\nscription  of  Chinese  law  was  “entitled  to  substantial \ndeference.”    Id.  at  181a.    But  it  declined  to  treat  the \nMinistry’s  brief  as  “conclusive,”  based  in  part  on  its \nview  that  “the  plain  language  of  the  documentary  evi-\ndence submitted by [petitioners] directly contradict[ed] \nthe  Ministry’s  position.”    Ibid.    Under  those  circum-\nstances,  the  court  found  the  record  “too  ambiguous  to \nforeclose further inquiry” into Chinese law.  Id. at 186a.  \n3.  After  additional  discovery,  respondents  moved \nfor summary judgment, again invoking the act of state \ndoctrine, the foreign sovereign compulsion defense, and \nprinciples of international comity.  Pet. App. 55a.  The \nMinistry submitted a statement reiterating its position \nthat  Chinese  law  had compelled respondents’  conduct.  \nId. at 97a n.24; see J.A. 247-251.  Petitioners cited addi-\ntional evidence supporting their contrary view, includ-\ning  documents  in  which  China  had  represented  to  the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) that it “gave up ‘ex-\nport  administration    . . .    of  vitamin  C’ ”  at  the  end  of \n\n \n\f5 \n\n2001.    Pet.  App.  74a  (citation  omitted).    The  district \ncourt  denied  respondents’  summary-judgment  motion, \nconcluding that Chinese law “did not compel their ille-\ngal conduct.”  Id. at 56a; see id. at 54a-156a. \n\na.  The  district  court  explained  that,  under  Federal \nRule of Civil Procedure  44.1, the determination of for-\neign law “is an issue of law” to be decided based on “any \nrelevant  material  or  source.”    Pet.  App.  93a  (citations \nomitted).    The  court  concluded  that  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s characterization of its laws warrants deference, \nbut  is  not  “entitled  to  absolute  and  conclusive  defer-\nence.”  Id. at 97a.  Here, the court accepted the Minis-\ntry’s “explanation of the relationship between the Min-\nistry and the Chamber,” but “respectfully decline[d] to \ndefer  to  the  Ministry’s  interpretation”  of  the  Chinese \nlaw governing respondents’ conduct.  Id. at 117a-118a. \n\nThe district court gave several reasons for declining \nto adopt the Ministry’s view.  First, it emphasized that \nthe Ministry’s submissions had “fail[ed] to address crit-\nical provisions of the [governing legal regime] that, on \ntheir  face,  undermine  its  interpretation.”    Pet.  App. \n119a; see id. at 97a & n.24, 132a-133a.  Second, the court \nnoted that the Ministry’s most recent statement “d[id] \nnot cite” legal authorities, id.at 120a, and that the Min-\nistry’s  earlier  amicus  brief  “was  less  than  straightfor-\nward” because it implied that  a  1997 regime remained \nin force even though that regime had been “superseded” \nin  2002, id.  at  132a n.45.   Third,  the court emphasized \nthat  the  Ministry  had  “ma[de]  no  attempt  to  explain \nChina’s  representations  [to  the  WTO]  that  it  gave  up \nexport  administration  of  vitamin  C”—representations \nthat “appear[ed] to contradict the Ministry’s position.”  \nId. at 121a.  Under those circumstances, the court con-\ncluded  that  “the  Ministry’s  assertion  of  compulsion \n\n \n\f6 \n\n[wa]s  a  post-hoc  attempt  to  shield  [respondents’]  con-\nduct from antitrust scrutiny rather than a complete and \nstraightforward explanation of Chinese law during the \nrelevant time period.”  Id. at 121a-122a. \n\nb.  The district court then conducted its own analysis \nof the “traditional sources” for determining foreign law, \nincluding  the  relevant  “governmental  directives”  and \nthe records kept by the Chamber and by respondents.  \nPet. App. 117a & n.36; see id. at 122a-155a.  The court \ndetermined that, although the Ministry may have sup-\nported respondents’ actions, Chinese law did not compel \nthem to fix the prices and quantities of vitamin C exports. \nThe  district  court  concluded,  for  example,  that  ex-\nporters had “unilateral authority to suspend” the legal \nregime  that  assertedly  required  them  to  adhere  to \nagreed-upon prices.  Pet. App. 124a.  The court stated \nthat this authority “standing alone” was “sufficient rea-\nson to deny summary judgment.”  Id. at 125a.  The court \nfurther explained that, even if Chinese law had required \nrespondents to agree on and adhere to minimum prices, \nit  did  not  compel  their  agreements  to  limit  quantities.  \nId. at 126a-127a.  The court stated that the factual rec-\nord reinforced its view, because there was no evidence \nthat Chinese exporters had faced penalties for failing to \nadhere to agreed-upon quantities or for “failing to reach \nagreements  [on  prices  or  quantities]  in  the  first  in-\nstance.”  Id. at 151a; see id. at 149a-151a. \n\nc.  In the absence of compulsion by Chinese law, the \ndistrict court held that respondents were not entitled to \nsummary judgment under any of the doctrines they had \ninvoked.  Pet. App. 98a-115a.  With respect to interna-\ntional  comity,  the  court  determined  that  other  comity \nconsiderations  did  not  support  dismissal  because  this \ncase was “no different than any other worldwide price-\n\n \n\f7 \n\nfixing  conspiracy  by  foreign  defendants  that  includes \nthe United States as one of its primary targets.”  Id. at \n102a; cf. Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. \n764, 796 (1993) (“[T]he Sherman Act applies to foreign \nconduct that was meant to produce and did in fact pro-\nduce some substantial effect in the United States.”). \n\n4.  The case proceeded to trial, and a jury found that \nrespondents had agreed to fix the prices and quantities \nof  vitamin  C  exports.    Pet.  App.  11a;  see  id.  at  276a-\n279a. 1    The  jury  also  found  that  respondents  were  not \n“actually compelled” by China to enter into those agree-\nments.  Id. at 278a.  The district court entered judgment \nfor petitioners, awarding roughly $147 million in treble \ndamages and enjoining respondents from further viola-\ntions of the Sherman Act.  Id. at 11a.  \n\n5.  The  court  of  appeals  reversed.   Pet.  App.  1a-38a.  \nThe  court  held  that  the  district  court  should  have \ngranted respondents’ motion to dismiss based on comity, \nand it remanded with instructions to dismiss petitioners’ \ncomplaint with prejudice.  Id. at 38a. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals based  its  comity  analysis  on  a \n“multi-factor  balancing  test”  drawn  from  Timberlane \nLumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597, 614-615 \n(9th  Cir.  1976),  and  Mannington  Mills,  595  F.2d  at \n1297-1298.    Pet.  App.  14a-15a.    The  court  focused  pri-\nmarily on the first factor, which asks whether there was \na “true conflict” between U.S. and Chinese law—that is, \nwhether  “Chinese  law  required  [respondents]  to  enter \ninto horizontal price-fixing agreements.”  Id. at 19a. \n\nThe court of appeals stated that the answer to that \nquestion “hinge[d] on the amount of deference” owed to \nthe  Ministry’s  characterization  of  Chinese  law.    Pet. \n\n1   Respondents’  co-defendants  settled  before  or  during  the  trial.  \n\nPet. App. 39a n.1. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f8 \n\nApp.  20a.    The  court  acknowledged  that  some  courts \nhave declined to “accept such statements as conclusive.”  \nId. at 20a-21a.  But the court disagreed with those deci-\nsions, holding instead that when a foreign sovereign “di-\nrectly participates in U.S. court proceedings by provid-\ning a sworn evidentiary proffer regarding the construc-\ntion and effect of its laws and regulations, which is rea-\nsonable under the circumstances presented, a U.S. court \nis bound to defer.”  Id. at 25a.   \n\nThe court of appeals then held, based on the Minis-\ntry’s amicus brief, that “Chinese law required [respond-\nents]  to  engage  in  activities  in  China  that  constituted \nantitrust  violations  here  in  the  United  States.”    Pet. \nApp. 27a.  In reaching that conclusion, the court gener-\nally limited its inquiry to the analysis in the Ministry’s \nbrief.  It did not consider the apparently contradictory \nstatements  and  authorities  on  which  the  district  court \nhad  relied,  and  it  did  not  address  the  district  court’s \ncriticisms of the Ministry’s submissions.  Id. at 27a-33a. \nHaving  found  a  true  conflict,  the  court  of  appeals \nstated that the remaining comity factors “clearly weigh \nin favor of U.S. courts abstaining from asserting juris-\ndiction.”  Pet. App. 33a.  The court noted, for example, \nthat respondents are Chinese companies, that their con-\nduct had occurred in China, and that (according to the \nMinistry) this suit had “negatively affected U.S.-China \nrelations.”  Id. at 34a-35a. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nWhen a federal court deciding a question of foreign \nlaw under Rule 44.1 is presented with the views of the \nrelevant foreign government, it should ordinarily afford \nthose views substantial weight.  But the ultimate respon-\nsibility for determining the governing law lies with the \n\n \n\f9 \n\ncourt, which is neither bound to adopt the foreign gov-\nernment’s characterization nor barred from considering \nother materials that support a different interpretation. \nA.  Until 1966, federal courts followed the common-\nlaw rule that foreign law must be pleaded and proved as \na fact.  Rule 44.1 abandoned that cumbersome approach \nand sought to align the process of determining foreign \nlaw  more  closely  with  the  process  of  determining  do-\nmestic law.  The rule specifies that issues of foreign law \nmust be decided as questions of law, and it grants courts \nbroad latitude to determine foreign law based on “any \nrelevant material or source.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1. \n\nB.  Federal  courts  determining  foreign  law  are \nsometimes presented with the views of the relevant for-\neign government.  Those views always warrant respect-\nful consideration, and they will ordinarily be entitled to \nsubstantial  weight.    But  courts  have  correctly  recog-\nnized  that  the  appropriate  weight  depends  on  the  cir-\ncumstances.    Given  the  diversity  of  foreign  legal  sys-\ntems and the wide range of ways in which foreign gov-\nernments present their views to U.S. courts, those cir-\ncumstances cannot be reduced to a formula or rule.  The \nrelevant  considerations  include  the  interpretation’s \nclarity, thoroughness, and support; its context and pur-\npose; the nature and transparency of the foreign legal \nsystem;  the  role  and  authority  of  the  entity  or  official \noffering the interpretation; its consistency with the for-\neign government’s past positions; and any other corrob-\norating or contradictory materials. \n\nC.  The  court  of  appeals  held  that,  when  a  foreign \ngovernment  “directly  participates  in  U.S.  court  pro-\nceedings” and offers an interpretation that is “reasona-\nble under the circumstances,” “a U.S. court is bound to \ndefer.”   Pet.  App.  25a.   In  applying  that standard,  the \n\n \n\f10 \n\ncourt limited its inquiry to the analysis in the Ministry’s \nbrief.    Id.  at  27a-29a.    The  court  thus  effectively  held \nthat a federal court is bound to adopt a foreign govern-\nment’s submission characterizing its own law so long as \nit is facially reasonable.  That rigid rule is unsound. \n\n1.  The court of appeals’ approach departs from the \npolicies embodied in Rule 44.1.  A rule that does not per-\nmit a court even to consider relevant information cast-\ning  doubt  on  a  foreign  government’s  submission  is  in-\nconsistent with federal courts’ responsibility to “deter-\nmin[e] foreign law” based on “any relevant material or \nsource.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1.  And a rule that a federal \ncourt must accept any facially reasonable litigating po-\nsition  a foreign government  may  assert  concerning its \nown laws is inconsistent with Rule 44.1’s direction that \ncourts are free to look beyond the parties’ submissions \nto reach accurate conclusions about the meaning of for-\neign law. \n\n2.  The  court  of  appeals’  approach  is  also  incon-\nsistent with federal courts’ treatment of submissions by \nU.S.  States  characterizing  their  laws.    This  Court  has \nheld  that  such  submissions  are  entitled  to  significant \nbut not controlling weight.  Nothing in the text, history, \nor  purposes  of  Rule  44.1  suggests  that  a  federal  court \nmust give greater weight to a submission from a foreign \nsovereign than it would give to a similar submission from \na domestic one. \n\n3.  The  court  of  appeals  believed  that  its  rigid  ap-\nproach  was  compelled  by  United  States  v.  Pink,  315 \nU.S. 203 (1942).  In that case, which predated Rule 44.1, \nthis  Court  stated  that  an  “official  declaration  by  the \nCommissariat of Justice” of the Russian Socialist Fed-\neral  Soviet  Republic  was  “conclusive”  evidence  of  the \nextraterritorial  reach  of  a  Russian  decree.   Id.  at  218, \n\n \n \n\f11 \n\n220.  But that statement was premised on a finding that \nthe  Commissariat  “ha[d]  power  to  interpret  existing \nRussian law,” id. at 220, and there was no indication that \nthe declaration—which had been obtained by the United \nStates  through  diplomatic  channels—was  subject  to \nquestion.    The  Court’s  statement  that  the  declaration \nwas  “conclusive”  under  those  unusual  circumstances \ndoes  not  suggest  that  every  submission  by  a  foreign \ngovernment is entitled to the same weight. \n\n4.  The court of appeals also reasoned that a foreign \ngovernment should be afforded “the same respect and \ntreatment that we would expect our government to re-\nceive in comparable matters.”  Pet. App. 26a.  But the \nUnited  States  has  not  argued  that  foreign  courts  are \nbound to accept its characterizations of U.S. law or pre-\ncluded from considering other relevant material, and we \nare not aware of any foreign-court decision holding that \nrepresentations  by  the  United  States  are  entitled  to \nsuch conclusive weight. \n\nD.  Because the court of appeals concluded that the \ndistrict court was bound to defer to the Ministry’s ami-\ncus brief, it did not review “the district court’s careful \nand  thorough  treatment”  of  the  materials  bearing  on \nthe  meaning  of  Chinese  law.    Pet.  App.  30a  n.10.    The \nquestion  whether  the  district  court  correctly  inter-\npreted Chinese law is not before this Court, and we do \nnot take a position on it.  But the materials the district \ncourt identified were, at minimum, relevant to the ques-\ntion  whether  Chinese  law  required  respondents’  con-\nduct.    The  Court  should  therefore  vacate  the  decision \nbelow and remand to allow the court of appeals to con-\nsider that question under the correct standard. \n\n \n\f12 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nA FEDERAL COURT DETERMINING FOREIGN LAW IS NOT \nBOUND  BY  THE  VIEWS  EXPRESSED  IN  A  SUBMISSION \nFROM THE RELEVANT FOREIGN GOVERNMENT  \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 provides that a \nfederal  district  court  faced  with  a  question  of  foreign \nlaw should resolve it as a matter of law and may base its \ndetermination on “any relevant material or source.”  A \nsubmission expressing the views of the foreign govern-\nment is highly relevant, and courts should ordinarily af-\nford such submissions substantial  weight.  As in  other \ncontexts, however, the ultimate responsibility for deter-\nmining the governing law lies with the court.  The court \nis neither bound to adopt the characterization urged by \nthe  foreign  government  nor  barred  from  considering \nmaterials that support a different interpretation. \n\nA.  Rule  44.1  Grants  Federal  Courts  Broad  Latitude  \nTo  Decide  Questions  Of  Foreign  Law  Based  On  Any  \nRelevant Material Or Source \n\n1.  Federal courts encounter questions of foreign law \nin many different contexts.  In some cases, choice-of-law \nprinciples point to foreign law as the rule of decision for \nthe  parties’  dispute.    See,  e.g.,  Day  &  Zimmermann, \nInc. v. Challoner, 423 U.S. 3, 3-4 (1975) (per curiam).  In \nothers, foreign law controls or bears upon a specific is-\nsue in a case that is otherwise governed by U.S. law: \n\n•  As this case illustrates, foreign law may in some \ncircumstances prevent the imposition of liability \nunder the U.S. antitrust laws.  See p. 3, supra. \n\n•  The  Lacey  Act  Amendments  of  1981,  16  U.S.C. \n3372(a)(2)(A), impose civil and criminal penalties \nfor the importation of “fish or wildlife taken, pos-\nsessed, transported, or sold in violation of  * * *  \n\n \n\f13 \n\nany  foreign  law.”    See,  e.g.,  United  States  v. \nMitchell,  985  F.2d  1275,  1279-1280  (4th  Cir. \n1993). \n\n•  A mail- or wire-fraud prosecution may be based on \na scheme to defraud involving foreign property, \nwhich may require “a court to recognize foreign \nlaw to determine whether the defendant violated \nU.S.  law.”    Pasquantino  v.  United  States,  544 \nU.S. 349, 369 (2005). \n\n•  The application of the federal tax laws sometimes \nturns on “foreign law.”  Guardian Indus. Corp. \nv. United States, 477 F.3d 1368, 1371 (Fed. Cir. \n2007)  (citation  omitted)  (credits  for  payment  of \nforeign taxes).  \n\n•  A contract governed by foreign law may provide \na  defense  to  a  claim  under  federal  intellectual-\nproperty  law.    See,  e.g.,  Bodum  USA,  Inc.  v.  \nLa Cafetiere, Inc., 621 F.3d 624, 625-628 (7th Cir. \n2010). \n\n•  A foreign law prohibiting disclosure may in some \ncircumstances  excuse  or  affect  the  remedy  for \nnoncompliance  with  an  order  requiring  the  pro-\nduction of documents located abroad.  See Société \nNationale  Industrielle  Aérospatiale  v.  United \nStates Dist.  Court,  482 U.S.  522, 544-546 &  n.29 \n(1987) (Aérospatiale). \n\n•  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 4(f ), which gov-\nerns  service  of  process  in  a  foreign  country,  in-\ncorporates “the foreign country’s law for service \nin that country.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. 4(f )(2)(A); see, \ne.g., Prewitt Enters., Inc. v. Organization of Pe-\ntroleum Exporting Countries, 353 F.3d 916, 923-\n\n \n\f14 \n\n924 & n.11 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 543 U.S. \n814 (2004). \n\n2.  English  and  American  common  law  treated  for-\neign law “as a question of fact to be pleaded and proved \nas a fact by the party whose cause of action or defense \ndepend[ed] upon alien law.”  Arthur R. Miller, Federal \nRule  44.1  and  the  “Fact”  Approach  to  Determining \nForeign  Law:    Death  Knell  for  a  Die-Hard  Doctrine,  \n65 Mich. L. Rev. 613, 617 (1967) (Miller).  In 1801, this \nCourt endorsed  the common-law rule, instructing that \n“the laws of a foreign nation” must be “proved as facts.”  \nTalbot v. Seeman, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 1, 37-38 (1801); see, \ne.g., Church v. Hubbart, 6 U.S. (2 Cranch) 187, 236-237 \n(1804) (“Foreign laws are well understood to be facts.”). \nTreating questions of foreign law as questions of fact \n“had a number of undesirable practical consequences.”  \n9A  Charles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal \nPractice  and  Procedure  §  2441,  at  324  (3d  ed.  2008) \n(Wright & Miller).  Foreign law “had to be raised in the \npleadings” and proved “in accordance with the rules of \nevidence.”  Ibid.  Courts were restricted to the evidence \nsubmitted  by  the  parties.    Ibid.    And  appellate  review \nwas  deferential  and  limited  to  the  record  made  in  the \ntrial court.  Ibid. \n\nAfter the adoption of the Federal Rules of Civil Pro-\ncedure  in  1938,  some  federal  courts  began  to  invoke \nstate  procedures  that  departed  from  the  common-law \napproach by allowing courts to take judicial notice of for-\neign law.  Miller 654-656; see Fed. R. Civ. P. 43(a) (1964) \n(incorporating state evidentiary rules).  But those state \nprocedures varied, and some were “time consuming and \nexpensive.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1  advisory  committee’s \nnote  (1966)  (Adoption)  (Advisory  Committee’s  Note).  \n\n \n\f15 \n\nThe  process  of  determining  foreign  law  thus  remained \n“cumbersome.”  Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 370.  \n\n3.  In 1966, this Court promulgated Rule 44.1 to “fur-\nnish Federal courts with a uniform and effective proce-\ndure  for  raising  and  determining  an  issue  concerning \nthe  law  of  a  foreign  country.”    Advisory  Committee’s \nNote.    The  rule  accomplishes  that  goal  by  providing \nthat, “[i]n determining foreign law, the court may  con-\nsider  any  relevant  material  or  source,  including  testi-\nmony, whether or not submitted by a party or admissible \nunder the Federal Rules of Evidence.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n44.1.  The rule also specifies that the court’s determina-\ntion “must be treated as a ruling on a question of law,” \nrather than as a finding of fact.  Ibid.2   \n\nRule 44.1 “improves on [the procedures] available at \ncommon law.”  Pasquantino, 544 U.S. at 370.  By allow-\ning courts to rely on any relevant material, regardless \nof  its  admissibility  under  the  Federal  Rules  of  Evi-\ndence,  the  rule  “provides  flexible  procedures  for  pre-\nsenting and utilizing material on issues of foreign law.”  \nAdvisory  Committee’s  Note.    By  specifying  that  the \ncourt’s determination is a conclusion of law, the rule en-\nsures de novo appellate review.  Ibid.  And by providing \nthat courts are not limited to materials submitted by the \nparties,  the  rule  recognizes  that  courts  “may  wish  to \nreexamine  and  amplify  material  that  has  been  pre-\nsented by counsel in partisan fashion or in insufficient \ndetail.”  Ibid.  The “obvious” purpose of those changes \nwas “to make the process of determining alien law iden-\ntical with the method of ascertaining domestic law to the \n\n2   Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 26.1 establishes “substan-\ntially the same” rule for criminal cases.  Fed. R. Crim. P. 26.1 advi-\nsory committee’s note (1966) (Adoption).  Given that similarity, this \nbrief relies on decisions applying both rules.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f16 \n\nextent that it is possible to do so.”  9A Wright & Miller \n§ 2444, at 338-342.  \n\nCourts deciding questions of foreign law under Rule \n44.1 rely on a variety of materials, including “[s]tatutes, \nadministrative  materials,  and  judicial  decisions”;  “sec-\nondary sources such as texts and learned journals”; “ex-\npert testimony”; and “any other information” that may \nbe  probative.    9A  Wright  &  Miller  §  2444,  at  342-343  \n(3d ed. 2008 & Supp. 2017).  In evaluating those materi-\nals, a court “is free  * * *  to give them whatever proba-\ntive  value  [it]  thinks  they  deserve.”    Id.  at  343.    The \nguiding principle is that courts  “should use the best of \nthe available sources” to reach an accurate interpreta-\ntion of foreign law.  Bodum USA, 621 F.3d at 628. \n\nB.  A  Foreign  Government’s  Characterization  Of  Its  Own \nLaw Is Ordinarily Entitled To Substantial Weight, But \nIs Not Binding On Federal Courts \n\nFederal courts deciding questions of foreign law un-\nder Rule 44.1 are sometimes presented with the views \nof the relevant foreign government.  Those views always \nwarrant respectful consideration, and they will ordinar-\nily be entitled to substantial weight.  But the appropri-\nate  weight  in  each  case  will  depend  on  the  circum-\nstances,  and  a  federal  court  is  neither  bound  to  adopt \nthe foreign government’s characterization nor required \nto ignore other relevant materials.   \n\n1.  Federal  courts  considering  questions  of  foreign \nlaw may be presented with the views of the relevant for-\neign government through a variety of formal and infor-\nmal mechanisms.  Often, the foreign state (or one of its \nagencies or instrumentalities) is itself a party to the lit-\nigation.  See, e.g., Northrop Grumman Ship Sys., Inc. \nv.  Ministry  of  Def.  of  the  Republic  of  Venezuela,  575 \nF.3d  491,  496-498  &  n.8  (5th  Cir.  2009);  McKesson \n\n \n\f17 \n\nHBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F.3d 1101, \n1108-1109  (D.C.  Cir.  2001)  (McKesson),  cert.  denied, \n537  U.S.  941  (2002),  vacated in part  on  other grounds, \n320  F.3d  280  (D.C.  Cir.  2003);  In  re  Oil  Spill  by  the \nAmoco Cadiz, 954 F.2d 1279, 1289, 1312 (7th Cir. 1992) \n(Amoco Cadiz). \n\nAs  this  case  illustrates,  foreign  governments  (and \ntheir  agencies  and  officials)  may  also  express  their \nviews  through  amicus  briefs  or  similar  submissions  in \ncases where no foreign governmental entity is a party.  \nPet. App. 189a-223a; see, e.g., United States v. McNab, \n331 F.3d 1228, 1239-1240 & n.23 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. \ndenied, 540 U.S. 1177 (2004).  Alternatively, a party may \nsubmit an affidavit or testimony from a foreign official.  \nSee, e.g., United States v. Schultz, 333 F.3d 393, 400-401 \n(2d Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. 1106 (2004); United \nStates  v.  2,507  Live  Canary  Winged  Parakeets,  689  \nF.  Supp.  1106,  1109-1110  (S.D.  Fla.  1988).    Or  a  party \nmay rely on an interpretation that the relevant foreign \nsovereign  has  issued  outside  the  context  of  the  litiga-\ntion.    See,  e.g.,  Abbott  v.  Abbott,  560  U.S.  1,  10  (2010) \n(letter from a Chilean agency); Access Telecom, Inc. v. \nMCI  Telecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d  694,  714  (5th  Cir. \n1999)  (circular  issued  by  a  Mexican  agency),  cert.  de-\nnied, 531 U.S. 917 (2000). \n\n2.  Neither  Rule  44.1  nor  any  other  rule  or  statute \nspecifically  addresses  the  weight  that  a  federal  court \ndetermining foreign law should give to the views of the \nforeign government.  As a general matter, courts in de-\nciding such questions should be guided by principles of \ninternational comity, “the spirit of cooperation in which \na domestic tribunal approaches the resolution of cases \ntouching  the  laws  and  interests  of  other  sovereign \nstates.”    Aérospatiale,  482  U.S.  at  543  n.27.    In  other \n\n \n\f18 \n\ncontexts, this Court has “long recognized the demands \nof comity in suits involving foreign states, either as par-\nties  or  as  sovereigns  with  a  coordinate  interest  in  the \nlitigation.”  Id. at 546.  To afford appropriate respect for \n“[t]he  dignity  of  a  foreign  state,”  Republic  of  Philip-\npines  v.  Pimentel,  553  U.S.  851,  866  (2008),  a  federal \ncourt  should  carefully  consider  that  state’s  proffered \nviews about the meaning of its own laws.   \n\nGranting substantial weight to the views of the rele-\nvant  foreign  government  is  also  eminently  sensible.  \n“Among the most logical sources for [a] court to look to \nin its determination of foreign law are the foreign offi-\ncials charged with enforcing the laws of their country,” \nwho  are  intimately  familiar  with  the  context  and  nu-\nances of the foreign legal system.  McNab, 331 F.3d at \n1241;  cf.  Bodum  USA,  621  F.3d  at  638-639  (Wood,  J., \nconcurring) (noting the risk that an unaided U.S. reader \nmay  “miss  nuances  in  the  foreign  law”).    Ordinarily,  a \ncourt therefore “reasonably may assume” that interpre-\ntations offered by the relevant foreign agencies or offi-\ncials “are a reliable and accurate source” of the meaning \nof foreign law.  McNab, 331 F.3d at 1241. \n\n3.  The federal courts have generally adhered to the \nforegoing principles.  Courts have recognized that “a for-\neign  sovereign’s  views  regarding  its  own  laws  merit—\nalthough they do not command—some degree of defer-\nence.”  Karaha Bodas Co. v. Perusahaan Pertambangan \nMinyak Dan Gas Bumi Negara, 313 F.3d 70, 92 (2d Cir. \n2002), cert. denied, 539 U.S. 904 (2003); see, e.g., Access \nTelecom,  197  F.3d  at  714  (“[C]ourts  may  defer  to  for-\neign  government  interpretations.”); Amoco  Cadiz,  954 \nF.2d  at  1312  (“A  court  of  the  United  States  owes sub-\nstantial deference to the construction France places on \nits domestic law.”).  In Abbott, for example, this Court \n\n \n\f19 \n\nstated that the views of a Chilean agency were “notable” \nand  “support[ed]  the  [Court’s]  conclusion”  about  the \nmeaning of Chilean law.  560 U.S. at 10. \n\nCourts have not, however, treated a foreign govern-\nment’s  characterization  of  its  own  law  as binding.    In-\nstead,  they  have  recognized  that  the  weight  given  to \nsuch  a  characterization  should  depend  on  the  circum-\nstances.    For  example,  when  “a  foreign  government \nchanges its  original position” or  otherwise makes  con-\nflicting  statements,  a  court  is  not  bound  to  accept  its \nmost recent statement, or the one offered in litigation.  \nMcNab, 331 F.3d at 1241; see, e.g., Export-Import Bank \nof  the  Republic  of  China  v.  Central  Bank  of  Liberia,  \nNo. 15-cv-9565, 2017 WL 1378271, at *4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. \n12, 2017).  A court likewise may decline to adopt an in-\nterpretation if it is unclear or unsupported, if it fails to \naddress  relevant  authorities,  or  if  it  is  implausible  in \nlight of other relevant materials.  See, e.g., Themis Cap-\nital,  LLC  v.  Democratic  Republic  of  Congo,  626  Fed. \nAppx.  346,  348  (2d  Cir.  2015);  McKesson,  271  F.3d  at \n1108-1109. \n\n4.  In describing the weight that should be given to a \nforeign  government’s  views  about  its  own  law,  parties \nand  lower  courts  have  sometimes  borrowed  domestic \nadministrative-law standards.  See, e.g., Resp. Supp. Br. \n2-3; Amoco Cadiz, 954 F.2d at 1312.  In our view, such \nanalogies are generally unhelpful because those stand-\nards are grounded in domestic considerations.  For ex-\nample,  courts  defer  to  reasonable  agency  interpreta-\ntions  under  Chevron  U.S.A.  Inc.  v.  NRDC,  Inc.,  467 \nU.S.  837  (1984),  in  specific  circumstances,  including \nwhen Congress has “delegated authority to the agency \ngenerally to make rules carrying the force of law” and \n“the  agency  interpretation  claiming  deference  was \n\n \n\f20 \n\npromulgated in the exercise of that authority.”  United \nStates v. Mead Corp., 533 U.S. 218, 226-227 (2001).  The \nstandard  articulated  in  Skidmore  v.  Swift  &  Co.,  \n323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944), is more flexible, but it too has  \ndomestic-law  roots  and  a  specific  meaning  acquired \nthrough  repeated  domestic  applications.    See  Mead,  \n533 U.S. at 234-235. \n\nThose  administrative-law  doctrines  do  not  readily \ntranslate to the Rule 44.1 context.  “[T]he world’s many \ndiverse legal and governmental systems” differ greatly \nfrom ours and from each other.  McNab, 331 F.3d at 1237 \n(citation  omitted).    The  views  of  foreign  governments \nabout those varying systems are presented to the federal \ncourts  under  a  wide  range  of  different  circumstances.  \nAnd the submissions themselves differ greatly in their \nformality, thoroughness, and authority.  See pp. 16-17, \nsupra.  Deference standards that were crafted for spe-\ncific areas of federal administrative law and that carry \ndecades of accumulated domestic-law meanings are ill-\nsuited for this very different context. \n\n5.  Rather  than  transplanting  a  standard  from  do-\nmestic  administrative  law,  a  federal  court  confronted \nwith a disputed question of foreign law should proceed \nin the same manner as a court facing any other unset-\ntled  legal question:   By  seeking  to  resolve it  “with  the \naid of such light as is afforded by the materials for de-\ncision at hand.”  Salve Regina Coll. v. Russell, 499 U.S. \n225, 227 (1991) (brackets and citation omitted).  As this \nCourt emphasized in addressing the analogous problem \nof  determining  the  law  of  former  Mexican  territories \nbefore their annexation into the United States, “it has \nalways been held that it is for the court to decide what \nweight is to be given” to the legal materials available in \n\n \n\f21 \n\na  particular  case.    Fremont  v.  United  States,  58  U.S.  \n(17 How.) 542, 557 (1855). \n\nWhen  those  materials  include  an  interpretation  by \nthe  relevant  foreign  government,  that  interpretation \nshould be afforded respectful consideration and will or-\ndinarily be entitled to substantial weight.  The precise \nweight that is appropriate in a particular case will nec-\nessarily  depend  on  the  circumstances.    Those  circum-\nstances  are  too  diverse  to  be  reduced  to  a  formula  or \nrule, but the relevant considerations include the inter-\npretation’s clarity, thoroughness, and support; its con-\ntext  and  purpose;  the  nature  and  transparency  of  the \nforeign legal system; the role and authority of the entity \nor  official  offering  the  interpretation;  its  consistency \nwith  the  foreign  government’s  past  positions;  and  any \nother corroborating or contradictory materials.3 \n\nC.  The Court Of Appeals Erred By Treating The Ministry’s \nAmicus  Brief  As  Binding  And  By  Disregarding  Other \nRelevant Materials \n\nThe court of appeals held that, when a foreign gov-\nernment  “directly  participates  in  U.S.  court  proceed-\nings by providing a sworn evidentiary proffer regarding \nthe construction and effect of its laws and regulations, \nwhich is reasonable under the circumstances presented, \n\n3   As  we  explained  in  our  petition-stage  brief  (at  8-9  n.1),  the \nUnited States’ amicus brief in Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. v. \nZenith  Radio  Corp.,  475  U.S.  574  (1986),  suggested  a  somewhat \nmore deferential approach.  The position we advocate here is con-\nsistent with the United States’ more recent brief in McNab, which \nendorsed  what  had  by  then  become  the  courts  of  appeals’  general \npractice  of  affording  “substantial—but  measured—deference  to  a \nforeign nation’s representations.”  U.S. Br. in Opp. at 16-17, McNab \nv. United States, 540 U.S. 1177 (2004) (No. 03-622).  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f22 \n\na U.S. court is bound to defer.”  Pet. App. 25a.  In ap-\nplying that standard and concluding that the Ministry’s \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  law  was  “reasonable,”  the \ncourt generally limited its inquiry to the four corners of \nthe  Ministry’s  brief  and  the sources  cited therein.   Id. \nat  27a-29a.    The  court  also  emphasized  that  a  federal \ncourt may not “embark on a challenge to a foreign gov-\nernment’s official representation to the court regarding \nits laws or regulations.”  Id. at 26a.  \n\nIn  practical  effect,  therefore,  the  court  of  appeals \nheld that a federal court is bound to adopt a foreign gov-\nernment’s  submission characterizing its  own  law—and \nmay  not  consider  other  relevant  material—so  long  as \nthat characterization is facially reasonable.4  That rigid \nrule  is  inconsistent  with  the  policies  underlying  Rule \n44.1 and with this Court’s treatment of analogous sub-\nmissions  from  U.S.  States.    And  the  court  of  appeals \nerred in concluding that its approach was supported by \nUnited States v. Pink, 315 U.S. 203 (1942), or by consid-\nerations of comity and reciprocity. \n\n1.  The  court  of  appeals’  rule  of  binding  deference  is  \ninconsistent with the policies embodied in Rule 44.1 \nAs the court of appeals observed, Rule 44.1 does not \nexpressly address the weight a federal court should give \nto a foreign government’s submission characterizing its \nlaws.  Pet. App. 22a.  In at least two respects, however, \nthe court’s approach departs from the policies embodied \nin that rule. \n\na.  Rule 44.1 seeks to align the treatment of foreign \nand  domestic  law  by  providing  district  courts  with \n\n4   The court of appeals left open the possibility that “deference may \nbe  inappropriate”  if  the  foreign  government’s  submission  includes \n“no documentary evidence or reference of law.”  Pet. App. 25a n.8. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f23 \n\nbroad  latitude  to  “determin[e]  foreign  law”  based  on \n“any  relevant  material  or  source.”    That  direction  re-\nflects a judgment that “whenever possible issues of for-\neign law should be resolved on their merits and on the \nbasis of a full presentation and evaluation of the availa-\nble materials.”  9A Wright & Miller § 2444, at 351. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals’  approach  is  inconsistent  with \nthat sound policy because it precludes a court from con-\nsidering  other  relevant  material  whenever  it  is  pre-\nsented with a facially reasonable submission from a for-\neign government.  Here, for example, the district court \nconcluded  that  the  Ministry’s  submissions  “fail[ed]  to \naddress  critical  provisions  of  the  [governing  legal  re-\ngime],”  Pet.  App.  119a,  and  that  they  incorrectly  im-\nplied that a superseded legal regime “was still control-\nling,” id. at 132a n.45.  The court also highlighted, inter \nalia,  China’s  statement  to  the  WTO  that  it  had \n“g[i]ve[n] up ‘export administration  . . .  of vitamin C’ ” \nat the end of 2001, id. at 74a (citation omitted), and the \nChamber’s statements that respondents had “voluntar-\nily”  agreed on  prices and  quantities  “without  any gov-\nernment  intervention,”  id.  at  173a-174a  (citation  and \nemphases omitted). \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  did  not  conclude  that  the  dis-\ntrict court’s reliance on that material was substantively \nwrong or irrelevant to the proper interpretation of Chi-\nnese law.  To the contrary, it stated that, “if the Chinese \nGovernment had not appeared in this litigation, the dis-\ntrict court’s careful and thorough treatment of the evi-\ndence    * * *    would  have  been  entirely  appropriate.”  \nPet. App. 30a n.10.  But because the Ministry had filed \na brief that the court deemed facially reasonable, it con-\ncluded that the district court had erred by considering \n\n \n\f24 \n\nadditional material and thereby “embark[ing] on a chal-\nlenge to [the Ministry’s] official representation.”  Id. at \n26a.    A  standard  that  does  not  permit  a  court  even  to \nconsider such relevant information is inconsistent with \nfederal  courts’  responsibility  to  “determin[e]  foreign \nlaw” based on “any relevant material or source.”  Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 44.1. \n\nb.  The court of appeals also departed from the poli-\ncies embodied in Rule 44.1 by placing dispositive weight \non  the  fact  that  the  Ministry  had  “directly  partici-\npate[d]”  in  the  litigation  by  offering  what  the  court \ncalled a “sworn evidentiary proffer.”  Pet. App. 25a; see \nid.  at  23a  (distinguishing  a  case  in  which  the  foreign \ngovernment “did not appear before the court”).  That is \ntrue for two reasons. \n\nFirst,  the  court  of  appeals’  characterization  of  the \nMinistry’s submission as “a sworn evidentiary proffer,” \nPet.  App.  25a,  was  inapt.    Rule  44.1  abrogated  the  \ncommon-law  rule  treating  questions  of  foreign  law  as \nquestions of fact, and it specifies that a district court’s \ndetermination  of  an  issue  of  foreign  law  “must  be \ntreated as a ruling on a question of law.”  Although the \nMinistry’s amicus brief was surely relevant to the dis-\ntrict  court’s  determination  whether  Chinese  law  re-\nquired the anticompetitive conduct at issue in this case, \nthat legal brief was neither a “sworn” document nor an \n“evidentiary proffer.”  See Pet. Br. 35-36.  By the same \ntoken,  a  court  that  considers  but  ultimately  rejects  a \nforeign  government’s  characterization  of  its  laws  does \nnot  thereby  accuse  the  foreign  government  of  misrep-\nresenting the pertinent facts.  Cf. pp. 26-27, infra (ex-\nplaining that federal courts give significant but not con-\ntrolling weight to a state attorney general’s characteri-\nzation of state law). \n\n \n\f25 \n\nSecond,  the  court  of  appeals  erred  by  holding  that \ngreater  deference  is  required  when  a  foreign  govern-\nment participates directly in  litigation.  That  fact  may \nbear on the weight a foreign government’s views should \nreceive.  It ensures, for example, that the government \nhas focused on the specific foreign-law issue that is ac-\ntually  before  the  court.    But  many  other  factors  also \nbear on the weight that should be afforded to a foreign \ngovernment’s  interpretation,  see  p. 21,  supra,  and  the \ncourt of appeals did not explain why it placed dispositive \nweight  on  this  single  consideration.    In  some  circum-\nstances, moreover, a U.S. court might justifiably view a \npronouncement  prepared  for  litigation  purposes  with \ngreater  skepticism  than  it  would  view  a  similar  pro-\nnouncement  drafted  with  no  specific  controversy  in \nmind.  Cf. Bowen v. Georgetown Univ. Hosp., 488 U.S. \n204, 213 (1988) (“Deference to what appears to be noth-\ning more than an agency’s convenient litigating position \nwould be entirely inappropriate.”). \n\nThe court of appeals’ rule, moreover, would automat-\nically  inure  to  the  benefit  of  any  foreign  government \nthat appears in U.S. court as a plaintiff or defendant in \na  case  controlled  in  whole  or  in  part  by  its  domestic \nlaws—a relatively common occurrence.5  The court iden-\ntified  no  sound  reason  why  a  federal  court  should  be \n\n5   See, e.g., Themis Capital, 626 Fed. Appx. at 348 (suit against the \nDemocratic Republic of Congo to recover debt); Karaha Bodas, 313 \nF.3d  at  75,  92  (action  to  execute  on  assets  owned  by  Indonesia); \nNorthrop  Grumman  Ship  Sys.,  575  F.3d  at  496-498  &  n.8  (suit \nagainst Venezuela for contract damages claimed to be governed in \npart by Venezuelan law); McKesson, 271 F.3d at 1103 (suit against \nIran arising out of expropriation of property); DRC, Inc. v. Republic \nof Honduras, 71 F. Supp. 3d 201, 209-210 & n.7 (D.D.C. 2014) (suit \nagainst Honduras to enforce arbitral award);  Republic of Ecuador \nv.  ChevronTexaco  Corp.,  499  F.  Supp.  2d  452,  460-461  (S.D.N.Y. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f26 \n\nbound,  in  any  suit  to  which  a  foreign  government  is  a \nparty,  by  whatever  facially  reasonable  litigating  posi-\ntion that party may assert concerning the proper under-\nstanding of its own laws.  That result would be particu-\nlarly anomalous because Rule 44.1 allows courts to look \nbeyond the “material presented by the parties” specifi-\ncally  to  ensure  that  courts  have  the  ability  to  “reex-\namine  and  amplify  material  that  has  been  presented  \nby counsel in partisan fashion or in insufficient detail.”  \nAdvisory Committee Note.  That consideration applies \nwith full force when the litigant is a foreign government. \n\n2.  The  court  of  appeals’  rule  of  binding  deference  is  \ninconsistent with this Court’s treatment of analogous \nsubmissions from U.S. States \n\nThe court of appeals’ rule of binding deference is in-\nconsistent with this Court’s approach in the other prin-\ncipal  circumstance  in  which  federal  courts  are  pre-\nsented with the views of other sovereigns on the proper \ninterpretation  of  their  laws.    When  federal  courts  re-\nceive  submissions by U.S. States addressing the proper \ninterpretation of state law, the courts give those submis-\nsions significant but not controlling weight.  Nothing in \nthe text, history, or purposes of Rule 44.1 suggests that \na  federal  court  determining  foreign  law  must  give \ngreater weight to the views of a foreign sovereign.  \n\nThis Court has long held that “[t]he law of any State \nof the Union  * * *  is a matter of which the courts of the \nUnited States are bound to take judicial notice, without \nplea  or  proof.”    Lamar  v.  Micou,  114  U.S.  218,  223 \n\n2007) (suit by Ecuador seeking to stay arbitration); Republic of Tur-\nkey v. OKS Partners, 146 F.R.D. 24, 27-28 (D. Mass. 1993) (suit by \nTurkey to recover artifacts); Government of Peru v.  Johnson, 720 \nF. Supp. 810, 812-814 (C.D. Cal. 1989) (same by Peru). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f27 \n\n(1885).  If the applicable state law is established by a de-\ncision  of  “the  State’s  highest  court,”  that  decision  is \n“binding on the federal courts.”  Wainwright v. Goode, \n464 U.S. 78, 84 (1983) (per curiam); see Mullaney v. Wil-\nbur, 421 U.S. 684, 691 (1975).  Otherwise, a federal court \nmust “consider all of the available legal sources” to pre-\ndict  “how  the  state’s  highest  court  would  answer  the \nopen questions.”  19 Wright & Miller § 4507, at 178-179 \n(3d ed. 2016); see Salve Regina Coll., 499 U.S. at 227. \n\nIn  deciding  questions  of  state  law,  the  views  of  the \nState as expressed by its attorney general are “entitled \nto weight.”  19 Wright & Miller § 4507, at 157-158; see \nArizonans for Official English v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, \n76 n.30 (1997) (citing with approval an opinion conclud-\ning  that  the  “reasoned  opinion  of  [a]  State  Attorney \nGeneral should be accorded respectful consideration”).  \nThis  Court  has  made  clear,  however,  that  those  views \nare  not  entitled  to  “controlling  weight.”    Stenberg  v. \nCarhart, 530 U.S. 914, 940 (2000); see, e.g., Virginia v. \nAmerican Booksellers Ass’n., 484 U.S. 383, 395 (1988).  \nThe court of appeals gave no sound reason for requiring \nthat federal courts give greater weight to the views of \nforeign governments. \n\n3.  This  Court’s  decision  in  Pink  does  not  support  the \n\ncourt of appeals’ rule of binding deference \n\nThe court of appeals believed that its rigid approach \nwas compelled by this Court’s pre-Rule 44.1 decision in \nPink.  Pet. App. 20a, 22a-23a.  That is not correct.  Pink \narose out of an action brought by the United States to \nrecover assets of the U.S. branch of a Russian insurance \ncompany  that  had  been  nationalized  in  1918  after  the \nRussian revolution.  315 U.S. at 210.  In 1933, the gov-\nernment of the Soviet Union assigned the nationalized \nassets to the United States.  Id. at 211.  The disposition \n\n \n\f28 \n\nof  the  case  turned  on  the  extraterritorial  effect  of  the \nnationalization  decree—specifically,  whether  the  de-\ncree  had  reached  the  assets  of  the  Russian  insurance \ncompany  located  in  the  United  States,  or  instead  had \nbeen limited to property in Russia.  Id. at 213-215, 217. \nTo  support  its  position  that  the  nationalization  de-\ncree had reached all of the company’s assets, the United \nStates obtained an “official declaration by the Commis-\nsariat for Justice” of the Russian Socialist Federal So-\nviet Republic.  Pink, 315 U.S. at 218.   The declaration \ncertified  that  the  decree  had  reached  “the  funds  and \nproperty of former insurance companies  * * *  irrespec-\ntive of whether it was situated within the territorial lim-\nits of [Russia] or abroad.”  Id. at 220 (citation omitted).  \nThis  Court  held that  “the evidence  supported  [a]  find-\ning” that “the Commissariat for Justice ha[d] power to \ninterpret  existing  Russian  law.”    Ibid.    “That  being \ntrue,” the Court concluded that the “official declaration \n[wa]s conclusive so far as the intended extraterritorial \neffect of the Russian decree [wa]s concerned.”  Ibid. \n\nThis Court’s treatment of the declaration as conclu-\nsive was thus premised on an independent finding about \nthe  Commissariat’s  authority  within  the  Soviet  legal \nsystem.  Pink, 315 U.S. at 220.  The declaration was also \nobtained  by  the  United  States,  through  official  “diplo-\nmatic channels.”  Id. at 218.  The Commissariat’s decla-\nration was thus in some respects akin to a state supreme \ncourt’s  answer  to  a  question  of  state  law  certified  by  \na  federal  court.    Cf.  Arizonans  for  Official  English,  \n520 U.S. at 76-77.  There was apparently no indication \nthat the declaration was incomplete or inconsistent with \nthe Soviet Union’s past statements, and the Court em-\nphasized that the declaration was consistent with expert \nevidence  that  “gave  great  credence  to  [the]  position” \n\n \n\f29 \n\nthat  the  nationalization  decree  reached  property  lo-\ncated abroad.  Pink, 315 U.S. at 218.  The Court’s state-\nment that the Commissariat’s declaration was “conclu-\nsive” under those unusual circumstances does not sug-\ngest that every submission by a foreign government is \nentitled to the same weight. \n\n4.  Considerations  of  reciprocity  and  comity  do  not  \nsupport the court of appeals’ rule of binding deference \nThe  court  of  appeals  also  reasoned  that  a  foreign \ngovernment’s characterization of its own laws should be \nafforded  “the  same  respect  and  treatment  that  we \nwould expect our government to receive in comparable \nmatters.”  Pet. App. 26a.  That concern for reciprocity \nwas sound, but it does not support the court’s approach.  \nIn fact, the opposite is true. \n\nWhen  the  United  States  litigates  questions  of  U.S. \nlaw  in  foreign  tribunals, it expects  that the views sub-\nmitted on its behalf will be afforded substantial weight, \nand  that  its  characterizations  of  U.S.  law  will  be  ac-\ncepted  because  they  are  accurate  and  well-supported.  \nBut the United States historically has not argued that \nforeign courts are bound to accept its characterizations \nor precluded from considering other relevant material. 6  \nAnd although other nations’ approaches to determining \nforeign law vary, we are not aware of any foreign-court \ndecision  holding  that  representations  by  the  United \nStates are entitled to such conclusive weight.  \n\n6   Respondents  assert  (Supp.  Br.  7-8)  that  the  United  States \nsought a greater degree of deference in a 2002 submission to a WTO \npanel.  In fact, that submission acknowledged that “the Panel is not \nbound  to  accept  the  interpretation  [of  U.S.  law]  presented  by  the \nUnited States.”  Second Written Submission of the United States of \nAmerica, United States—Section 129(c)(1) of the Uruguay Round \nAgreements Act, WT/DS221 ¶ 11 (Mar. 8, 2002). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f30 \n\nThe  understanding  that  a  government’s  expressed \nview of its own law is ordinarily entitled to substantial \nbut not conclusive weight is also consistent with two in-\nternational  treaties  that  establish  formal  mechanisms \nby which one government may obtain from another an \nofficial  statement  characterizing  its  laws.    Those  trea-\nties specify that “[t]he information given in reply shall \nnot bind  the  judicial  authority  from  which  the  request \nemanated.”    European  Convention  on  Information  on \nForeign Law art. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 147, 154; \nsee  Organization  of  American  States,  Inter-American \nConvention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on  Foreign \nLaw  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  O.A.S.T.S.  No.  53,  1439 \nU.N.T.S. 107, 111 (similar).  Although the United States \nis not a party to those treaties, they reflect an interna-\ntional practice that is inconsistent with the court of ap-\npeals’ approach, and they confirm that the court’s rule \nof binding deference is not supported by considerations \nof international comity.  \n\nD.  This  Court  Should  Vacate  The  Decision  Below  And  \nRemand  The  Case  To  Allow  The  Court  Of  Appeals  To \nApply The Correct Legal Standard \n\nBecause the court of appeals concluded that the dis-\ntrict court was bound to defer to the Ministry’s amicus \nbrief, the court did not consider the shortcomings that \nthe  district  court  had  identified  in  the  Ministry’s  sub-\nmissions  or  the  other  aspects  of  “the  district  court’s \ncareful and thorough treatment of the evidence before \nit.”  Pet. App. 30a n.10.  The question whether the dis-\n\n \n\f31 \n\ntrict court correctly interpreted Chinese law is not be-\nfore this Court, and we do not take a position on it. 7  But \nthe  materials  identified  by  the  district  court  were,  at \nminimum,  relevant  to  the  weight  that  the  Ministry’s \nsubmissions should receive and to the question whether \nChinese law required respondents’ conduct.  This Court \nshould therefore vacate the decision below and remand  \n\n7   Respondents  are  wrong  in  stating  (Supp.  Br.  6-7)  that  the \nUnited States “affirmed” their interpretation of Chinese law in pro-\nceedings before the WTO.  Those proceedings involved a different \nrecord  and  other  commodities,  not  vitamin  C.    See  First  Written \nSubmission  of  the  United  States  of  America,  China—Measures  \nRelated  to  the  Exportation  of  Various  Raw  Materials,  DS394, \nDS395, DS398 ¶ 4 (June 1, 2010).  Based on China’s representations \nto the district court in this case—which were against China’s inter-\nest in the WTO proceeding—the United States argued that export \nrestraints  adopted  by  a  different  China  Chamber  of  Commerce \nwere  “attributable  to  China”  for  purposes  of  China’s  compliance \nwith  its  WTO  obligations.    Id.  ¶  208.    But  in  addition  to  involving \ndifferent commodities and a different record, the WTO proceeding \nwas governed by a different legal standard.  This litigation has fo-\ncused on the question whether Chinese law required respondents to \nfix the prices and output of vitamin C exports.  In contrast, as the \nWTO panel explained, “[p]rivate actions” have been “found to be ‘at-\ntributable’ to a government, and thus subject to challenge [in WTO \nproceedings],  where  there  is  ‘some  governmental  connection  to  \nor  endorsement  of  those  actions.’ ”    World  Trade  Organization, \nChina—Measures Related to the Exportation of Various Raw Ma-\nterials:  Reports of the Panel, WT/DS394/R, WT/DS395/R, WT/DS398/R \n¶ 7.1004 (July 5, 2011) (citation omitted).  That standard may be sat-\nisfied even where a nation’s law does not require the relevant pri-\nvate conduct. \n\n \n \n \n                                                      \n\f32 \n\nto  allow  the  court  of  appeals  to  consider  that  question \nunder the correct legal standard.8 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe  judgment  of  the  court  of  appeals  should  be  \nvacated,  and  the  case  should  be  remanded  for  further \nproceedings consistent with this Court’s opinion. \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\n  NOEL J.

As  we \nexplained at the petition stage  (Br.  20), the court’s comity analysis \nwas erroneous in other respects as well.  For example, the court gave \ninadequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims of the alleged \nprice-fixing  cartel  and  to  the  interests  of  the  United  States  in  en-\nforcement of its laws.  Pet. App. 34a-35a.  Conversely, the court gave \ntoo much weight to China’s objections to this suit.  Id. at 35a.  Unlike \na  statement  from  the  Executive  Branch  of  the  U.S.  government,  a \nforeign sovereign’s objection to a suit does not, in itself, necessarily \nindicate that the case will harm U.S. foreign relations. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f"
