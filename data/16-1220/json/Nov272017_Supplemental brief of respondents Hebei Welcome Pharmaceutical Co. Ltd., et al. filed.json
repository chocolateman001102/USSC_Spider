        "1 \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nThe  Second  Circuit  unanimously  adopted  the \nrule  in  this  case  that  “when  a  foreign  government, \nacting \nthrough  counsel  or  otherwise,  directly \nparticipates  in  U.S.  court  proceedings  by  providing  a \nsworn  evidentiary  proffer  regarding  the  construction \nand  effect  of  its  laws  and  regulations,  which  is \nreasonable under the circumstances presented, a U.S. \ncourt is bound to defer to those statements.” Pet. App. \nthis \n25a.  The  United  States \narticulation  of  the  standard  of  deference  to  a  foreign \ngovernment’s  statement  of  its  own  law  is  “not \nnecessarily  [  ]  problematic[.]”  Br.  of  U.S.  at  9.  But  it \nnevertheless  recommends  that  this  Court  review  the \ndecision  below  because  it  quibbles  with  how  the \nSecond  Circuit  applied  that  standard.  Id.  at  9-13. \nSuch  a  dispute  over  the  application  of  a  properly \nstated legal standard to the facts of this case does not \ncreate an issue worthy of this Court’s review, and the \npetition  for  certiorari should  therefore be denied,  the \nUnited States’ recommendation notwithstanding.1 \n\nconcedes \n\nthat \n\n1 Respondents  agree  with  the  United  States  that  the \nfirst and third questions presented by the Petition do \nnot  merit  review,  and  therefore  do  not  address  the \nUnited States’ arguments on those points. Br. of U.S. \nat 13-22.",
        "2 \n\nI. \n\nTHE UNITED STATES OVERSTATES \nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S NARROW \nHOLDING AND IGNORES THE SECOND \nCIRCUIT’S EXPLANATION FOR WHY \nEVIDENCE OUTSIDE OF THE CHINESE \nSTATUTES AND REGULATIONS AT \nISSUE AND THE MINISTRY’S \nEXPLANATION OF THEM WOULD NOT \nAID IN CONSTRUING THEM \n\nin \n\nthat \n\nformally  appear \n\n1.  The  Second  Circuit’s  holding  quoted  above \nprovides  for  deference  to  the  statement  of  a  foreign \ngovernment regarding the construction of its own law \nsolely  under  the  following  conditions:  1)  that  the \nforeign  government \nthe \nproceedings, 2) that the foreign government provide a \nsworn  evidentiary  proffer,  and  3) \nthe \nconstruction given to the foreign government’s law be \nreasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Pet.  App.  25a. \nThis  standard  does not  require  absolute  deference  to \nforeign  sovereigns  in  all  circumstances.  A  statement \nmade outside of the U.S. court proceedings would not \nreceive  deference  under  this  standard,  nor  would  an \nunadorned assertion by the sovereign unsupported by \nany proffer of legal materials, nor would a statement \nthat  contradicted  previous  statements  regarding  the \nlaw at issue. Rather, the requirements adopted by the \nSecond  Circuit  track  the  requirements  imposed  by \nthis  Court  for  an  agency  to  receive  deference  for  its \nlegal \ndecision-making \ncombined  with  an  interpretation  not  inconsistent \nwith  the  plain  meaning  of  the  legal  provisions  or \notherwise unreasonable under the circumstances. See \nCuozzo  Speed  Techs.,  LLC  v.  Lee,  136  S.  Ct.  2131, \n2142  (2016);  United  States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533  U.S. \n218, 227-31 (2001). \n\ninterpretations: \n\nformal",
        "3 \n\n2.  Viewed  in  this  light,  every  statement  made \nby  the  United  States  in  Point  I.A  of  its  brief  aligns \nwith  the  holding  below.  See  Br.  of  U.S.  at  6-8.  The \ncourt below expressly noted that Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 44.1 makes determination of foreign law a \nquestion  of  law  and  “provide[s]  courts  with  a  greater \narray  of  tools  for  understanding  and  interpreting \n[foreign]  laws.”  Pet.  App.  22a.  It  contemplates  that \nforeign  government  statements  may  occur  in  a \nvariety of contexts other than a formal appearance by \nthe foreign government. Id. 24a-25a & 30a n.10. And \nit  would  not  credit  contradictory  statements, \nstatements  that  are  “unclear  or  unsupported,”  or \nrelevant \nstatements \nauthorities.” Br. of U.S. at 8.  \n\naddress \n\n“fail[] \n\nthat \n\nto \n\nIndeed,  to  the  extent  that  the  United  States’ \nforeign \nis  that  any  statement  by  a \nposition \ngovernment  regarding  the  construction  of  its  own \nlaws  should  be  evaluated  by  reference  to  “the \nstatement’s  clarity,  thoroughness,  and  support;  its \ncontext  and  purpose;  the  authority  of  the  entity \nmaking  it;  its  consistency  with  past  statements;  and \nany  other  corroborating  or  contradictory  evidence” \n(id.),  it  is  difficult  to  divine  what  possible  daylight \nwould exist between the Second Circuit’s position and \nthat of the United States. The Second Circuit simply \ngives content to the standard by specifying what level \nof support is needed in the specific context of a formal \nappearance  by  the  authorized  agency  of  the  foreign \ngovernment  (namely,  a  formal  evidentiary  proffer) \nand  what  standard  the  statement  should  be  judged \nby  in  that  specific  context  (reasonableness under  the \ncircumstances).  \n\n3.  Because  the  standard  articulated  by  the \nSecond  Circuit  does  not  actually  deviate  from  the \ngeneral  views  expressed  by  the  United  States  on  the",
        "4 \n\nproper  level  of  deference  to  a  foreign  sovereign’s \nstatement  of  its  own  laws,  the  United  States  cannot \nfind  an  issue  worthy  of  this  Court’s  review  without \ninserting  language  into  the  Second  Circuit’s  opinion. \nThe United States contends that “[t]he totality of the \ncourt of appeals’ opinion . . . indicates that it adopted \nand  applied  a  far  more  deferential  standard,  under \nwhich  a  court \nforeign \ngovernment’s characterization—and may not consider \nis \nother  material—unless \nfacially unreasonable.” Id. at 9. \n\nis  bound  to  accept  a \n\nthat  characterization \n\nThat  overstates  the  Second  Circuit’s  narrow \nlimited  conclusive \nholding.  The  Second  Circuit \ndeference to formal statements made before the court \nthat  are  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Its \nfinding  that  the  Chinese  government’s  proffer  met \nthose criteria does not meaningfully deviate from this \nCourt’s  finding  that  a  similar  statement  from  the \nCommissariat  of  Justice  of  the  Soviet  Union  merited \nsimilar  deference  in  United  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S. \n203  (1942).  In  this  case,  just  as  in  Pink,  the  Second \nCircuit  found  that  Ministry  had  the  authority  to \nofficially  interpret  the  regulations  at  issue,  and  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  finding  of  reasonableness  indicates \nthat  the  court  found  the  statement  complete  and  not \ncontradicted  by  any  other  interpretation  of  the \nregulations at issue. Pet. App. 6a-10a & 27a-29a. The \nSecond  Circuit’s  approach  thus  completely  matches \nthe United States’ reading of Pink, showing that this \nCourt’s existing guidance on the question of deference \nsuffices for this case and cases like it. See Br. of U.S. \nat 10-11. \n\n4.  Moreover,  the  Second  Circuit  did  in  fact \nconsider  and  reject  the  district  court’s  reasoning \nabout extrinsic evidence. Cf. id. at 9-10. In particular, \nit considered and rejected the district court’s concerns",
        "5 \n\nto \n\nthat  1)  the  vitamin  C  manufacturers  may  have \npetitioned \nlegally \nthe  Chinese  government \nmandate  the  conduct  at  issue,  2)  the  laws  may  not \nhave  been  rigorously  enforced,  and  3)  that  the  laws \nmay  not  have  called  for  “the  exact  anticompetitive \nconduct  alleged  in  the  complaint[.]”  Pet.  App.  30a. \nThe  court  rejected  the  first  concern  on  the  grounds \nthat the reason why the Chinese government adopted \nthe  regulations  does  not  determine  what  the \nissue \nfound \nregulations  mean; \nunpersuasive  given  that  enforcement  or  lack  of \nenforcement  does  not  matter \nfor  purposes  of \ndetermining  what  the  regulations  meant;  and  held \nthat  the  specifics  of  the  mandated  prices  do  not \nundermine  the  threshold  finding  that  “the  PVC \nregime,  on  its  face,  required  Defendants  to  violate \nU.S. antitrust laws in the first instance.” Id. 31a-33a. \nThe  court  below  thus  did  not  disregard  matters \noutside of the Ministry’s amicus brief so much as find \nthat the matters raise did not tell the court anything \nuseful about what the regulations at issue meant, let \nalone  render  the  Ministry’s  interpretation  of  its  own \nregulations unreasonable. \n\nsecond \n\nthe \n\n5. Other points identified by the United States \nwould  not  justify  a  different  outcome.  The statement \nthat  compliance  with  the  government’s  regulatory \nregime  was  accomplished  “without  any  government \nintervention”  (Br.  of  U.S.  at  10)  is  not  at  all \ninconsistent  with  the  Ministry’s  position  in  the \ndistrict  court  and  court  of  appeals.  Directing  the \ncompanies  to  come  up  with  a  price-fixing  agreement \nthat is “voluntary” in the sense that they all agree to \nit  without  the  government  specifying  the  price  to  be \nset  is  directing  illegal  price  fixing.

The statements did not occur in the context of a \nformal  interpretation  of  the  1997  Notice  or  2002 \nNotice. Most importantly, as the Chinese government \n“export \nhas  explained, \nadministration”  before  the  WTO  only  meant  that \nquotas  were  no  longer  imposed  and  that  special \nlicenses were no longer required. It did not mean that \nthe  government  was  out  of  all  regulation  of  export-\nrelated  activity,  and  there  is  nothing  to  suggest \notherwise.

Indeed,  the  United \nStates  has  affirmed  the  same  interpretation  of  the \nChinese  export  regime  before  the  WTO  as  that \nadopted  by  the  Second  Circuit  here.

Further,  the  Second  Circuit’s  deference \nstandard  does  in  fact  conform  to  the  deference \nstandard of the WTO and other international bodies. \nCf. Br. of U.S. at 11-12. The WTO has held that “any \nthat \n[WTO]  Member \nconsiderable  deference  be  given  to  its  views  on  the \nmeaning  of  its  own  law.”  See  WTO,  Panel  Report, \nUnited  States  –  Sections  301-310  of  the  Trade  Act  of \n1974,  WT/DS152/R,  ¶7.19  (Dec.  22,  1999),  available \nat  https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/wtds \n152r.pdf.  \n\nreasonably \n\nexpect \n\ncan \n\nformal \n\nthat  a \n\nWhile  this  does  not  mean  that  any  proffered \ninterpretation is binding on the WTO (id.), it is hard \nto  see  how  that  standard  would  be  inconsistent  with \nan  expectation \nrepresentation \nsupported  by  a  sworn  proffer  and  reasonable  under \nthe circumstances would receive conclusive deference. \nSee  Pet.  App.  25a-26a  (“If  deference  by  any  measure \nis  to  mean  anything,  it  must  mean  that  a U.S.  court \nnot  embark  on a  challenge  to  a foreign government’s \nofficial representation to the court regarding its laws \nor  regulations,  even \nis \nlaws  might  be \ninconsistent  with  how \ninterpreted under the principles of our legal system.”). \nAnd  indeed  the  U.S.  has  requested  that  the  WTO \nafford its statements “considerable deference” when it \nhas  made  a  formal  interpretation  of  its  own  law  to \nthat  body.  See  WTO,  Second  Written  Submission  of \n\nif  that  representation \n\nthose",

The Second Circuit’s holding aligns with the \nsubstantive  views  on  deference  articulated  by  the \nUnited States as well as international standards, and \nthe  only  way  the  United  States  comes  to  the  view \nthat  the  holding  is  in  error  is  by  giving  it  a  much \nbroader  reading  than  the  opinion  below  will  bear. \nThis  Court  should  therefore  decline  to  review  this \ncase,  for  it  does  not  actually  raise  the  concerns \nclaimed by the United States. \n\nII. \n\nTHE CASES CITED BY THE UNITED \nSTATES DO NOT CONFLICT WITH THE \nHOLDING BELOW \n\n1.  The  United  States  cites  three  cases \npurportedly in conflict with the decision below. Br. of \nU.S.  at  12-13.  All \nin \nRespondent’s  brief in  opposition  (BIO  at  20-22  & 23-\n24),  so  Respondents  will  only  briefly  address  here \nwhy they do not conflict with the decision below. \n\nthree  were  addressed \n\n2.  The  first  is  In  re  Oil  Spill  by  the  Amoco \nCadiz Off the Coast of France on March 16, 1978, 954 \nF.2d  1279  (7th  Cir.  1992).  In  that  case,  the  Seventh \nCircuit  deferred \nthe  French  government’s \ninterpretation  of  its  own  law.  Id.  at  1312-13.  The \ncourt  actually  stated  that  the  appearance  of  the \nFrench government made it unnecessary for the court \n\nto \n\n2 The  United  States’  footnote  citations  to  treaties  to \nwhich  it  is  not  a  party  are  therefore  not  persuasive. \nBr. of U.S. at 12 n.2.",
        "9 \n\nto  assess  whether  the  interpretation  favored  by  the \nFrench  State  was  correct.  Id.  at  1312  (“If  all  of  the \nlitigants  were  private  parties,  we  would  need  to \ndecide  whether  this  understanding  of  the  law  is \ncorrect.”). And it expressly analogized its deference to \nthe  deference  accorded \nto  U.S.  administrative \nagencies that, as noted above, is functionally identical \nto  the  standard  of  deference  articulated  by  the \nSecond  Circuit  in  this  case.  See  id.  (“Giving  the \nconclusions  of  a  sovereign  nation  less  respect  than \nthose  of  an  administrative  agency  is  unacceptable.”); \nsee also supra at 2. \n\n2. United States v. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228 (11th \nCir. 2003), likewise does not conflict with the Second \nCircuit’s  holding  below.  In  that  case,  the  Honduran \ngovernment  made  a  formal  representation  as  to  the \nvalidity  of  its  laws  during  the  pre-trial  stages  of  a \ncriminal  litigation,  but  then  completely  reversed  its \nposition  after  the  defendants  had  been  convicted.  Id. \nthat  highly  unusual \nat  1241-42.  Faced  with \ncircumstance,  and  with  finality  concerns  firmly  in \nmind,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  declined  to  unsettle  a \njudgment  premised  on  the  Honduran  government’s \noriginal representation. By contrast, in this case, the \nChinese  government’s  position  has \nremained \nconsistent  from  the  time  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  to \nthe  time  of  appellate  review,  and  the  United  States \nidentifies no contradictory construction of the specific \nregulations  at  issue  in  this  case  that  would  justify \ndenial of deference. \n\n3.  Finally,  the  United  States  cites  McKesson \nHBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F.3d 1101 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2001).  In  that  case,  Iran’s  arguments \nregarding  the  impact  of  its  corporate  law  conflicted \nwith  its  own  representations  as  to  the  content  of  the \nlaw. Id. at 1108-09. That quite obviously made Iran’s",
        "10 \n\nclaims  unreasonable  under  the  circumstances  on  the \nbasis  of  its  own  proffer.  Thus,  the  passage  in \nMcKesson  cited  by  the  United  States  does  not  even \nconflict  with  a  broad  reading  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \nholding below, let alone the narrow holding the court \nactually articulated. \n\n4.  Aside  from  the  United  States’  contention \nregarding  the  purported  circuit  conflict,  the  United \nStates  offers  no  compelling  reason for  further  review \nby  this  Court.  Since  all  of  the  cases  cited  by  the \nUnited  States  are  clearly  reconcilable,  this  case  does \nnot merit review by this Court. \n\nIII.  ACCEPTING THE UNITED STATES’ \n\nPOSITION WOULD NOT ALTER THE \nOUTCOME OF THE CASE \n\n1. Notably absent from the United States’ brief \nis  any  indication  as  to  how  modifying  the  Second \nCircuit’s  reasoning  in  the  way  the  United  States \nadvocates  would  actually  alter  the  ultimate  outcome \nin this case. In fact, the United States never actually \nclaims the district court’s judgment should have been \naffirmed  or  that  international  comity  abstention \nshould  not  have  resulted  in  dismissal  of  Petitioners’ \nclaims.  \n\n2.  This  omission  is  quite  understandable.  As \nPetitioners  observed  in  their  Second  Circuit  briefing, \n“Chinese  law  .  .  .  required  the  Chamber  and  its \nSubcommittee to actively coordinate to set vitamin C \nexport  prices  and  quantities.”  Final  Form  Brief  for \nPlaintiffs-Appellees,  at  25,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust \nLitig.,  No.  13-4791  (2d  Cir.  Aug.  11,  2014),  ECF  No. \n174 (citation and internal marks omitted). Under this \nCourt’s holdings in United States v. Trenton Potteries \nCo.,  273  U.S.  392  (1927),  and  multiple  other  cases, \nthat  amounts  to  a  concession  that  Chinese  law",
        "11 \n\nrequired Respondents to violate the Sherman Act. See \nBIO at 17-19.  \n\nThe  sole  question  at  issue  for  comity  purposes \nbefore  this  Court  is  whether  Chinese  law  conflicted \nwith  U.S.  law.  It  is  undisputed  for  purposes  of  this \nCourt’s  review  that  every  other  comity  factor  favors \ndismissal,  Br.  of  U.S.  at  20,  leaving  conflict  the  only \nissue to be resolved. As the conflict between U.S. and \nChinese  law  is  beyond  dispute  for  the  reasons  just \ngiven,  even  a  modification  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \nreasoning  by  this  Court  could  not  possibly  result  in \nanything  but  affirmance  of  the  Second  Circuit’s  core \nholding that Chinese law mandated conduct that U.S. \nlaw  prohibited,  making  dismissal  on  comity  grounds \nappropriate.  There  is  thus  no  reason  to  believe  that \ntweaking  the  articulation  of  the  legal  standard  or \naltering  its  application  as  proposed  in  the  United \nStates’  brief  would  actually  result  in  a  different \njudgment. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  additional  reasons,  the \n\npetition for a writ of certiorari should be denied.",

App. \nthis \n25a.  The  United  States \narticulation  of  the  standard  of  deference  to  a  foreign \ngovernment’s  statement  of  its  own  law  is  “not \nnecessarily  [  ]  problematic[.]”  Br.  of  U.S.  at  9.  But  it \nnevertheless  recommends  that  this  Court  review  the \ndecision  below  because  it  quibbles  with  how  the \nSecond  Circuit  applied  that  standard.  Id.  at  9-13. \nSuch  a  dispute  over  the  application  of  a  properly \nstated legal standard to the facts of this case does not \ncreate an issue worthy of this Court’s review, and the \npetition  for  certiorari should  therefore be denied,  the \nUnited States’ recommendation notwithstanding.1 \n\nconcedes \n\nthat \n\n1 Respondents  agree  with  the  United  States  that  the \nfirst and third questions presented by the Petition do \nnot  merit  review,  and  therefore  do  not  address  the \nUnited States’ arguments on those points. Br. of U.S. \nat 13-22. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                             \n\f2 \n\nI. \n\nTHE UNITED STATES OVERSTATES \nTHE SECOND CIRCUIT’S NARROW \nHOLDING AND IGNORES THE SECOND \nCIRCUIT’S EXPLANATION FOR WHY \nEVIDENCE OUTSIDE OF THE CHINESE \nSTATUTES AND REGULATIONS AT \nISSUE AND THE MINISTRY’S \nEXPLANATION OF THEM WOULD NOT \nAID IN CONSTRUING THEM \n\nin \n\nthat \n\nformally  appear \n\n1.  The  Second  Circuit’s  holding  quoted  above \nprovides  for  deference  to  the  statement  of  a  foreign \ngovernment regarding the construction of its own law \nsolely  under  the  following  conditions:  1)  that  the \nforeign  government \nthe \nproceedings, 2) that the foreign government provide a \nsworn  evidentiary  proffer,  and  3) \nthe \nconstruction given to the foreign government’s law be \nreasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Pet.  App.  25a. \nThis  standard  does not  require  absolute  deference  to \nforeign  sovereigns  in  all  circumstances.  A  statement \nmade outside of the U.S. court proceedings would not \nreceive  deference  under  this  standard,  nor  would  an \nunadorned assertion by the sovereign unsupported by \nany proffer of legal materials, nor would a statement \nthat  contradicted  previous  statements  regarding  the \nlaw at issue. Rather, the requirements adopted by the \nSecond  Circuit  track  the  requirements  imposed  by \nthis  Court  for  an  agency  to  receive  deference  for  its \nlegal \ndecision-making \ncombined  with  an  interpretation  not  inconsistent \nwith  the  plain  meaning  of  the  legal  provisions  or \notherwise unreasonable under the circumstances. See \nCuozzo  Speed  Techs.,  LLC  v.  Lee,  136  S.  Ct.  2131, \n2142  (2016);  United  States  v.  Mead  Corp.,  533  U.S. \n218, 227-31 (2001). \n\ninterpretations: \n\nformal \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f3 \n\n2.  Viewed  in  this  light,  every  statement  made \nby  the  United  States  in  Point  I.A  of  its  brief  aligns \nwith  the  holding  below.  See  Br.  of  U.S.  at  6-8.  The \ncourt below expressly noted that Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 44.1 makes determination of foreign law a \nquestion  of  law  and  “provide[s]  courts  with  a  greater \narray  of  tools  for  understanding  and  interpreting \n[foreign]  laws.”  Pet.  App.  22a.  It  contemplates  that \nforeign  government  statements  may  occur  in  a \nvariety of contexts other than a formal appearance by \nthe foreign government. Id. 24a-25a & 30a n.10. And \nit  would  not  credit  contradictory  statements, \nstatements  that  are  “unclear  or  unsupported,”  or \nrelevant \nstatements \nauthorities.” Br. of U.S. at 8.  \n\naddress \n\n“fail[] \n\nthat \n\nto \n\nIndeed,  to  the  extent  that  the  United  States’ \nforeign \nis  that  any  statement  by  a \nposition \ngovernment  regarding  the  construction  of  its  own \nlaws  should  be  evaluated  by  reference  to  “the \nstatement’s  clarity,  thoroughness,  and  support;  its \ncontext  and  purpose;  the  authority  of  the  entity \nmaking  it;  its  consistency  with  past  statements;  and \nany  other  corroborating  or  contradictory  evidence” \n(id.),  it  is  difficult  to  divine  what  possible  daylight \nwould exist between the Second Circuit’s position and \nthat of the United States. The Second Circuit simply \ngives content to the standard by specifying what level \nof support is needed in the specific context of a formal \nappearance  by  the  authorized  agency  of  the  foreign \ngovernment  (namely,  a  formal  evidentiary  proffer) \nand  what  standard  the  statement  should  be  judged \nby  in  that  specific  context  (reasonableness under  the \ncircumstances).  \n\n3.  Because  the  standard  articulated  by  the \nSecond  Circuit  does  not  actually  deviate  from  the \ngeneral  views  expressed  by  the  United  States  on  the \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 \n\nproper  level  of  deference  to  a  foreign  sovereign’s \nstatement  of  its  own  laws,  the  United  States  cannot \nfind  an  issue  worthy  of  this  Court’s  review  without \ninserting  language  into  the  Second  Circuit’s  opinion. \nThe United States contends that “[t]he totality of the \ncourt of appeals’ opinion . . . indicates that it adopted \nand  applied  a  far  more  deferential  standard,  under \nwhich  a  court \nforeign \ngovernment’s characterization—and may not consider \nis \nother  material—unless \nfacially unreasonable.” Id. at 9. \n\nis  bound  to  accept  a \n\nthat  characterization \n\nThat  overstates  the  Second  Circuit’s  narrow \nlimited  conclusive \nholding.  The  Second  Circuit \ndeference to formal statements made before the court \nthat  are  reasonable  under  the  circumstances.  Its \nfinding  that  the  Chinese  government’s  proffer  met \nthose criteria does not meaningfully deviate from this \nCourt’s  finding  that  a  similar  statement  from  the \nCommissariat  of  Justice  of  the  Soviet  Union  merited \nsimilar  deference  in  United  States  v.  Pink,  315  U.S. \n203  (1942).  In  this  case,  just  as  in  Pink,  the  Second \nCircuit  found  that  Ministry  had  the  authority  to \nofficially  interpret  the  regulations  at  issue,  and  the \nSecond  Circuit’s  finding  of  reasonableness  indicates \nthat  the  court  found  the  statement  complete  and  not \ncontradicted  by  any  other  interpretation  of  the \nregulations at issue. Pet. App. 6a-10a & 27a-29a. The \nSecond  Circuit’s  approach  thus  completely  matches \nthe United States’ reading of Pink, showing that this \nCourt’s existing guidance on the question of deference \nsuffices for this case and cases like it. See Br. of U.S. \nat 10-11. \n\n4.  Moreover,  the  Second  Circuit  did  in  fact \nconsider  and  reject  the  district  court’s  reasoning \nabout extrinsic evidence. Cf. id. at 9-10. In particular, \nit considered and rejected the district court’s concerns \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f5 \n\nto \n\nthat  1)  the  vitamin  C  manufacturers  may  have \npetitioned \nlegally \nthe  Chinese  government \nmandate  the  conduct  at  issue,  2)  the  laws  may  not \nhave  been  rigorously  enforced,  and  3)  that  the  laws \nmay  not  have  called  for  “the  exact  anticompetitive \nconduct  alleged  in  the  complaint[.]”  Pet.  App.  30a. \nThe  court  rejected  the  first  concern  on  the  grounds \nthat the reason why the Chinese government adopted \nthe  regulations  does  not  determine  what  the \nissue \nfound \nregulations  mean; \nunpersuasive  given  that  enforcement  or  lack  of \nenforcement  does  not  matter \nfor  purposes  of \ndetermining  what  the  regulations  meant;  and  held \nthat  the  specifics  of  the  mandated  prices  do  not \nundermine  the  threshold  finding  that  “the  PVC \nregime,  on  its  face,  required  Defendants  to  violate \nU.S. antitrust laws in the first instance.” Id. 31a-33a. \nThe  court  below  thus  did  not  disregard  matters \noutside of the Ministry’s amicus brief so much as find \nthat the matters raise did not tell the court anything \nuseful about what the regulations at issue meant, let \nalone  render  the  Ministry’s  interpretation  of  its  own \nregulations unreasonable. \n\nsecond \n\nthe \n\n5. Other points identified by the United States \nwould  not  justify  a  different  outcome.  The statement \nthat  compliance  with  the  government’s  regulatory \nregime  was  accomplished  “without  any  government \nintervention”  (Br.  of  U.S.  at  10)  is  not  at  all \ninconsistent  with  the  Ministry’s  position  in  the \ndistrict  court  and  court  of  appeals.  Directing  the \ncompanies  to  come  up  with  a  price-fixing  agreement \nthat is “voluntary” in the sense that they all agree to \nit  without  the  government  specifying  the  price  to  be \nset  is  directing  illegal  price  fixing.  United  States  v. \nSocony-Vacuum  Oil  Co.,  310  U.S.  150,  224  n.59 \n(1940). Achieving joint agreement on price and output \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f6 \n\nis  price  fixing  and  was  directed  by  the  Chinese \ngovernment, as the court of appeals found. \n\nto \n\nrepresentations  as \n\nSimilarly,  there  is  no  reason  to  consider  the \nWorld Trade Organization (WTO) statements cited by \nthe  district  court  (Br.  of  U.S.  at  10),  for  they  did  not \ninvolve  construction  of  the  specific  regulations  at \nissue. The statements did not occur in the context of a \nformal  interpretation  of  the  1997  Notice  or  2002 \nNotice. Most importantly, as the Chinese government \n“export \nhas  explained, \nadministration”  before  the  WTO  only  meant  that \nquotas  were  no  longer  imposed  and  that  special \nlicenses were no longer required. It did not mean that \nthe  government  was  out  of  all  regulation  of  export-\nrelated  activity,  and  there  is  nothing  to  suggest \notherwise.

Indeed,  the  United \nStates  has  affirmed  the  same  interpretation  of  the \nChinese  export  regime  before  the  WTO  as  that \nadopted  by  the  Second  Circuit  here.

Further,  the  Second  Circuit’s  deference \nstandard  does  in  fact  conform  to  the  deference \nstandard of the WTO and other international bodies. \nCf. Br. of U.S. at 11-12. The WTO has held that “any \nthat \n[WTO]  Member \nconsiderable  deference  be  given  to  its  views  on  the \nmeaning  of  its  own  law.”  See  WTO,  Panel  Report, \nUnited  States  –  Sections  301-310  of  the  Trade  Act  of \n1974,  WT/DS152/R,  ¶7.19  (Dec.  22,  1999),  available \nat  https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/wtds \n152r.pdf.  \n\nreasonably \n\nexpect \n\ncan \n\nformal \n\nthat  a \n\nWhile  this  does  not  mean  that  any  proffered \ninterpretation is binding on the WTO (id.), it is hard \nto  see  how  that  standard  would  be  inconsistent  with \nan  expectation \nrepresentation \nsupported  by  a  sworn  proffer  and  reasonable  under \nthe circumstances would receive conclusive deference. \nSee  Pet.  App.  25a-26a  (“If  deference  by  any  measure \nis  to  mean  anything,  it  must  mean  that  a U.S.  court \nnot  embark  on a  challenge  to  a foreign government’s \nofficial representation to the court regarding its laws \nor  regulations,  even \nis \nlaws  might  be \ninconsistent  with  how \ninterpreted under the principles of our legal system.”). \nAnd  indeed  the  U.S.  has  requested  that  the  WTO \nafford its statements “considerable deference” when it \nhas  made  a  formal  interpretation  of  its  own  law  to \nthat  body.  See  WTO,  Second  Written  Submission  of \n\nif  that  representation \n\nthose \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f8 \n\nthe United States of America, United States – Section \n129(c)(1)  of  the  Uruguay  Round  Agreements  Act, \n(Mar.  8,  2002),  available  at \nWT/DS221,  ¶11 \nhttps://ustr.gov/sites/default/files/uploads/Countries%\n20Regions/africa/agreements/pdfs/dispute_settlement\n/ds221/asset_upload_file327_6455.pdf.2  \n\n7. The Second Circuit’s holding aligns with the \nsubstantive  views  on  deference  articulated  by  the \nUnited States as well as international standards, and \nthe  only  way  the  United  States  comes  to  the  view \nthat  the  holding  is  in  error  is  by  giving  it  a  much \nbroader  reading  than  the  opinion  below  will  bear. \nThis  Court  should  therefore  decline  to  review  this \ncase,  for  it  does  not  actually  raise  the  concerns \nclaimed by the United States. \n\nII. \n\nTHE CASES CITED BY THE UNITED \nSTATES DO NOT CONFLICT WITH THE \nHOLDING BELOW \n\n1.

The  first  is  In  re  Oil  Spill  by  the  Amoco \nCadiz Off the Coast of France on March 16, 1978, 954 \nF.2d  1279  (7th  Cir.  1992).  In  that  case,  the  Seventh \nCircuit  deferred \nthe  French  government’s \ninterpretation  of  its  own  law.  Id.  at  1312-13.  The \ncourt  actually  stated  that  the  appearance  of  the \nFrench government made it unnecessary for the court \n\nto \n\n2 The  United  States’  footnote  citations  to  treaties  to \nwhich  it  is  not  a  party  are  therefore  not  persuasive. \nBr. of U.S. at 12 n.2. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n                                                             \n\f9 \n\nto  assess  whether  the  interpretation  favored  by  the \nFrench  State  was  correct.  Id.  at  1312  (“If  all  of  the \nlitigants  were  private  parties,  we  would  need  to \ndecide  whether  this  understanding  of  the  law  is \ncorrect.”). And it expressly analogized its deference to \nthe  deference  accorded \nto  U.S.  administrative \nagencies that, as noted above, is functionally identical \nto  the  standard  of  deference  articulated  by  the \nSecond  Circuit  in  this  case.  See  id.  (“Giving  the \nconclusions  of  a  sovereign  nation  less  respect  than \nthose  of  an  administrative  agency  is  unacceptable.”); \nsee also supra at 2. \n\n2. United States v. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228 (11th \nCir. 2003), likewise does not conflict with the Second \nCircuit’s  holding  below.  In  that  case,  the  Honduran \ngovernment  made  a  formal  representation  as  to  the \nvalidity  of  its  laws  during  the  pre-trial  stages  of  a \ncriminal  litigation,  but  then  completely  reversed  its \nposition  after  the  defendants  had  been  convicted.  Id. \nthat  highly  unusual \nat  1241-42.  Faced  with \ncircumstance,  and  with  finality  concerns  firmly  in \nmind,  the  Eleventh  Circuit  declined  to  unsettle  a \njudgment  premised  on  the  Honduran  government’s \noriginal representation. By contrast, in this case, the \nChinese  government’s  position  has \nremained \nconsistent  from  the  time  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  to \nthe  time  of  appellate  review,  and  the  United  States \nidentifies no contradictory construction of the specific \nregulations  at  issue  in  this  case  that  would  justify \ndenial of deference. \n\n3.  Finally,  the  United  States  cites  McKesson \nHBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran, 271 F.3d 1101 \n(D.C.  Cir.  2001).  In  that  case,  Iran’s  arguments \nregarding  the  impact  of  its  corporate  law  conflicted \nwith  its  own  representations  as  to  the  content  of  the \nlaw. Id. at 1108-09. That quite obviously made Iran’s \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f10 \n\nclaims  unreasonable  under  the  circumstances  on  the \nbasis  of  its  own  proffer.  Thus,  the  passage  in \nMcKesson  cited  by  the  United  States  does  not  even \nconflict  with  a  broad  reading  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \nholding below, let alone the narrow holding the court \nactually articulated. \n\n4.  Aside  from  the  United  States’  contention \nregarding  the  purported  circuit  conflict,  the  United \nStates  offers  no  compelling  reason for  further  review \nby  this  Court.  Since  all  of  the  cases  cited  by  the \nUnited  States  are  clearly  reconcilable,  this  case  does \nnot merit review by this Court. \n\nIII.  ACCEPTING THE UNITED STATES’ \n\nPOSITION WOULD NOT ALTER THE \nOUTCOME OF THE CASE \n\n1. Notably absent from the United States’ brief \nis  any  indication  as  to  how  modifying  the  Second \nCircuit’s  reasoning  in  the  way  the  United  States \nadvocates  would  actually  alter  the  ultimate  outcome \nin this case. In fact, the United States never actually \nclaims the district court’s judgment should have been \naffirmed  or  that  international  comity  abstention \nshould  not  have  resulted  in  dismissal  of  Petitioners’ \nclaims.  \n\n2.  This  omission  is  quite  understandable.  As \nPetitioners  observed  in  their  Second  Circuit  briefing, \n“Chinese  law  .  .  .  required  the  Chamber  and  its \nSubcommittee to actively coordinate to set vitamin C \nexport  prices  and  quantities.”  Final  Form  Brief  for \nPlaintiffs-Appellees,  at  25,  In  re  Vitamin  C  Antitrust \nLitig.,  No.  13-4791  (2d  Cir.  Aug.  11,  2014),  ECF  No. \n174 (citation and internal marks omitted). Under this \nCourt’s holdings in United States v. Trenton Potteries \nCo.,  273  U.S.  392  (1927),  and  multiple  other  cases, \nthat  amounts  to  a  concession  that  Chinese  law \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f11 \n\nrequired Respondents to violate the Sherman Act. See \nBIO at 17-19.  \n\nThe  sole  question  at  issue  for  comity  purposes \nbefore  this  Court  is  whether  Chinese  law  conflicted \nwith  U.S.  law.  It  is  undisputed  for  purposes  of  this \nCourt’s  review  that  every  other  comity  factor  favors \ndismissal,  Br.  of  U.S.  at  20,  leaving  conflict  the  only \nissue to be resolved. As the conflict between U.S. and \nChinese  law  is  beyond  dispute  for  the  reasons  just \ngiven,  even  a  modification  of  the  Second  Circuit’s \nreasoning  by  this  Court  could  not  possibly  result  in \nanything  but  affirmance  of  the  Second  Circuit’s  core \nholding that Chinese law mandated conduct that U.S. \nlaw  prohibited,  making  dismissal  on  comity  grounds \nappropriate.  There  is  thus  no  reason  to  believe  that \ntweaking  the  articulation  of  the  legal  standard  or \naltering  its  application  as  proposed  in  the  United \nStates’  brief  would  actually  result  in  a  different \njudgment. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  additional  reasons,  the \n\npetition for a writ of certiorari should be denied. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f12 \n\nRespectfully Submitted, \n\nJONATHAN M.
