        "1 \n\nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE \n\nThe American Antitrust Institute (“AAI”) is an in-\ndependent, nonprofit organization devoted to promot-\ning competition that protects consumers, businesses, \nand society. It serves the public through research, ed-\nucation,  and  advocacy  on  the  benefits  of  competition \nand the use of antitrust enforcement as a vital compo-\nnent of national and international competition policy. \nAAI enjoys the input of an Advisory Board that con-\nsists of over 130 prominent antitrust lawyers, law pro-\nfessors,  economists,  and  business \nleaders.  See \nhttp://www.antitrustinstitute.org.1  \n\nAAI submits this brief to inform the Court of the \nserious adverse implications for antitrust enforcement \nand  U.S.  consumers  if  the  Court  follows  the  Second \nCircuit’s rule of affording conclusive deference to a for-\neign government’s statement that its laws compelled \nprice fixing of exports to the United States. \n\n1 All parties have provided written consent or blanket consent for \nthe  filing  of  this  brief.  Individual  views  of  members  of  AAI’s \nBoard of Directors or Advisory Board may differ from AAI’s posi-\ntions.

        "2 \n\nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nIn this antitrust class action U.S. purchasers al-\nlege that Chinese companies fixed the price and lim-\nited  the  supply  of  vitamin  C  exported  to  the  United \nStates  and  elsewhere.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  of \nthe People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM” or “Min-\nistry”) appeared as amicus curiae in support of defend-\nants’ motion to dismiss and sought to explain that the \nprice  fixing  of  vitamin  C  exports  was  compelled  by \nChinese law and therefore dismissal was mandated by \nthe  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  doctrine,  the  act  of \nstate doctrine, and principles of international comity. \nPet. App. 189a. The government “regulation” of vita-\nmin  C  did  not  purport  to  apply  to  Chinese  domestic \nsales. \n\nThe district court refused to dismiss the case, find-\ning sufficient contradictory evidence of compulsion to \nwarrant further factual development. Pet. App. 186a. \nAnother district judge ruled against the defendants on \nsummary  judgment  and  concluded  that  Chinese  law \ndid not compel defendants to fix prices or restrict out-\nput. Id. at 56a. Moreover, the court found, to the ex-\ntent  Chinese  law  compelled  any  price  fixing,  the \ncompanies  were  only  directed  to  establish  minimum \nprices to avoid international dumping violations, and \nhence agreements to engage in supracompetitive pric-\ning or to restrict output would go beyond any defense \nbased on compulsion. Id. at 106a, 139a-142a.  \n\nA  jury  found  unlawful  price  fixing  and  awarded \n$54.1  million  in  damages  before  trebling.  Pet.  App.",
        "3 \n\n276a-279a. In its special verdict, the jury found that \ndefendants  had  failed  to  prove  they  were  “actually \ncompelled” to fix prices or limit output by the Chinese \ngovernment. Id. at 278a. On appeal, the Second Cir-\ncuit reversed the judgment and held that the district \ncourt should have granted defendants’ motion to dis-\nmiss in the first instance under principles of interna-\ntional comity. Id. at 3a. It concluded there was a “true \nconflict” between U.S. and Chinese law based on state-\nments in MOFCOM’s brief, to which the court held it \nwas  “bound  to  defer.”  Id.  at  25a,  33a.  The  court  em-\nphasized  that  “deference  in  this  case  is  particularly \nimportant because of the unique and complex nature \nof  the  Chinese  .  .  .  economic-regulatory  system”  and \n“ambiguity surrounding China’s laws.” Id. at 29a.   \n\nThe Second Circuit recognized that, in considering \nthe  weight  to  be  given  a  foreign  government’s  state-\nment that “it has compelled an action that results in \nthe  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws,”  the  court  must \n“balance the interests in adjudicating antitrust viola-\ntions  alleged  to  have  harmed  those  within  our  juris-\ndiction with the official acts and interests of a foreign \nsovereign in respect to economic regulation within its \nborders.” Pet. App. 3a. The court found “China’s strong \ninterest in its protectionist economic policies . . . out-\nweigh  whatever  antitrust  enforcement  interests  the \nUnited  States  may  have  in  this  case  as  a  matter  of \nlaw.” Id. at 37a (internal quotation marks omitted).    \n\nAs the Solicitor General observed, the court “gave \ninadequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims \nof the alleged price-fixing cartel and to the interests of \nthe  United  States  in  enforcement  of  its  antitrust",
        "4 \n\nlaws.” U.S. Cert. Amicus Br. 20. “Conversely, the court \ngave  too  much  weight  to  China’s  objections  to  this \nsuit.” Id. Indeed, it is not clear why comity demands \nthat any deference be given to a foreign government’s \nsheltering of a protectionist export cartel that harms \nU.S. consumers.  \n\nIn any event, a rule requiring conclusive deference2 \nto a foreign government’s statement that its laws re-\nquired  fixing  the  price  of  exports  would  weaken  the \nstandard  of  proof  for  establishing  the  strict  require-\nments of a compulsion defense or a “true conflict.”  The \neffect  would  be  to  substantially  impair  antitrust  en-\nforcement  and  impose  significant  costs  on  U.S.  con-\nsumers.  \n\nStrict compliance with the requirements for prov-\ning  compulsion  or  a  “true  conflict”  is  dictated  by  the \nSherman  Act’s  explicit  prohibition  of  agreements  re-\nstraining  “trade  or  commerce  with  foreign  nations.” \nPhillip  E.  Areeda  &  Herbert  Hovenkamp,  Antitrust \nLaw  ¶  273c1,  at  362  (4th  ed.  2013)  (noting  that  this \nlanguage is borrowed from the Constitution’s Foreign \nCommerce Clause). It is also consistent with interna-\ntional antitrust norms. A rule of conclusive deference \n\n2 We use the term “conclusive deference” to refer to the Second \nCircuit’s standard whereby courts are obliged as a matter of law \nto defer to the foreign government’s statement if it is reasonable \non  its  face,  without  weighing  other  relevant  evidence.  See  U.S. \nCert. Amicus Br. 9-10 (court’s inquiry limited “to the four corners \nof the [foreign government’s] brief and the sources cited therein”); \nPet.  Br.  23  (“legal  standard  .  .  .  turned  on  the  bare  fact  of  the \nMinistry’s appearance in the litigation.”).",
        "5 \n\nwould effectively lower those strict standards by mak-\ning it easier to prove compulsion or conflict when ei-\nther or both may be dubious. \n\nMoreover, ambiguity and a lack of transparency in \nthe  exporting  country’s  “regulatory”  regime  should \ncount against deferring to the government’s post hoc \nstatement  that  it  required  its  companies  to  cartelize \nexport  trade.  Protectionist  export  cartels  are  con-\ndemned internationally. It follows that a foreign gov-\nernment’s claim to have mandated such a cartel is less \ncredible when it has failed to do so clearly and forth-\nrightly. \n\nFinally,  it  would  be  particularly  unwise  to  lower \nthe  standard  of  proving  compulsion  or  conflict  at  a \ntime when we need more, not less, deterrence of inter-\nnational  cartels.  International  cartels  cost  American \nconsumers billions of dollars and continue to prolifer-\nate  despite  stepped  up  enforcement  in  the  U.S.  and \naround the world. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nA  CONCLUSIVE  DEFERENCE  STANDARD \nWOULD IMPAIR ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT \nAND HARM AMERICAN CONSUMERS \n\n“Should China be able to immunize its firms from \nUS antitrust law by saying in court: I ordered them to \ndo it?” Eleanor M. Fox & Daniel A. Crane, Global Is-\nsues  in  Antitrust  and  Competition  Law  55  (2d  ed. \n2017). To be sure, the answer this Court gives should \nafford “the same respect and treatment that we would",
        "6 \n\nexpect our government to receive in comparable mat-\nters before a foreign court.” Pet. App. 26a. But no prin-\nciple  of  comity,  including  reciprocity,  justifies  giving \nconclusive  deference  to  a  foreign  government’s  post \nhoc statement that its laws compelled price fixing. See \nU.S.  Cert.  Amicus  Br.  11  (Department  of  Justice  ex-\npects its characterizations of U.S. law will be accepted \nwhen “accurate and well-supported” and does not ex-\npect foreign courts to be precluded “from considering \nother relevant material”). \n\nThe Second Circuit’s conclusive deference standard \nobviously  has  implications  that  go  well  beyond  anti-\ntrust cases. But the fact that such a standard of defer-\nence has important adverse implications for antitrust \nenforcement and protecting U.S. consumers from for-\neign  export  cartels  should  weigh  heavily  against \nadopting it.  Whether the rubric is the foreign sover-\neign  compulsion  doctrine  or  the  “true  conflict”  re-\nquired by Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. \n764 (1993), a conclusive deference standard makes it \ntoo  easy  to  exempt  international  price-fixing  cartels \nfrom U.S. law.   \n\nA.  Strict  Compliance  with  the  Require-\nments  of  a  Compulsion  Defense  or  a \n“True Conflict” Is Required by the Sher-\nman Act and Is Consistent with Interna-\ntional Antitrust Norms  \n\nThe  requirements  of  a  foreign  sovereign  compul-\nsion defense are strict. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Fed-\neral Antitrust Policy 1030 (5th ed. 2016) (“courts have",
        "7 \n\nconstrued  the  doctrine  rather  strictly”).3  As  the  U.S. \nantitrust enforcement agencies have pointed out, “the \nscope  of  the  defense”  is  “limited”  and  does  not  apply \nunless  “a  refusal  to  comply  with  the  foreign  govern-\nment’s command would give rise to the imposition of \npenal or other severe sanctions.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice \n& Fed. Trade Comm’n, Antitrust Guidelines for Inter-\nnational  Enforcement  and  Cooperation  §  4.1,  at  33 \n(2017) (hereinafter Int’l Guidelines). \n\nAssuming,  arguendo,  that  a  court  may  abstain \nfrom exercising jurisdiction under principles of inter-\nnational  comity  when  the  exacting  standard  for  the \nforeign sovereign compulsion defense is not met,4 this \n\n3 The compulsion doctrine has been described as a “corollary to \nthe  act  of  state  doctrine.”  Timberlane  Lumber  Co.  v.  Bank  of \nAmerica, 549 F.2d 597, 606 (9th Cir. 1976). The rationale is that, \n“‘[w]hen a nation compels a trade practice, firms there have no \nchoice  but  to  obey,’”  and  thus  “‘[a]cts  of  business  become  effec-\ntively acts of the sovereign.’” Id. (quoting Interamerican Refining \nCorp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 1291, 1298 (D. Del. \n1970)) (first alteration in original); see  Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ \n274c, at 400. But the foreign sovereign compulsion defense is lim-\nited because otherwise it “would permit foreign governments, op-\nerating perhaps at the instigation of private parties, to carve out \nlarge exceptions to the application of antitrust to American for-\neign  and  even  domestic  commerce.”  1  Spencer  Weber  Waller  & \nAndre Fiebig, Antitrust and American Business Abroad § 9:23, at \n9-83-84 (4th ed. 2017). \n\n4 This Court declined to grant certiorari on the question whether \ncomity provides an independent basis upon which courts may as-\nsert discretionary authority to abstain from exercising Sherman \nAct  jurisdiction.  At  a  minimum,  as  the  Solicitor  General  has \npointed  out,  “Comity-based  dismissals  should  be  rare,  because \nCongress unambiguously intended the Sherman Act to reach for-",
        "8 \n\nCourt  still  requires  a  defendant  to  establish  a  “true \nconflict”  between  the  laws  of  a  foreign  state  and  the \nantitrust  laws.  Hartford  Fire,  509  U.S.  at  798.  That \nmeans  “compliance  with  the  laws  of  both  countries \n[must have been] impossible.” Id. at 799; Int’l Guide-\nlines § 4.1, at 29 (“no conflict of law exists if a person . \n. . can comply with both”); see Pet. App. 16a-18a (court \nof appeals assumed, but did not decide, that a true con-\nflict is required).5 \n\nThe  necessity  for  strict  compliance  with  the  re-\nquirements  of  the  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  de-\nfense  or  a  “true  conflict”  not  only  reflects  the  wide \nscope  of  Sherman  Act  jurisdiction  and  our  national \npolicy  favoring  competition,  but  it  also  is  consistent \nwith the worldwide trend to favor open markets and \npunish  price  fixing.  “As  more  jurisdictions  have \nadopted and enforce antitrust laws that are compati-\nble with those of the United States, it has become in-\ncreasingly  common  that  no  conflict  exists  between \nU.S. antitrust enforcement interests and the laws or \npolicies of a foreign sovereign.” Int’l Guidelines § 4.1, \nat 28-29; id. at 28 (“conflicts of law are rare”). Indeed, \n\neign conduct and because federal courts ‘have the power, and or-\ndinarily the obligation, to decide cases and controversies properly \npresented to them.’” U.S. Cert. Amicus Br. 19 (quoting W.S. Kirk-\npatrick  &  Co.  v.  Environmental  Tectonics  Corp.,  Int’l,  493  U.S. \n400, 409 (1990)); see also Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 273c1, at 367 \n(“[T]o the extent the antitrust laws represent the public economic \npolicy of the United States, there may be little room for consider-\nations of comity at all.”). \n\n5 While adopting a comity balancing test, the Second Circuit rec-\nognized that a true conflict is a necessary but not sufficient con-\ndition for satisfying the test. Other comity factors would still have \nto be considered. See Pet. App. 17a.",
        "9 \n\n“over 130 jurisdictions have enacted antitrust laws as \na  means  to  ensure  open  and  free  markets,  promote \nconsumer welfare, and prevent conduct that impedes \ncompetition.”  Id.  §  1,  at  2.  The  proliferation  of  anti-\ntrust regimes around the world has been described by \nscholars as “astonishing.” E.g., William E. Kovacic & \nMarianela  Lopez-Galdos,  Lifecycles  of  Competition \nSystems: Explaining Variation in the Implementation \nof  New  Regimes,  79  Law  &  Contemp.  Probs.  85,  86 \n(2016).6   \n\nAmong the countries to adopt robust antitrust laws \nis  China,  which  enacted  its  Anti-Monopoly  Law  in \n2007. Even before then, “[i]mportant laws and admin-\nistrative  regulations  involving  anti-monopoly  issues \nwere adopted in the 1990s” in pursuit of establishing \na  “socialist  market  economy.”  Zhenguo  Wu,  Perspec-\ntives on the Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law, 75 Antitrust \nL.J. 73, 74 (2008); see also World Trade Org., Report \nof the Working Party on the Accession of China ¶ 65, \nat  12,  WT/ACC/CHN/49  (Oct.  1,  2001)  (hereinafter \n2001 WTO Report) (Chinese government represented \nthat it “encouraged fair competition and was against \nacts of unfair competition of all kinds”). \n\n6 The world has changed dramatically since the mid-1980s when \nthe  Justice  Department  offered  an  arguably  more  deferential \nstandard toward foreign government statements concerning com-\npulsion. See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Sup-\nporting Petitioners at 18, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986) (No. 83-2004), 1985 WL 669667 \n(filed June 17, 1985) (“United States’ trading partners often man-\nage their domestic economic systems and international affairs in \nways that differ from ours” and “sometimes cartelize important \nsegments of their economies”).",
        "10 \n\nPrice fixing in particular is universally condemned \nand increasingly subject to harsh penalties around the \nglobe. See DLA Piper, Cartel Enforcement Global Re-\nview–June 2017. To be sure, government price regula-\ntion of some markets is not uncommon in the United \nStates and elsewhere. However, it is a basic principle \nin the United States that a state may not “simply au-\nthorize[]  price  setting  and  enforce[]  the  prices  estab-\nlished by private parties.” Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers \nAss’n  v.  Midcal  Aluminum,  Inc.,  445  U.S.  97,  105 \n(1980); Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351 (1943) (“a \nstate does not give immunity to those who violate the \n[antitrust law] by authorizing them to violate it, or by \ndeclaring that their action is lawful”). \n\nA similar principle against delegating “regulatory” \nauthority  to  companies  to  fix  prices  applies  in  many \ncountries.  See,  e.g.,  Org.  for  Econ.  Co-operation  and \nDev.,  Directorate  for  Fin.  &  Ent.  Affairs  Comp. \nComm.,  The  Regulated  Conduct  Defence  at  38, \nDAF/COMP(2011)3 (Sep. 1, 2011) (“regulated conduct \ndefense” applies “only restrictively” and does not per-\nmit  “private  actors  to  determine  when  marketplace \noutcomes are unacceptable or not”). Moreover, protec-\ntionist, state-sponsored export cartels are afforded lit-\ntle respect among the community of nations. See, e.g., \nOrg. for Econ. Co-operation and Dev., OECD Business \nand Finance Outlook 2017 § 4.5, at 155-57 (2017) (call-\ning  for  “elimination  of  explicit  export  cartel  exemp-\ntions  in  competition  laws,”  competition  authorities \n“sharing  information  and  collaborating  in  investiga-\ntions” of export cartels, and “positive comity” whereby \n“exporting  competition  authorities  alert[]  importing",
        "11 \n\ncountry  authorities  about  potential  harmful  export \ncartel conduct”).7 \n\nB.  Conclusive  Deference  to  a  Foreign  Gov-\nernment’s Contention that Its Laws Com-\npelled  Price  Fixing  Undermines  the \nStrict Requirements for Proving a Com-\npulsion Defense or a “True Conflict”  \n\nGiving  conclusive  deference  to  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s  post  hoc  statement  that  its  laws  compelled \nprice  fixing  necessarily  weakens  antitrust  enforce-\nment  by  making  it  easier  to  prove  a  compulsion  de-\nfense or “true conflict” when the foreign law is unclear. \nUnder a conclusive deference standard, courts would \nbe unable to look behind such a statement even when \na plaintiff offers good reason to do so. See U.S. Cert. \nAmicus  Br.  9-10.  A  foreign  government’s  statement \nmay be less accurate or persuasive than other inter-\n\n7 Even the United States has certain protectionist exemptions to \nthe Sherman Act, such as the Webb-Pomerene Act of 1918 and \nthe Export Trading Company Act of 1982, which exempt export \ncartels  that  meet  certain  requirements.  See  15  U.S.C.  §§  61  et \nseq.; 15 U.S.C. §§ 4001 et seq. Importantly, however, the United \nStates recognizes that exemption from U.S. antitrust laws under \nthe  Webb-Pomerene  Act  does  not  “provide  any  immunity  from \nprosecution under foreign antitrust laws.” Int’l Guidelines § 2.8, \nat  12  &  n.55  (noting  foreign  actions  brought  against  Webb-\nPomerene cartels for violating foreign antitrust laws).  Even spe-\ncific authorization by the Secretary of Commerce under the Ex-\nport  Trading  Company  Act  “does  not  constitute,  explicitly  or \nimplicitly, an endorsement or opinion . . . concerning the legality \nof such business plans under the laws of any foreign country” nor \n“insulate conduct from investigation or enforcement by a foreign \nantitrust authority.” Id. § 2.9, at 14.",
        "12 \n\npretations. And the risk that a country will manufac-\nture such a statement to immunize its nationals from \nU.S. antitrust law seems ever present. The risk may \nbe  particularly  pronounced  when  a  foreign  govern-\nment has a proprietary interest at stake as the owner \nof an enterprise that is a defendant. Cf. Amalgamated \nSugar Co. v. Vilsack, 563 F.3d 822, 834 (9th Cir. 2009) \n(less deference may be owed to agency interpretation \nwhere it has self-serving or pecuniary interest); N.C. \nState  Bd.  of  Dental  Exam’rs  v.  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n, \n135  S.  Ct.  1101,  1114  (2015)  (“not  question[ing]  the \ngood  faith  of  state  officers”  to  recognize  “structural \nrisk of market participants’ confusing their own inter-\nests with the State’s policy goals”).  \n\nMoreover, conclusive deference distorts and under-\nmines the limitations on a compulsion or true conflict \ndefense. For example, the Second Circuit in this case, \nby affording conclusive deference to MOFCOM’s state-\nment that “the defendants were required by the laws \nof China to engage in the [challenged] conduct,” Pet. \nApp. 190a, elided three important questions about the \nscope of a compulsion or true conflict defense.   \n\nFirst, if a foreign sovereign sets a price floor, is a \nconspiracy to price in excess of that floor or to restrict \noutput “compelled”? Without citing any authority, the \nSecond Circuit answered yes, and hence evidence that \nsuggested defendants “in fact charged prices in excess \nof  those  mandated,”  and  that  their  “specific  conduct \nwas  not  compelled,”  was  irrelevant.  Pet.  App.    32a, \n33a. But the answer is obviously no under the compul-\nsion doctrine. See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Car-\nbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 706 (1962) (private",
        "13 \n\nforeign subsidiary serving as agent of Canadian Gov-\nernment’s  Metals  Controller  was  not  “compelled” \nwhere it used import-control authority to exclude rival \nalloy in furtherance of a conspiracy to monopolize U.S. \nmarket); see Int’l Guidelines § 4.2.2, at 33, n.123 (“Dis-\ncretionary  conduct  is  .  .  .  outside  the  protections  af-\nforded by this defense.” (citing Continental Ore)); In re \nJapanese  Elec.  Prods.  Antitrust  Litig.,  723  F.2d  238, \n315 (3d Cir. 1983) (American firms’ challenge to Japa-\nnese competitors’ alleged conspiracy to engage in pred-\natory pricing in the United States was not “compelled” \ninsofar as agreement mandated by the Japanese gov-\nernment  involved  higher  prices),  rev’d  on  other \ngrounds, Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574. \n\nNor would a true conflict exist if defendants could \ncomply  with  both  a  Chinese  mandate  to  agree  to  a \nprice  floor  to  avoid  dumping  charges  and  a  require-\nment of the Sherman Act not to conspire to charge su-\npracompetitive  prices  or  restrict  output.  Such  a \nmandate certainly should not be “construed as an im-\nplied repeal of all antitrust regulation” in the vitamin \nC export market. Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound \nConf.,  383  U.S.  213,  217  (1966);  see  United  States  v. \nGosselin World Wide Moving, N.V., 411 F.3d 502, 509-\n10  (4th  Cir.  2005)  (exemption  for  certain  segment  of \nthrough-transportation  market  under  Shipping  Act \ndoes not extend to entire through-transportation mar-\nket); In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litig., 238 \nF.Supp.3d 1313, 1328 (N.D. Ala. 2017) (exemption for \ninsurance  ratemaking  activity  under  filed-rate  doc-\ntrine does not extend to rates in excess of those that \nwere filed).",
        "14 \n\nSecond, is conduct “compelled” if the foreign law is \nnot enforced and may be safely ignored? The Second \nCircuit simply assumed as much insofar as evidence of \nnon-enforcement was not “relevant to the . . . regime’s \nlegal mandate.” Pet. App. 32a; see also id. at 31a (ir-\nrelevant whether defendants “complied with . . . man-\ndate”).  However,  the  compulsion  defense  would  not \napply if the mandate is not enforced. See Int’l Guide-\nlines § 4.2.2, at 33. And non-enforcement would sug-\ngest the absence of a true conflict because compliance \nwith U.S. law would not be “impossible.”  \n\nThird, if a foreign sovereign simply directs private \ncompanies to engage in price fixing, without mandat-\ning  any  particular  prices  or  providing  regulatory  su-\npervision,  is  the  setting  of  supracompetitive  prices \n“compelled”? The Second Circuit assumed the answer \nis yes,8 but the compulsion defense or a true conflict \nrequires more. See Timberlane, 549 F.2d at 607 (fact \nthat the government “‘may, as a practical matter, ap-\nprove of the effects of . . . private activity cannot con-\nvert  what \nis  essentially  a  vulnerable  private \nconspiracy into an unassailable system resulting from \nforeign  governmental  mandate’”  (quoting  United \nStates  v.  The  Watchmakers  of  Switzerland  Infor-\nmation  Center,  Inc.,  1963  Trade  Cases  ¶  70,600 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1962));  see  also  Int’l  Guidelines  §  4.2.2,  at \n\n8  The  Second  Circuit  accepted  that  the  “Ministry,  through  the \nChamber, regulated the export of vitamin C by deferring to the \nmanufacturers and adopting their agreed upon price as the min-\nimum  export  price.”  Pet.  App.  28a.  The  Ministry  had  acknowl-\nedged  that  it  “did  not  decide  what  specific  prices  should  be. \nInstead, this governmental function was delegated to the market \nparticipants and the Chamber.” Id. at 207a.",
        "15 \n\n32-33 (“[T]hat conduct may be lawful, approved or en-\ncouraged in a foreign jurisdiction does not, in and of \nitself, bar application of the U.S. antitrust laws—even \nwhen the foreign jurisdiction has a strong policy in fa-\nvor of the conduct in question.” (citing Hartford Fire)). \n\nSuch  conduct  certainly  would  not  be  immunized \nunder the state-action doctrine, which addresses con-\nflicts  between  the  Sherman  Act  and  state  law.  See \nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 274c, at 401 (discussing anal-\nogy in context of conflict with foreign law). The Sher-\nman Act does not permit “unsupervised delegations to \nactive  market  participants”  to  “regulate  their  own \nmarkets.”  Dental  Exam’rs,  135  S.  Ct.  at  1111;  see \nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 226a, at 179 (Parker does not \nallow states to “authorize (or even compel) private par-\nties to displace market competition with their own un-\nsupervised preferences”). \n\nIn short, conclusively deferring to a foreign sover-\neign’s statement about compulsion can lead a court (as \nit did the Second Circuit) to avoid delving into the de-\ntails and actual facts of implementation that may call \ninto  question  whether  a  price-fixing  regime  involved \nmerely  a  “gauzy  cloak”  of  government  involvement, \nMidcal, 445 U.S. at 106, or whether it satisfied the de-\nmanding  requirements  of  a  compulsion  defense  or \ncomity abstention based on a “true conflict.”",
        "16 \n\nC.  The Lack of Transparency of a Foreign \nGovernment’s Law is Grounds for Less, \nNot More, Deference   \n\nThe Second Circuit thought the fact that “‘Chinese \nlaw is not as transparent as that of the United States’” \nmade it particularly important to defer to the Minis-\ntry’s  interpretation.  Pet.  App.  29a  (quoting  district \ncourt). But the opposite is true. A lack of transparency \nshould  be  grounds  to  call  into  question  a  post  hoc \nstatement  that  price  fixing  of  exports  has  been  com-\npelled.   \n\nTo  facilitate  its  entry  into  the  WTO,  China  made \nrepresentations to the world trading body that it “gave \nup  export  administration”  of  vitamin  C  and  many \nother  products.  JA  319;  see  also  2001  WTO  Report \n¶¶ 50, 56, 62, at 10-12 (China represented that it had \nsharply reduced the number of products subject to gov-\nernment  price  control—identifying  those  products  in \nan annex—and that “price controls would not be used \nfor purposes of affording protection to domestic indus-\ntries”). Then, in this case, MOFCOM claimed to have \ndirected its exporters to fix prices and restrict the sup-\nply  of  vitamin  C.  The  district  court  concluded  that \nChina’s representations to the WTO “appear to contra-\ndict the Ministry’s position in the instant litigation,” \nwhich was a further reason not to defer to the Minis-\ntry’s  position.  Pet.  App.  120a-121a.  More  generally, \nthe very fact that China’s minimum export price sys-\ntem is “largely opaque” and “highly non-transparent,”",
        "17 \n\naccording to the U.S. Trade Representative,9 is itself \ngrounds  for  affording  less  deference.  Cf.  Int’l  Guide-\nlines  §  4.2.2  n.124  (ambiguous  statements  regarding \ncompulsion not given dispositive weight).  \n\nAs in the state-action context, it is important that \nforeign  sovereigns  that  mandate  anticompetitive  ex-\nport  restraints  “accept  political  responsibility  for  ac-\ntions  they  intend  to  undertake”  in  the  worldwide \ntrading arena. Fed. Trade Comm’n v. Ticor Title Ins. \nCo.,  504  U.S.  621,  636  (1992).  A  foreign  government \nshould “make clear that [it] is responsible for the price \nfixing  it  has  sanctioned  and  undertaken  to  control.”  \nId. at 633. Its failure to do so militates against afford-\ning conclusive deference to its post hoc statements. \n\nD.  Weakening  Deterrence  Is  Unwise  in  an \nEra of Rampant International Cartels \n\nInternational  cartels  are  a  scourge  of  the  global \neconomy. Known international cartels have been esti-\nmated to cost consumers around the globe more than \n\n9  First  Written  Submission  of  the  United  States,  China—\nMeasures Related to the Exportation of Various Raw Materials \n91, 100, WTO Nos.

        "18 \n\n$1.5 trillion since 1990, with North American  consum-\ners paying more than $400 billion.10 The Justice De-\npartment  has  prosecuted  dozens  of  international \ncartels,  obtaining  fines  of  over  $12  billion,  and  jail \ntime  for  over  88  foreign  nationals.11  See  generally \nMinn-Chem,  Inc.  v.  Agrium  Inc.,  683  F.3d  845,  860 \n(7th Cir. 2012) (“Foreign cartels . . . have often been \nthe  target  of  either  governmental  or  private  litiga-\ntion.”).  \n\nBut despite stepped up U.S. and foreign anti-cartel \nenforcement,  international  cartels  continue  to  prolif-\nerate.  See  Connor  at  22-23  (75  discovered  per  year); \nScott  D.  Hammond,  Deputy  Ass’t  Attorney  General, \nThe  Evolution  of  Criminal  Antitrust  Enforcement \nOver  the  Last  Two  Decades  1,  3  (Feb.  25,  2010)  (50 \nDOJ  investigations  open  at  a  time).  Deterrence  re-\nmains insufficient. See John M. Connor & Robert H. \nLande,  Cartels  as  Rational  Business  Strategy:  Crime \nPays, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 427, 429 (2012). \n\nConclusive deference, by making it easier to prove \na  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  or  “true  conflict”  de-\nfense,  will  only  undercut  deterrence,  making  cartels \nthat  harm  U.S.  consumers  more  likely.  “The  host \n\n10 See John M.

        "19 \n\ncountry for the cartel will often have no incentive to \nprosecute  it”  and  “would  logically  be  pleased  to  reap \nthe economic rents from other countries . . . [that] their \nexporters  collect.”  Minn-Chem,  683  F.3d  at  860.  The \nsame incentive may lead foreign governments to lend \ntheir support to export cartels when challenged in U.S. \ncourts.  And  even  if  such  support  is  not  forthcoming, \ndeterrence is lessened if foreign firms believe that they \ncan immunize their export cartels under U.S. law by \nobtaining  a  statement  from  their  government  that \ntheir conduct was compelled.  \n\nForeign  firms  should  expect  instead  that  when \nthey export their goods to the United States, they will \nbe subject to the full effect of U.S. antitrust laws. \n\n*** \n\nIn  sum,  a  general  rule  of  conclusive  deference  in \nthe  antitrust  context  imposes  real  costs  on  antitrust \nenforcement and U.S. consumers. These effects should \nweigh heavily against adopting such a rule.",

It serves the public through research, ed-\nucation,  and  advocacy  on  the  benefits  of  competition \nand the use of antitrust enforcement as a vital compo-\nnent of national and international competition policy. \nAAI enjoys the input of an Advisory Board that con-\nsists of over 130 prominent antitrust lawyers, law pro-\nfessors,  economists,  and  business \nleaders.  See \nhttp://www.antitrustinstitute.org.1  \n\nAAI submits this brief to inform the Court of the \nserious adverse implications for antitrust enforcement \nand  U.S.  consumers  if  the  Court  follows  the  Second \nCircuit’s rule of affording conclusive deference to a for-\neign government’s statement that its laws compelled \nprice fixing of exports to the United States. \n\n1 All parties have provided written consent or blanket consent for \nthe  filing  of  this  brief.  Individual  views  of  members  of  AAI’s \nBoard of Directors or Advisory Board may differ from AAI’s posi-\ntions.  Certain  members  of  AAI’s  Advisory  Board  or  their  law \nfirms represent petitioners, but they played no role in AAI’s de-\nliberations  with  respect  to  filing  of  the  brief.  No  counsel  for  a \nparty has authored this brief in whole or in part, and no person \nother  than  amicus  curiae  has  made  a  monetary  contribution  to \nfund its preparation or submission. \n\n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f2 \n\nINTRODUCTION AND \nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nIn this antitrust class action U.S. purchasers al-\nlege that Chinese companies fixed the price and lim-\nited  the  supply  of  vitamin  C  exported  to  the  United \nStates  and  elsewhere.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce  of \nthe People’s Republic of China (“MOFCOM” or “Min-\nistry”) appeared as amicus curiae in support of defend-\nants’ motion to dismiss and sought to explain that the \nprice  fixing  of  vitamin  C  exports  was  compelled  by \nChinese law and therefore dismissal was mandated by \nthe  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  doctrine,  the  act  of \nstate doctrine, and principles of international comity. \nPet. App. 189a. The government “regulation” of vita-\nmin  C  did  not  purport  to  apply  to  Chinese  domestic \nsales. \n\nThe district court refused to dismiss the case, find-\ning sufficient contradictory evidence of compulsion to \nwarrant further factual development. Pet. App. 186a. \nAnother district judge ruled against the defendants on \nsummary  judgment  and  concluded  that  Chinese  law \ndid not compel defendants to fix prices or restrict out-\nput. Id. at 56a. Moreover, the court found, to the ex-\ntent  Chinese  law  compelled  any  price  fixing,  the \ncompanies  were  only  directed  to  establish  minimum \nprices to avoid international dumping violations, and \nhence agreements to engage in supracompetitive pric-\ning or to restrict output would go beyond any defense \nbased on compulsion. Id. at 106a, 139a-142a.  \n\nA  jury  found  unlawful  price  fixing  and  awarded \n$54.1  million  in  damages  before  trebling.  Pet.  App. \n\n \n \n \n  \n \n\f3 \n\n276a-279a. In its special verdict, the jury found that \ndefendants  had  failed  to  prove  they  were  “actually \ncompelled” to fix prices or limit output by the Chinese \ngovernment. Id. at 278a. On appeal, the Second Cir-\ncuit reversed the judgment and held that the district \ncourt should have granted defendants’ motion to dis-\nmiss in the first instance under principles of interna-\ntional comity. Id. at 3a. It concluded there was a “true \nconflict” between U.S. and Chinese law based on state-\nments in MOFCOM’s brief, to which the court held it \nwas  “bound  to  defer.”  Id.  at  25a,  33a.  The  court  em-\nphasized  that  “deference  in  this  case  is  particularly \nimportant because of the unique and complex nature \nof  the  Chinese  .  .  .  economic-regulatory  system”  and \n“ambiguity surrounding China’s laws.” Id. at 29a.   \n\nThe Second Circuit recognized that, in considering \nthe  weight  to  be  given  a  foreign  government’s  state-\nment that “it has compelled an action that results in \nthe  violation  of  U.S.  antitrust  laws,”  the  court  must \n“balance the interests in adjudicating antitrust viola-\ntions  alleged  to  have  harmed  those  within  our  juris-\ndiction with the official acts and interests of a foreign \nsovereign in respect to economic regulation within its \nborders.” Pet. App. 3a. The court found “China’s strong \ninterest in its protectionist economic policies . . . out-\nweigh  whatever  antitrust  enforcement  interests  the \nUnited  States  may  have  in  this  case  as  a  matter  of \nlaw.” Id. at 37a (internal quotation marks omitted).    \n\nAs the Solicitor General observed, the court “gave \ninadequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims \nof the alleged price-fixing cartel and to the interests of \nthe  United  States  in  enforcement  of  its  antitrust \n\n \n \n \n\f4 \n\nlaws.” U.S. Cert. Amicus Br. 20. “Conversely, the court \ngave  too  much  weight  to  China’s  objections  to  this \nsuit.” Id. Indeed, it is not clear why comity demands \nthat any deference be given to a foreign government’s \nsheltering of a protectionist export cartel that harms \nU.S. consumers.  \n\nIn any event, a rule requiring conclusive deference2 \nto a foreign government’s statement that its laws re-\nquired  fixing  the  price  of  exports  would  weaken  the \nstandard  of  proof  for  establishing  the  strict  require-\nments of a compulsion defense or a “true conflict.”  The \neffect  would  be  to  substantially  impair  antitrust  en-\nforcement  and  impose  significant  costs  on  U.S.  con-\nsumers.  \n\nStrict compliance with the requirements for prov-\ning  compulsion  or  a  “true  conflict”  is  dictated  by  the \nSherman  Act’s  explicit  prohibition  of  agreements  re-\nstraining  “trade  or  commerce  with  foreign  nations.” \nPhillip  E.  Areeda  &  Herbert  Hovenkamp,  Antitrust \nLaw  ¶  273c1,  at  362  (4th  ed.  2013)  (noting  that  this \nlanguage is borrowed from the Constitution’s Foreign \nCommerce Clause). It is also consistent with interna-\ntional antitrust norms. A rule of conclusive deference \n\n2 We use the term “conclusive deference” to refer to the Second \nCircuit’s standard whereby courts are obliged as a matter of law \nto defer to the foreign government’s statement if it is reasonable \non  its  face,  without  weighing  other  relevant  evidence.  See  U.S. \nCert. Amicus Br. 9-10 (court’s inquiry limited “to the four corners \nof the [foreign government’s] brief and the sources cited therein”); \nPet.  Br.  23  (“legal  standard  .  .  .  turned  on  the  bare  fact  of  the \nMinistry’s appearance in the litigation.”). \n\n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f5 \n\nwould effectively lower those strict standards by mak-\ning it easier to prove compulsion or conflict when ei-\nther or both may be dubious. \n\nMoreover, ambiguity and a lack of transparency in \nthe  exporting  country’s  “regulatory”  regime  should \ncount against deferring to the government’s post hoc \nstatement  that  it  required  its  companies  to  cartelize \nexport  trade.  Protectionist  export  cartels  are  con-\ndemned internationally. It follows that a foreign gov-\nernment’s claim to have mandated such a cartel is less \ncredible when it has failed to do so clearly and forth-\nrightly. \n\nFinally,  it  would  be  particularly  unwise  to  lower \nthe  standard  of  proving  compulsion  or  conflict  at  a \ntime when we need more, not less, deterrence of inter-\nnational  cartels.  International  cartels  cost  American \nconsumers billions of dollars and continue to prolifer-\nate  despite  stepped  up  enforcement  in  the  U.S.  and \naround the world. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nA  CONCLUSIVE  DEFERENCE  STANDARD \nWOULD IMPAIR ANTITRUST ENFORCEMENT \nAND HARM AMERICAN CONSUMERS \n\n“Should China be able to immunize its firms from \nUS antitrust law by saying in court: I ordered them to \ndo it?” Eleanor M. Fox & Daniel A. Crane, Global Is-\nsues  in  Antitrust  and  Competition  Law  55  (2d  ed. \n2017). To be sure, the answer this Court gives should \nafford “the same respect and treatment that we would \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f6 \n\nexpect our government to receive in comparable mat-\nters before a foreign court.” Pet. App. 26a. But no prin-\nciple  of  comity,  including  reciprocity,  justifies  giving \nconclusive  deference  to  a  foreign  government’s  post \nhoc statement that its laws compelled price fixing. See \nU.S.  Cert.  Amicus  Br.  11  (Department  of  Justice  ex-\npects its characterizations of U.S. law will be accepted \nwhen “accurate and well-supported” and does not ex-\npect foreign courts to be precluded “from considering \nother relevant material”). \n\nThe Second Circuit’s conclusive deference standard \nobviously  has  implications  that  go  well  beyond  anti-\ntrust cases. But the fact that such a standard of defer-\nence has important adverse implications for antitrust \nenforcement and protecting U.S. consumers from for-\neign  export  cartels  should  weigh  heavily  against \nadopting it.  Whether the rubric is the foreign sover-\neign  compulsion  doctrine  or  the  “true  conflict”  re-\nquired by Hartford Fire Ins. Co. v. California, 509 U.S. \n764 (1993), a conclusive deference standard makes it \ntoo  easy  to  exempt  international  price-fixing  cartels \nfrom U.S. law.   \n\nA.  Strict  Compliance  with  the  Require-\nments  of  a  Compulsion  Defense  or  a \n“True Conflict” Is Required by the Sher-\nman Act and Is Consistent with Interna-\ntional Antitrust Norms  \n\nThe  requirements  of  a  foreign  sovereign  compul-\nsion defense are strict. See Herbert Hovenkamp, Fed-\neral Antitrust Policy 1030 (5th ed. 2016) (“courts have \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f7 \n\nconstrued  the  doctrine  rather  strictly”).3  As  the  U.S. \nantitrust enforcement agencies have pointed out, “the \nscope  of  the  defense”  is  “limited”  and  does  not  apply \nunless  “a  refusal  to  comply  with  the  foreign  govern-\nment’s command would give rise to the imposition of \npenal or other severe sanctions.” U.S. Dep’t of Justice \n& Fed. Trade Comm’n, Antitrust Guidelines for Inter-\nnational  Enforcement  and  Cooperation  §  4.1,  at  33 \n(2017) (hereinafter Int’l Guidelines). \n\nAssuming,  arguendo,  that  a  court  may  abstain \nfrom exercising jurisdiction under principles of inter-\nnational  comity  when  the  exacting  standard  for  the \nforeign sovereign compulsion defense is not met,4 this \n\n3 The compulsion doctrine has been described as a “corollary to \nthe  act  of  state  doctrine.”  Timberlane  Lumber  Co.  v.  Bank  of \nAmerica, 549 F.2d 597, 606 (9th Cir. 1976). The rationale is that, \n“‘[w]hen a nation compels a trade practice, firms there have no \nchoice  but  to  obey,’”  and  thus  “‘[a]cts  of  business  become  effec-\ntively acts of the sovereign.’” Id. (quoting Interamerican Refining \nCorp. v. Texaco Maracaibo, Inc., 307 F. Supp. 1291, 1298 (D. Del. \n1970)) (first alteration in original); see  Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ \n274c, at 400. But the foreign sovereign compulsion defense is lim-\nited because otherwise it “would permit foreign governments, op-\nerating perhaps at the instigation of private parties, to carve out \nlarge exceptions to the application of antitrust to American for-\neign  and  even  domestic  commerce.”  1  Spencer  Weber  Waller  & \nAndre Fiebig, Antitrust and American Business Abroad § 9:23, at \n9-83-84 (4th ed. 2017). \n\n4 This Court declined to grant certiorari on the question whether \ncomity provides an independent basis upon which courts may as-\nsert discretionary authority to abstain from exercising Sherman \nAct  jurisdiction.  At  a  minimum,  as  the  Solicitor  General  has \npointed  out,  “Comity-based  dismissals  should  be  rare,  because \nCongress unambiguously intended the Sherman Act to reach for-\n\n \n \n                                                 \n\f8 \n\nCourt  still  requires  a  defendant  to  establish  a  “true \nconflict”  between  the  laws  of  a  foreign  state  and  the \nantitrust  laws.  Hartford  Fire,  509  U.S.  at  798.  That \nmeans  “compliance  with  the  laws  of  both  countries \n[must have been] impossible.” Id. at 799; Int’l Guide-\nlines § 4.1, at 29 (“no conflict of law exists if a person . \n. . can comply with both”); see Pet. App. 16a-18a (court \nof appeals assumed, but did not decide, that a true con-\nflict is required).5 \n\nThe  necessity  for  strict  compliance  with  the  re-\nquirements  of  the  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  de-\nfense  or  a  “true  conflict”  not  only  reflects  the  wide \nscope  of  Sherman  Act  jurisdiction  and  our  national \npolicy  favoring  competition,  but  it  also  is  consistent \nwith the worldwide trend to favor open markets and \npunish  price  fixing.  “As  more  jurisdictions  have \nadopted and enforce antitrust laws that are compati-\nble with those of the United States, it has become in-\ncreasingly  common  that  no  conflict  exists  between \nU.S. antitrust enforcement interests and the laws or \npolicies of a foreign sovereign.” Int’l Guidelines § 4.1, \nat 28-29; id. at 28 (“conflicts of law are rare”). Indeed, \n\neign conduct and because federal courts ‘have the power, and or-\ndinarily the obligation, to decide cases and controversies properly \npresented to them.’” U.S. Cert. Amicus Br. 19 (quoting W.S. Kirk-\npatrick  &  Co.  v.  Environmental  Tectonics  Corp.,  Int’l,  493  U.S. \n400, 409 (1990)); see also Areeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 273c1, at 367 \n(“[T]o the extent the antitrust laws represent the public economic \npolicy of the United States, there may be little room for consider-\nations of comity at all.”). \n\n5 While adopting a comity balancing test, the Second Circuit rec-\nognized that a true conflict is a necessary but not sufficient con-\ndition for satisfying the test. Other comity factors would still have \nto be considered. See Pet. App. 17a.  \n\n \n \n                                                 \n\f9 \n\n“over 130 jurisdictions have enacted antitrust laws as \na  means  to  ensure  open  and  free  markets,  promote \nconsumer welfare, and prevent conduct that impedes \ncompetition.”  Id.  §  1,  at  2.  The  proliferation  of  anti-\ntrust regimes around the world has been described by \nscholars as “astonishing.” E.g., William E. Kovacic & \nMarianela  Lopez-Galdos,  Lifecycles  of  Competition \nSystems: Explaining Variation in the Implementation \nof  New  Regimes,  79  Law  &  Contemp.  Probs.  85,  86 \n(2016).6   \n\nAmong the countries to adopt robust antitrust laws \nis  China,  which  enacted  its  Anti-Monopoly  Law  in \n2007. Even before then, “[i]mportant laws and admin-\nistrative  regulations  involving  anti-monopoly  issues \nwere adopted in the 1990s” in pursuit of establishing \na  “socialist  market  economy.”  Zhenguo  Wu,  Perspec-\ntives on the Chinese Anti-Monopoly Law, 75 Antitrust \nL.J. 73, 74 (2008); see also World Trade Org., Report \nof the Working Party on the Accession of China ¶ 65, \nat  12,  WT/ACC/CHN/49  (Oct.  1,  2001)  (hereinafter \n2001 WTO Report) (Chinese government represented \nthat it “encouraged fair competition and was against \nacts of unfair competition of all kinds”). \n\n6 The world has changed dramatically since the mid-1980s when \nthe  Justice  Department  offered  an  arguably  more  deferential \nstandard toward foreign government statements concerning com-\npulsion. See Brief for the United States as Amicus Curiae Sup-\nporting Petitioners at 18, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio Corp., 475 U.S. 574 (1986) (No. 83-2004), 1985 WL 669667 \n(filed June 17, 1985) (“United States’ trading partners often man-\nage their domestic economic systems and international affairs in \nways that differ from ours” and “sometimes cartelize important \nsegments of their economies”).    \n\n \n \n                                                 \n\f10 \n\nPrice fixing in particular is universally condemned \nand increasingly subject to harsh penalties around the \nglobe. See DLA Piper, Cartel Enforcement Global Re-\nview–June 2017. To be sure, government price regula-\ntion of some markets is not uncommon in the United \nStates and elsewhere. However, it is a basic principle \nin the United States that a state may not “simply au-\nthorize[]  price  setting  and  enforce[]  the  prices  estab-\nlished by private parties.” Cal. Retail Liquor Dealers \nAss’n  v.  Midcal  Aluminum,  Inc.,  445  U.S.  97,  105 \n(1980); Parker v. Brown, 317 U.S. 341, 351 (1943) (“a \nstate does not give immunity to those who violate the \n[antitrust law] by authorizing them to violate it, or by \ndeclaring that their action is lawful”). \n\nA similar principle against delegating “regulatory” \nauthority  to  companies  to  fix  prices  applies  in  many \ncountries.  See,  e.g.,  Org.  for  Econ.  Co-operation  and \nDev.,  Directorate  for  Fin.  &  Ent.  Affairs  Comp. \nComm.,  The  Regulated  Conduct  Defence  at  38, \nDAF/COMP(2011)3 (Sep. 1, 2011) (“regulated conduct \ndefense” applies “only restrictively” and does not per-\nmit  “private  actors  to  determine  when  marketplace \noutcomes are unacceptable or not”). Moreover, protec-\ntionist, state-sponsored export cartels are afforded lit-\ntle respect among the community of nations. See, e.g., \nOrg. for Econ. Co-operation and Dev., OECD Business \nand Finance Outlook 2017 § 4.5, at 155-57 (2017) (call-\ning  for  “elimination  of  explicit  export  cartel  exemp-\ntions  in  competition  laws,”  competition  authorities \n“sharing  information  and  collaborating  in  investiga-\ntions” of export cartels, and “positive comity” whereby \n“exporting  competition  authorities  alert[]  importing \n\n \n \n\f11 \n\ncountry  authorities  about  potential  harmful  export \ncartel conduct”).7 \n\nB.  Conclusive  Deference  to  a  Foreign  Gov-\nernment’s Contention that Its Laws Com-\npelled  Price  Fixing  Undermines  the \nStrict Requirements for Proving a Com-\npulsion Defense or a “True Conflict”  \n\nGiving  conclusive  deference  to  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s  post  hoc  statement  that  its  laws  compelled \nprice  fixing  necessarily  weakens  antitrust  enforce-\nment  by  making  it  easier  to  prove  a  compulsion  de-\nfense or “true conflict” when the foreign law is unclear. \nUnder a conclusive deference standard, courts would \nbe unable to look behind such a statement even when \na plaintiff offers good reason to do so. See U.S. Cert. \nAmicus  Br.  9-10.  A  foreign  government’s  statement \nmay be less accurate or persuasive than other inter-\n\n7 Even the United States has certain protectionist exemptions to \nthe Sherman Act, such as the Webb-Pomerene Act of 1918 and \nthe Export Trading Company Act of 1982, which exempt export \ncartels  that  meet  certain  requirements.  See  15  U.S.C.  §§  61  et \nseq.; 15 U.S.C. §§ 4001 et seq. Importantly, however, the United \nStates recognizes that exemption from U.S. antitrust laws under \nthe  Webb-Pomerene  Act  does  not  “provide  any  immunity  from \nprosecution under foreign antitrust laws.” Int’l Guidelines § 2.8, \nat  12  &  n.55  (noting  foreign  actions  brought  against  Webb-\nPomerene cartels for violating foreign antitrust laws).  Even spe-\ncific authorization by the Secretary of Commerce under the Ex-\nport  Trading  Company  Act  “does  not  constitute,  explicitly  or \nimplicitly, an endorsement or opinion . . . concerning the legality \nof such business plans under the laws of any foreign country” nor \n“insulate conduct from investigation or enforcement by a foreign \nantitrust authority.” Id. § 2.9, at 14.     \n\n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f12 \n\npretations. And the risk that a country will manufac-\nture such a statement to immunize its nationals from \nU.S. antitrust law seems ever present. The risk may \nbe  particularly  pronounced  when  a  foreign  govern-\nment has a proprietary interest at stake as the owner \nof an enterprise that is a defendant. Cf. Amalgamated \nSugar Co. v. Vilsack, 563 F.3d 822, 834 (9th Cir. 2009) \n(less deference may be owed to agency interpretation \nwhere it has self-serving or pecuniary interest); N.C. \nState  Bd.  of  Dental  Exam’rs  v.  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n, \n135  S.  Ct.  1101,  1114  (2015)  (“not  question[ing]  the \ngood  faith  of  state  officers”  to  recognize  “structural \nrisk of market participants’ confusing their own inter-\nests with the State’s policy goals”).  \n\nMoreover, conclusive deference distorts and under-\nmines the limitations on a compulsion or true conflict \ndefense. For example, the Second Circuit in this case, \nby affording conclusive deference to MOFCOM’s state-\nment that “the defendants were required by the laws \nof China to engage in the [challenged] conduct,” Pet. \nApp. 190a, elided three important questions about the \nscope of a compulsion or true conflict defense.   \n\nFirst, if a foreign sovereign sets a price floor, is a \nconspiracy to price in excess of that floor or to restrict \noutput “compelled”? Without citing any authority, the \nSecond Circuit answered yes, and hence evidence that \nsuggested defendants “in fact charged prices in excess \nof  those  mandated,”  and  that  their  “specific  conduct \nwas  not  compelled,”  was  irrelevant.  Pet.  App.    32a, \n33a. But the answer is obviously no under the compul-\nsion doctrine. See Continental Ore Co. v. Union Car-\nbide & Carbon Corp., 370 U.S. 690, 706 (1962) (private \n\n \n \n \n\f13 \n\nforeign subsidiary serving as agent of Canadian Gov-\nernment’s  Metals  Controller  was  not  “compelled” \nwhere it used import-control authority to exclude rival \nalloy in furtherance of a conspiracy to monopolize U.S. \nmarket); see Int’l Guidelines § 4.2.2, at 33, n.123 (“Dis-\ncretionary  conduct  is  .  .  .  outside  the  protections  af-\nforded by this defense.” (citing Continental Ore)); In re \nJapanese  Elec.  Prods.  Antitrust  Litig.,  723  F.2d  238, \n315 (3d Cir. 1983) (American firms’ challenge to Japa-\nnese competitors’ alleged conspiracy to engage in pred-\natory pricing in the United States was not “compelled” \ninsofar as agreement mandated by the Japanese gov-\nernment  involved  higher  prices),  rev’d  on  other \ngrounds, Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574. \n\nNor would a true conflict exist if defendants could \ncomply  with  both  a  Chinese  mandate  to  agree  to  a \nprice  floor  to  avoid  dumping  charges  and  a  require-\nment of the Sherman Act not to conspire to charge su-\npracompetitive  prices  or  restrict  output.  Such  a \nmandate certainly should not be “construed as an im-\nplied repeal of all antitrust regulation” in the vitamin \nC export market. Carnation Co. v. Pacific Westbound \nConf.,  383  U.S.  213,  217  (1966);  see  United  States  v. \nGosselin World Wide Moving, N.V., 411 F.3d 502, 509-\n10  (4th  Cir.  2005)  (exemption  for  certain  segment  of \nthrough-transportation  market  under  Shipping  Act \ndoes not extend to entire through-transportation mar-\nket); In re Blue Cross Blue Shield Antitrust Litig., 238 \nF.Supp.3d 1313, 1328 (N.D. Ala. 2017) (exemption for \ninsurance  ratemaking  activity  under  filed-rate  doc-\ntrine does not extend to rates in excess of those that \nwere filed). \n\n \n \n \n\f14 \n\nSecond, is conduct “compelled” if the foreign law is \nnot enforced and may be safely ignored? The Second \nCircuit simply assumed as much insofar as evidence of \nnon-enforcement was not “relevant to the . . . regime’s \nlegal mandate.” Pet. App. 32a; see also id. at 31a (ir-\nrelevant whether defendants “complied with . . . man-\ndate”).  However,  the  compulsion  defense  would  not \napply if the mandate is not enforced. See Int’l Guide-\nlines § 4.2.2, at 33. And non-enforcement would sug-\ngest the absence of a true conflict because compliance \nwith U.S. law would not be “impossible.”  \n\nThird, if a foreign sovereign simply directs private \ncompanies to engage in price fixing, without mandat-\ning  any  particular  prices  or  providing  regulatory  su-\npervision,  is  the  setting  of  supracompetitive  prices \n“compelled”? The Second Circuit assumed the answer \nis yes,8 but the compulsion defense or a true conflict \nrequires more. See Timberlane, 549 F.2d at 607 (fact \nthat the government “‘may, as a practical matter, ap-\nprove of the effects of . . . private activity cannot con-\nvert  what \nis  essentially  a  vulnerable  private \nconspiracy into an unassailable system resulting from \nforeign  governmental  mandate’”  (quoting  United \nStates  v.  The  Watchmakers  of  Switzerland  Infor-\nmation  Center,  Inc.,  1963  Trade  Cases  ¶  70,600 \n(S.D.N.Y.  1962));  see  also  Int’l  Guidelines  §  4.2.2,  at \n\n8  The  Second  Circuit  accepted  that  the  “Ministry,  through  the \nChamber, regulated the export of vitamin C by deferring to the \nmanufacturers and adopting their agreed upon price as the min-\nimum  export  price.”  Pet.  App.  28a.  The  Ministry  had  acknowl-\nedged  that  it  “did  not  decide  what  specific  prices  should  be. \nInstead, this governmental function was delegated to the market \nparticipants and the Chamber.” Id. at 207a.   \n\n \n \n                                                 \n\f15 \n\n32-33 (“[T]hat conduct may be lawful, approved or en-\ncouraged in a foreign jurisdiction does not, in and of \nitself, bar application of the U.S. antitrust laws—even \nwhen the foreign jurisdiction has a strong policy in fa-\nvor of the conduct in question.” (citing Hartford Fire)). \n\nSuch  conduct  certainly  would  not  be  immunized \nunder the state-action doctrine, which addresses con-\nflicts  between  the  Sherman  Act  and  state  law.  See \nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 274c, at 401 (discussing anal-\nogy in context of conflict with foreign law). The Sher-\nman Act does not permit “unsupervised delegations to \nactive  market  participants”  to  “regulate  their  own \nmarkets.”  Dental  Exam’rs,  135  S.  Ct.  at  1111;  see \nAreeda & Hovenkamp ¶ 226a, at 179 (Parker does not \nallow states to “authorize (or even compel) private par-\nties to displace market competition with their own un-\nsupervised preferences”). \n\nIn short, conclusively deferring to a foreign sover-\neign’s statement about compulsion can lead a court (as \nit did the Second Circuit) to avoid delving into the de-\ntails and actual facts of implementation that may call \ninto  question  whether  a  price-fixing  regime  involved \nmerely  a  “gauzy  cloak”  of  government  involvement, \nMidcal, 445 U.S. at 106, or whether it satisfied the de-\nmanding  requirements  of  a  compulsion  defense  or \ncomity abstention based on a “true conflict.” \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f16 \n\nC.  The Lack of Transparency of a Foreign \nGovernment’s Law is Grounds for Less, \nNot More, Deference   \n\nThe Second Circuit thought the fact that “‘Chinese \nlaw is not as transparent as that of the United States’” \nmade it particularly important to defer to the Minis-\ntry’s  interpretation.  Pet.  App.  29a  (quoting  district \ncourt). But the opposite is true. A lack of transparency \nshould  be  grounds  to  call  into  question  a  post  hoc \nstatement  that  price  fixing  of  exports  has  been  com-\npelled.   \n\nTo  facilitate  its  entry  into  the  WTO,  China  made \nrepresentations to the world trading body that it “gave \nup  export  administration”  of  vitamin  C  and  many \nother  products.  JA  319;  see  also  2001  WTO  Report \n¶¶ 50, 56, 62, at 10-12 (China represented that it had \nsharply reduced the number of products subject to gov-\nernment  price  control—identifying  those  products  in \nan annex—and that “price controls would not be used \nfor purposes of affording protection to domestic indus-\ntries”). Then, in this case, MOFCOM claimed to have \ndirected its exporters to fix prices and restrict the sup-\nply  of  vitamin  C.  The  district  court  concluded  that \nChina’s representations to the WTO “appear to contra-\ndict the Ministry’s position in the instant litigation,” \nwhich was a further reason not to defer to the Minis-\ntry’s  position.  Pet.  App.  120a-121a.  More  generally, \nthe very fact that China’s minimum export price sys-\ntem is “largely opaque” and “highly non-transparent,” \n\n \n \n \n\f17 \n\naccording to the U.S. Trade Representative,9 is itself \ngrounds  for  affording  less  deference.  Cf.  Int’l  Guide-\nlines  §  4.2.2  n.124  (ambiguous  statements  regarding \ncompulsion not given dispositive weight).  \n\nAs in the state-action context, it is important that \nforeign  sovereigns  that  mandate  anticompetitive  ex-\nport  restraints  “accept  political  responsibility  for  ac-\ntions  they  intend  to  undertake”  in  the  worldwide \ntrading arena. Fed. Trade Comm’n v. Ticor Title Ins. \nCo.,  504  U.S.  621,  636  (1992).  A  foreign  government \nshould “make clear that [it] is responsible for the price \nfixing  it  has  sanctioned  and  undertaken  to  control.”  \nId. at 633. Its failure to do so militates against afford-\ning conclusive deference to its post hoc statements. \n\nD.  Weakening  Deterrence  Is  Unwise  in  an \nEra of Rampant International Cartels \n\nInternational  cartels  are  a  scourge  of  the  global \neconomy.

Agrium  Inc.,  683  F.3d  845,  860 \n(7th Cir. 2012) (“Foreign cartels . . . have often been \nthe  target  of  either  governmental  or  private  litiga-\ntion.”).  \n\nBut despite stepped up U.S. and foreign anti-cartel \nenforcement,  international  cartels  continue  to  prolif-\nerate.  See  Connor  at  22-23  (75  discovered  per  year); \nScott  D.  Hammond,  Deputy  Ass’t  Attorney  General, \nThe  Evolution  of  Criminal  Antitrust  Enforcement \nOver  the  Last  Two  Decades  1,  3  (Feb.  25,  2010)  (50 \nDOJ  investigations  open  at  a  time).  Deterrence  re-\nmains insufficient. See John M. Connor & Robert H. \nLande,  Cartels  as  Rational  Business  Strategy:  Crime \nPays, 34 Cardozo L. Rev. 427, 429 (2012). \n\nConclusive deference, by making it easier to prove \na  foreign  sovereign  compulsion  or  “true  conflict”  de-\nfense,  will  only  undercut  deterrence,  making  cartels \nthat  harm  U.S.  consumers  more  likely.  “The  host \n\n10 See John M.

[that] their \nexporters  collect.”  Minn-Chem,  683  F.3d  at  860.  The \nsame incentive may lead foreign governments to lend \ntheir support to export cartels when challenged in U.S. \ncourts.  And  even  if  such  support  is  not  forthcoming, \ndeterrence is lessened if foreign firms believe that they \ncan immunize their export cartels under U.S. law by \nobtaining  a  statement  from  their  government  that \ntheir conduct was compelled.  \n\nForeign  firms  should  expect  instead  that  when \nthey export their goods to the United States, they will \nbe subject to the full effect of U.S. antitrust laws. \n\n*** \n\nIn  sum,  a  general  rule  of  conclusive  deference  in \nthe  antitrust  context  imposes  real  costs  on  antitrust \nenforcement and U.S. consumers. These effects should \nweigh heavily against adopting such a rule. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f20 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  judgment  of  the \n\ncourt of appeals should be reversed. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\nRICHARD M.
