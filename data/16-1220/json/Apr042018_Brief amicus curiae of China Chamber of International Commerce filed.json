In  determining \nforeign  law,  the  court  may  consider  any \nincluding \nor \nrelevant  material \ntestimony,  whether  or  not  submitted  by  a \nparty or admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence.  The  court’s  determination  must  be \ntreated as a ruling on a question of law. \n\nsource, \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nIn  this  case  Petitioners  alleged  that  Respondents \nengaged  in  a  certain  price-fixing  scheme  injuring \nin  the  United  States.  Respondents \nconsumers \nclaimed  that  the  scheme  was  government-mandated \nunder  Chinese  law.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce \nthe \n(MOFCOM) \nproceedings  below  as  amicus  curiae,  described  itself \nas  “the  highest  administrative  authority  in  China \nauthorized to regulate foreign trade, including export \ncommerce”, see MOFCOM Amicus Brief in Support of \n\nparticipated \n\nof  China \n\nin",
        "4 \n\nthe \n\nsubstance  of \n\nDefendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss,  Petitioners’  Cert \nPetition,  at  190a,  and  represented  that  the  scheme \nwas  required  by  Chinese  law.  Ibid.,  191-192a  and \npassim.  Subsequently \nthis \nrepresentation  was  also  stated  in  a  diplomatic  note \nto  the  State  Department.  See  Diplomatic  Note  No. \nCE027/14 from the Embassy of the People’s Republic \nof China to the State Department, J.A. 782-783.  The \nCourt  of Appeals for  the  Second  Circuit  held  that  in \ndetermining \ncourts \nlaw, \nwere  bound  to  defer  to  this  representation,  or \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  law  in \nissue, In re: Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d \n175 \n(2nd  Cir.  2016),  referred  to  as  “binding \ndeference”  for  convenience.  Whether  this  “binding \ndeference”  is  proper  is  now  presented  before  this \nHonorable Court.  \n\nforeign \n\nfederal \n\nthe \n\nIn  this  Brief,  Amicus  respectfully  submits  as \nfollows:  I.

A  distinction \nmust  be  made,  among  the  materials  used  to \ndetermine  foreign  law,  between  what  may  count  as \nfor \napplicable \ndetermining applicable law, and the interpretation or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM \ncounts  as  applicable  law;  III.

The \n\ndeference;",
        "6 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  Rule  44.1  addresses  only  what  materials \nmay  be  used  in  determining  foreign  law,  not \nwhat  effect  to  give  to  these  materials,  which \neffect  must  be  determined  on  considerations \noutside  the  Rule,  and  is  consistent  with \nwhatever  effect  properly  derived,  including \n“binding deference”  \n\nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  44.1  provides \nthat  “[i]n  determining  foreign  law,  the  court  may \nconsider  any  relevant  material  or  source,  including \ntestimony,  whether  or  not  submitted  by  a  party  or \nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The \ncourt’s determination must be treated as a ruling on \na  question  of  law.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1.  The  plain \nterms  of  this  Rule  make  clear  that  Rule  44.1 \naddresses  only  what  materials  may  be  used  in \ndetermining  foreign  law,  not  what  effect  to  give  to \nthese  materials,  which  effect  must  therefore  be \ndetermined  on  considerations  outside  the  Rule,  and \nis  consistent  with  whatever  effect  properly  derived, \n“substantial \nincluding \ndeference”.  The \ncourt’s \ndetermination  must  be  treated  as  a  ruling  on  a \nquestion of law”, attaches a certain nature to such a \ndetermination,  which  is  a  consequence  of  such  an \n\n“binding  deference” \nlast \n\nsentence, \n\n“The \n\nor",
        "7 \n\noperation  to  determine  law,  and  does  not  affect  the \nweight or effect to be given to the materials utilized. \n\nNothing  in  the  drafting  history  of  Rule  44.1 \npoints  to  a  different  conclusion.  As  the  Court  of \nAppeals below pointed out,  \n\nfact,  and \n\nAccording to the advisory committee notes, the \nrule  has  two  purposes:  (1)  to  make  a  court’s \ndetermination  of  foreign  law  a  matter  of  law \nrather  than \n(2)  to  relax  the \nevidentiary  standard  and  to  create  a  uniform \nprocedure for interpreting foreign law. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 44.1 advisory committee’s notes to 1966 \nadoption.  The  advisory  committee  notes \nsuggest  that  Rule  44.1  was  meant  to  address \nsome  of  the  challenges  facing  litigants  whose \nclaims  and  defenses  depended  upon  foreign \nlaw and to provide courts with a greater array \nof  tools  for  understanding  and  interpreting \nthose laws. Id.  \n\nIn re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d, at 187. \nNor  do  the  treaty  provisions  resorted  to  by \nPetitioners  (Petitioners’  Brief,  45-46  &  n.13)  and  by \nthe  United  States  (U.S.  Merits  Brief,  30)  militate  in \nfavor  of  a  different  conclusion.  To  some  extent \nsimilar to Rule 44.1, these provisions address how to \nobtain materials on which to determine a question of \nforeign  law,  and  state  either  that  “[t]he  information \ngiven  in  the  reply  shall  not  bind  the  judicial",
        "8 \n\nauthority from which the request emanated”,2 or that  \n“[t]he  State  that  receives  the  reports  referred  to  in \nArticle 3.c. shall not be required to apply the law, or \ncause it to be applied, in accordance with the content \nof  the  reply  received”.3 Obviously,  this  effect  stated \nin  the  two  provisions  is  a  matter  of  treaty  law. \nClearly, they do not prevent or prohibit a contracting \nparty  from  treating  them  as  binding  by  operation  of \nlaw.  Here,  as  will  be \nits \ndemonstrated  below,  the  operation  of  US  law  does \naccord \nto  MOFCOM’s \ndeference \ninterpretation of Chinese law on trade.  \n\nown  national \n\nbinding \n\nto \n\nused \n\ndetermine \n\nII.  A  distinction  must  be  made,  among  the \nmaterials \nforeign \nlaw, between what may count as applicable law \nand  the  subsidiary  means  for  determining \napplicable  law,  and  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw  by \nMOFCOM counts as applicable law  \n\nRule  44.1  essentially  allows  courts  to  utilize \nany  useful  materials  in  determining  foreign  law.  In \nthe  nature  of  judicial  decision-making,  a  distinction \nmust  be  made,  among  the  materials  used  to \ndetermine  foreign  law,  between  what  may  count  as \n\n2   The  European  Convention  on  Information  on  Foreign  Law, \nart. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 154. \n3   Inter-American  Convention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on \nForeign  Law,  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  O.A.S.T.S.  No.  53,  1439 \nU.N.T.S. 111.",
        "9 \n\nlaw  and  the  subsidiary  means \n\napplicable \nfor \ndetermining applicable law, between rules of decision \nand the materials that may help courts reach rules of \ndecision.  The  idea  of  rules  of  decision  is  most \nfamously  codified  in  the  Rules  of  Decision  Act,  28 \nU.S.C.  §  1652,  which  states  that,  “The  laws  of  the \nseveral  states,  except  where  the  Constitution  or \ntreaties  of  the  United  States  or  Acts  of  Congress \notherwise  require  or  provide,  shall  be  regarded  as \nrules  of  decision  in  civil  actions  in  the  courts  of  the \nUnited States, in cases where they apply.” \n\nIn  the  area  of  international  law,  the  most \ninstructive  is this  Court’s teaching  in the  celebrated \ncase, The Paquete Habana: \n\nInternational  law  is  part  of  our  law,  and \nmust  be  ascertained  and  administered  by  the \ncourts  of  justice  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  as \noften  as  questions  of  right  depending  upon  it \nare  duly  presented  for  their  determination. \nFor this purpose, where there is no treaty and \nno  controlling  executive  or  legislative  act  or \njudicial  decision,  resort  must  be  had  to  the \ncustoms  and  usages  of  civilized  nations,  and, \nas  evidence  of  these,  to  the  works  of  jurists \nand  commentators  who  by  years  of  labor, \nhave  made \nresearch, \nthemselves  peculiarly  well  acquainted  with \nthe  subjects  of  which  they  treat.  Such  works \nare  resorted  to  by  judicial  tribunals,  not  for \nthe  speculations  of  their  authors  concerning \n\nexperience \n\nand",
        "10 \n\nwhat  the  law  ought  to  be,  but  for  trustworthy \nevidence of what the law really is. \n\n175  US  677  (1990),  at  700.    On  this  rationale,  a \ntreaty,  controlling  executive  or  legislative  act  or \njudicial  decision,  and,  in  their  absence,  customary \ninternational law, may be directly used as applicable \nlaw, while the works of jurists and commentators are \nonly  subsidiary  means  for  helping  courts  find  the \ncustoms  and  usages  of  various  nations.  The  binding \nforce given to the applicable law results from its force \nof law on the basis of consent or other proper exercise \nof  authority.  The  weight  given  to  these  subsidiary \nmeans  result  not  from  any  legal  force  of  these \ntheir \nscholarly  works \npersuasiveness  on  the  basis  of  trustworthy  evidence \nof  what  the  law  is.  Subsequently  this  idea  has  been \ncodified  in  Article  38(1)  of  the  Statute  of  the \nPermanent Court of International Law and the same \narticle  of  the  Statute  of  the  International  Court  of \nis  made  between \nJustice,  where  a  distinction \napplicable  law  (treaties,  custom  international  law \nand general principles of law) and subsidiary means \nfor the determination of rules of law.4 \n\nthemselves  but \n\nfrom \n\n4  The Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38, \nprovides: \n\n1.

        "11 \n\nthe  Court, \n\nApply this rationale or an analogy to it in this \ninterpretation  or \nthe \ncase  before \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM, \nas  the  authoritative  decision-maker  in  this  area—\nin  the  nature  of \nto  be  discussed  below—are \napplicable law or rules of decision, and count as such \nand  should  be  treated  as  such:  they  have  binding \nlegal  force  in  China.

The \nPink  precedent  demands  that  binding  deference  be \ngiven to it.  \n\nAt  issue  in  U.S.  v.

        "13 \n\naccorded  binding  deference  to  its  official  declaration \non the intended effect of Russian law. This precedent \napplies  to  the  interpretation  or  characterization  of \nChinese trade law by MOFCOM as the authoritative \ndecision-maker in this area. \n\nButtressing \n\ninterpretation \n\nthe  argument \n\nto  MOFCOM’s \n\nfor  binding \ndeference \nor \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  is  the  binding \ndeference  that  U.S.  federal  courts  give  to  the \nsubstantive  state  law  decisions  of  a  federal  state’s \nhighest court. It is solidly established that “the views \nof the  state’s highest court  with  respect  to state  law \nare  binding  on  the  federal  courts”.  Wainwright  v. \nGoode,  464  U.S.  78,  84  (1983)  (per  curiam);  see  also \nBrown  v.  Ohio,  432  U.S.  161,  167  (1977);  Garner  v. \nLouisiana,  368  U.S.  157,  169  (1961).  The  ultimate \nrationale  for  this  rule  is  the  fact  that  federal  states \nretain a measure of sovereignty when they joined the \nUnion. This measure of sovereignty renders a federal \nstate  similar  to  a  sovereign  foreign  country  and \nsupports the application of this rule to the treatment \nof  the  interpretation  by  a  like  authority  of  that \nforeign country.  \n\nIn  Pink,  the  decision-maker  is  the  “People’s \nCommissariat  for  Justice”,  while  in  the  Wainwright \nline of cases it is the highest court of a federal state. \nThe nomenclature is not important; what is decisive \nis  the  fact  that  each  is  the  authoritative  decision-\nmaker.  In  the  area  of  trade  law,  MOFCOM  is  such \nauthoritative decision-maker in China.",

After \nall,  the  power  of  judicial  review  in  the  style  of  the \ncelebrated  Marbury  v.  Madison  case,  1  Cranch  137 \n(1803), is not universal, or not yet, particularly not in \nthe executive-led government systems. In some legal \nsystems,  a \nthe  executive \ngovernment  is  given  the  authority  to  act  as  the \nauthoritative decision-maker in certain areas, whose \ndecisions  may  not  be  directly  invalidated  by  the \njudiciary. One need go no farther to see this than the \nUnited  Kingdom  Human  Rights  Act  of  1998.  Under \nthat act, U.K. courts are directed to interpret laws as \nmuch as possible so as to comply with the European \nConvention  on  Human  Rights—a  sort  of  Charming \nBetsy, 6 Cranch 64 (1804), in operation without such \na designation. But, if such a mode of interpretation is \nnot able to solve all problems, courts are allowed only \nto make a declaration of incompatibility between the \nlaw in issue and the European Convention, and then \nleave  the  matter  to  the  political  branches.

This  is  made  clear  recently  by  the \nSupreme People’s Court of China in Article 149 of its \nInterpretive  Directives  on  the  Application  of  the \nAdministrative Litigation Act, adopted on November \n13, 2017.5  \n\nIn any event, if there is an issue as to whether \nthe MOFCOM is the authoritative decision-maker on \ntrade law in China, this issue can be settled through \na proper process in the courts. \n\nFirst  Nat’l  City  Bank  v.  Banco  Para  el \nComercio  Exterior  de  Cuba,  462  U.S.  611  (1983),  is \ninapposite here, contrary to what an amicus asserts. \nIn that case, the Court decided not to defer to Cuban \nlaw  on  point,  not  in  the  process  of  determining \nforeign  law  or  ascertaining  what  that  foreign  law \nmeans, but after finding out what means, and did so \nfor  a  reason  not  relating  to  its  meaning.  There  is \ngreat  difference  between the  meaning  of foreign law \nand the effect it should be given in the United States. \nHere before this Court is only the question as to how \nto decide what Chinese trade law means or its effect \nin the China. \n\nRejecting binding deference and subjecting the \ninterpretation or characterization of foreign law by a \nforeign  country’s  authoritative  decision-maker  to \n\n5 Available at < http://www.court.gov.cn/fabu-xiangqing-\n80342.html> (last accessed April 3, 2018).",

The  act  of  state  doctrine  as  reflected  in \nSabbatino  also  supports  binding  deference  to \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of \nthe \nChinese  trade \nlaw  by  MOFCOM  as  the \nauthoritative decision-maker in this area \n\nThe act of state doctrine as reflected in Banco \nNacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964), \nand others “precludes the courts of this country from \ninquiring  into  the  validity  of  the  public  acts  a \nrecognized foreign sovereign power committed within \nits  own  territory”,  ibid.  at  401.

Indeed,  interpreting  and  reinterpreting \nanother  country’s  authoritative  decision-maker’s \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  its  own  laws \namounts  to  saying  that  a  foreign  country  does  not \nknow  its own laws  or  does  not  know  the meaning  of \nits  own  laws.  This  would  be  an  affront  to  an \nindependent sovereign state, and is bound to imperil \namicable and friendly relations between countries. In \nthis  case,  interpreting  and  reinterpreting  China’s \ninterpretation  or \nauthoritative  decision-maker’s \ncharacterization of its trade laws will no doubt cause \nan uproar in China, and adversely affect the already \ntense relations between the two countries. \n\nUnderpinning the act of state doctrine are also \nthe  constitutional  considerations  derived  from  the \nseparation  of  powers  in  the  United  States,  which \nrequire  the  avoidance  of  conflicts  between  the",

It \nconcerns \nof  dissimilar \ncompetency \ninstitutions to make and implement particular \nkinds  of  decisions  in  the  area  of  international \nrelations.  The  doctrine  as  formulated  in  past \ndecisions  expresses  the  strong  sense  of  the \nJudicial  Branch  that  its  engagement  in  the \ntask  of  passing  on  the  validity  of  foreign  acts \nof  state  may  hinder  rather  than  further  this \ncountry’s pursuit of goals both for itself and for \nthe  community  of  nations  as  a  whole  in  the \ninternational sphere. \n\nvery \n\nconflict \n\nbetween \n\ncase.

As \nRespondents show (Respondents’ Merits Brief, at 42-\n44),  the  executive  branch  of  the  United  States \nalready successfully argued at the WTO on the price- \nfixing  system  as  mandated  by  the  MOFCOM,  with \nthe  same  legal  framework  applying  to  different \ncommodities  there,  contrary  to  which  position  the \nDistrict Court below spoke.

Alternatively \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese \ntrade \nthe  highest \nadministrative authority on trade law in China \nshould  be \nsubstantial  deference \nanalogous to Chevron deference \n\nlaw  by  MOFCOM  as \n\ngiven \n\nOne  of  the  most  prominent \n\nfeatures  of \ncontemporary life under administrative regulation is \nthe celebrated Chevron deference enunciated by this \nHonorable  Court  in  Chevron,  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). \nThere, the Court addressed the weight to be given to \nthe  interpretation  of  a  statutory  provision  by  an \nadministrative agency receiving certain delegation of \nthe legislature. The Court held that “if the statute is \nsilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue,",
        "22 \n\nthe  question  for  the  court  is  whether  the  agency’s \nanswer is based on a permissible construction of the \nstatute”,  ibid.,  at  843.  Or,  as  the  Court  observed, \n“Sometimes  the  legislative  delegation  to  an  agency \non  a  particular  question  is  implicit  rather  than \nexplicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its \nown  construction  of  a  statutory  provision  for  a \nreasonable interpretation made by the administrator \nof an agency.” Ibid., at 844. \n\nthe  authoritative  decision-maker \n\nAmicus  submits  that,  if  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM \nis  not \nas \ngiven  binding  deference,  it  should  be,  alternatively \nand  subsidiarily,  recognized  as  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization of Chinese trade law by the highest \nin  China  and  given \nadministrative  authority \nsubstantial \nto  Chevron \ndeference.  Given  such  deference,  as  long  as  it  is \nreasonable  or  permissible  under  Chinese  law,  the \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw by MOFCOM must be respected. \n\nanalogous \n\ndeference \n\nit \n\ninternational \n\nSome have noted that the “domestic origins” of \nfor \ninappropriate \nChevron  deference  render \nrelations.

Such  “origins”  considerations \ndo not distract from the propriety of its application to \na  wider  area,  just  like  where  a  hero  comes  does  not \ndistract from his or her prowess.

Indeed,  the  two  situations  are  so  similar \nand  so  analogous  that  they  cry  out  for  the  same \ntreatment.  As  the  highest  administrative  authority \nin  the  area  of  trade  regulation,  MOFCOM  does—or \ndid  in  the  relevant  time  period—receive  delegation \nfrom  the  legislature  to  regulate  trade  matters  in \nChina, and its authority in this area is near plenary. \nIf  any  doubt  on  this  point  is  entertained,  it  can  be \nsettled through a proper process, just as the issue as \nto  whether  MOFCOM  is  the  authoritative  decision-\nmaker on trade law issues in China. \n\nBorn  of  international  comity  and  respect  for \nindependent  sovereign  states,  the  equal  treatment \naccorded to both the Federal Government and foreign \ngovernments  in  the  federal  courts  in  the  area  of \nforeign  relations  such  as  sovereign  immunities7 also \ncounsels  equal  treatment  for  the  administrative \nagencies  of both  the  U.S.  and  a  foreign  government. \nIndeed,  it  has  already  been  recognized  by  the  Court \nof Appeals in In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz Off \nthe  Coast  of  France,  954  F.2d  1279,  1312  (7th  Cir. \n\n7     See,  e.g.,  Restatement,  Third,  Foreign  Relations  Law  of  the \nUnited  States,  §  454  cmt.  d  (“as  in  regard  to  responsibility  for \nactions  of  officials  and  employees,  the  .  .  .

The  consent  of \nPetitioners  has  been  received  by  email.  Pursuant  to  Supreme \nCourt Rule 37.6, counsel for Amicus states that no counsel for a \nparty wrote this Brief in whole or in part, and that no person or \nentity,  other  than  Amicus,  or  its  counsel  made  a  monetary \ncontribution to the preparation or submission of this Brief. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                      \n\f2 \n\nthe  ICC  on  behalf  of  the  business  community  of \nChina. \n\nin  various \n\nCCOIC’s  main  responsibilities  are  to  organize \nand  promote  trade,  investment  and  economic  and \nforms,  to \ntechnological  cooperation \norganize  or  participate  in  foreign  negotiations  and \npublic-relations  lobbying  on  behalf  of  enterprises,  to \nprovide  advice  on  economic  and  trade  policy-making \nforeign  trade  negotiations,  trade  conflict-\nand \nresolution,  and  to  represent  the  Chinese  business \ncommunity  in  their  participation  in  rule-making \nregarding  the  international  economy  and  trade,  and \nto  make  policy  recommendations  to  the  United \nNations and ICC members. \n\nIn \n\nlight  of \n\nthis  mission,  CCOIC  and \nthe  business  community \nit  represents  have  a \nsubstantial  interest  in  the  developments  in  the \nUnited  States  courts,  especially  in  the  Supreme \nCourt of the United States, which are bound to affect \nthe  business  environment  in  both  China  and  the \nUnited States as well as the volume of trade between \nthem. This particular case has the potential to create \nsubstantial  disruptions  in  business  operations  in \nChina,  and,  as  such,  is  of  enormous  interest  to \nCCOIC,  its  membership,  and  the  Chinese  business \ncommunity at large.  \n\n \n\f3 \n\nFEDERAL RULE INVOLVED \n\nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  44.1  provides  as \nfollows: \n\nA party who intends to raise an issue about a \nforeign  country’s  law  must  give  notice  by  a \npleading  or  other  writing.  In  determining \nforeign  law,  the  court  may  consider  any \nincluding \nor \nrelevant  material \ntestimony,  whether  or  not  submitted  by  a \nparty or admissible under the Federal Rules of \nEvidence.  The  court’s  determination  must  be \ntreated as a ruling on a question of law. \n\nsource, \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nIn  this  case  Petitioners  alleged  that  Respondents \nengaged  in  a  certain  price-fixing  scheme  injuring \nin  the  United  States.  Respondents \nconsumers \nclaimed  that  the  scheme  was  government-mandated \nunder  Chinese  law.  The  Ministry  of  Commerce \nthe \n(MOFCOM) \nproceedings  below  as  amicus  curiae,  described  itself \nas  “the  highest  administrative  authority  in  China \nauthorized to regulate foreign trade, including export \ncommerce”, see MOFCOM Amicus Brief in Support of \n\nparticipated \n\nof  China \n\nin \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f4 \n\nthe \n\nsubstance  of \n\nDefendants’  Motion  to  Dismiss,  Petitioners’  Cert \nPetition,  at  190a,  and  represented  that  the  scheme \nwas  required  by  Chinese  law.  Ibid.,  191-192a  and \npassim.  Subsequently \nthis \nrepresentation  was  also  stated  in  a  diplomatic  note \nto  the  State  Department.  See  Diplomatic  Note  No. \nCE027/14 from the Embassy of the People’s Republic \nof China to the State Department, J.A. 782-783.  The \nCourt  of Appeals for  the  Second  Circuit  held  that  in \ndetermining \ncourts \nlaw, \nwere  bound  to  defer  to  this  representation,  or \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  law  in \nissue, In re: Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d \n175 \n(2nd  Cir.  2016),  referred  to  as  “binding \ndeference”  for  convenience.  Whether  this  “binding \ndeference”  is  proper  is  now  presented  before  this \nHonorable Court.  \n\nforeign \n\nfederal \n\nthe \n\nIn  this  Brief,  Amicus  respectfully  submits  as \nfollows:  I.  Rule  44.1  addresses  only  what  materials \nmay  be  used  in  determining  foreign  law,  not  what \neffect to give to these materials, which effect must be \ndetermined  on  considerations  outside  the  Rule,  and \nis  consistent  with  whatever  effect  properly  derived, \nincluding  “binding  deference”;  II.  A  distinction \nmust  be  made,  among  the  materials  used  to \ndetermine  foreign  law,  between  what  may  count  as \nfor \napplicable \ndetermining applicable law, and the interpretation or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM \ncounts  as  applicable  law;  III.  The  Pink  precedent \ndemands  that  binding  deference  be  given  to  the \n\nlaw  and  the  subsidiary  means \n\n \n \n\f5 \n\ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw  by  MOFCOM  as  the  authoritative  decision-\nmaker  in  this  area;  IV.  The  act  of  state  doctrine  as \nreflected \nin  Sabbatino  also  supports  binding \ndeference to the interpretation or characterization of \nChinese trade law by MOFCOM as the authoritative \ndecision-maker  in  this  area;  V.  Alternatively  and \nsubsidiarily, the interpretation or characterization of \nChinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM  as  the  highest \nadministrative  authority  on  trade  law  in  China \nshould  be  given  substantial  deference  analogous  to \nalleged \nChevron \ninconsistency between China’s representations to the \nWTO  and  its  position  in  this  case,  even  assumed  to \nexist,  does  not  affect  the  validity  of  its  position  in \nthis  case  as  a  matter  of  domestic  law  and  therefore \nthe binding deference due to it. \n\nand  VI.  The \n\ndeference; \n\n \n \n\f6 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  Rule  44.1  addresses  only  what  materials \nmay  be  used  in  determining  foreign  law,  not \nwhat  effect  to  give  to  these  materials,  which \neffect  must  be  determined  on  considerations \noutside  the  Rule,  and  is  consistent  with \nwhatever  effect  properly  derived,  including \n“binding deference”  \n\nFederal  Rule  of  Civil  Procedure  44.1  provides \nthat  “[i]n  determining  foreign  law,  the  court  may \nconsider  any  relevant  material  or  source,  including \ntestimony,  whether  or  not  submitted  by  a  party  or \nadmissible under the Federal Rules of Evidence. The \ncourt’s determination must be treated as a ruling on \na  question  of  law.”  Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1.  The  plain \nterms  of  this  Rule  make  clear  that  Rule  44.1 \naddresses  only  what  materials  may  be  used  in \ndetermining  foreign  law,  not  what  effect  to  give  to \nthese  materials,  which  effect  must  therefore  be \ndetermined  on  considerations  outside  the  Rule,  and \nis  consistent  with  whatever  effect  properly  derived, \n“substantial \nincluding \ndeference”.  The \ncourt’s \ndetermination  must  be  treated  as  a  ruling  on  a \nquestion of law”, attaches a certain nature to such a \ndetermination,  which  is  a  consequence  of  such  an \n\n“binding  deference” \nlast \n\nsentence, \n\n“The \n\nor \n\n \n \n \n\f7 \n\noperation  to  determine  law,  and  does  not  affect  the \nweight or effect to be given to the materials utilized. \n\nNothing  in  the  drafting  history  of  Rule  44.1 \npoints  to  a  different  conclusion.  As  the  Court  of \nAppeals below pointed out,  \n\nfact,  and \n\nAccording to the advisory committee notes, the \nrule  has  two  purposes:  (1)  to  make  a  court’s \ndetermination  of  foreign  law  a  matter  of  law \nrather  than \n(2)  to  relax  the \nevidentiary  standard  and  to  create  a  uniform \nprocedure for interpreting foreign law. Fed. R. \nCiv. P. 44.1 advisory committee’s notes to 1966 \nadoption.  The  advisory  committee  notes \nsuggest  that  Rule  44.1  was  meant  to  address \nsome  of  the  challenges  facing  litigants  whose \nclaims  and  defenses  depended  upon  foreign \nlaw and to provide courts with a greater array \nof  tools  for  understanding  and  interpreting \nthose laws. Id.  \n\nIn re Vitamin C Antitrust Litigation, 837 F.3d, at 187. \nNor  do  the  treaty  provisions  resorted  to  by \nPetitioners  (Petitioners’  Brief,  45-46  &  n.13)  and  by \nthe  United  States  (U.S.  Merits  Brief,  30)  militate  in \nfavor  of  a  different  conclusion.  To  some  extent \nsimilar to Rule 44.1, these provisions address how to \nobtain materials on which to determine a question of \nforeign  law,  and  state  either  that  “[t]he  information \ngiven  in  the  reply  shall  not  bind  the  judicial \n\n \n \n \n \n \n\f8 \n\nauthority from which the request emanated”,2 or that  \n“[t]he  State  that  receives  the  reports  referred  to  in \nArticle 3.c. shall not be required to apply the law, or \ncause it to be applied, in accordance with the content \nof  the  reply  received”.3 Obviously,  this  effect  stated \nin  the  two  provisions  is  a  matter  of  treaty  law. \nClearly, they do not prevent or prohibit a contracting \nparty  from  treating  them  as  binding  by  operation  of \nlaw.  Here,  as  will  be \nits \ndemonstrated  below,  the  operation  of  US  law  does \naccord \nto  MOFCOM’s \ndeference \ninterpretation of Chinese law on trade.  \n\nown  national \n\nbinding \n\nto \n\nused \n\ndetermine \n\nII.  A  distinction  must  be  made,  among  the \nmaterials \nforeign \nlaw, between what may count as applicable law \nand  the  subsidiary  means  for  determining \napplicable  law,  and  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw  by \nMOFCOM counts as applicable law  \n\nRule  44.1  essentially  allows  courts  to  utilize \nany  useful  materials  in  determining  foreign  law.  In \nthe  nature  of  judicial  decision-making,  a  distinction \nmust  be  made,  among  the  materials  used  to \ndetermine  foreign  law,  between  what  may  count  as \n\n2   The  European  Convention  on  Information  on  Foreign  Law, \nart. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 154. \n3   Inter-American  Convention  on  Proof  of  and  Information  on \nForeign  Law,  art.  6,  May  8,  1979,  O.A.S.T.S.  No.  53,  1439 \nU.N.T.S. 111. \n\n \n \n \n                                                      \n\f9 \n\nlaw  and  the  subsidiary  means \n\napplicable \nfor \ndetermining applicable law, between rules of decision \nand the materials that may help courts reach rules of \ndecision.  The  idea  of  rules  of  decision  is  most \nfamously  codified  in  the  Rules  of  Decision  Act,  28 \nU.S.C.  §  1652,  which  states  that,  “The  laws  of  the \nseveral  states,  except  where  the  Constitution  or \ntreaties  of  the  United  States  or  Acts  of  Congress \notherwise  require  or  provide,  shall  be  regarded  as \nrules  of  decision  in  civil  actions  in  the  courts  of  the \nUnited States, in cases where they apply.” \n\nIn  the  area  of  international  law,  the  most \ninstructive  is this  Court’s teaching  in the  celebrated \ncase, The Paquete Habana: \n\nInternational  law  is  part  of  our  law,  and \nmust  be  ascertained  and  administered  by  the \ncourts  of  justice  of  appropriate  jurisdiction  as \noften  as  questions  of  right  depending  upon  it \nare  duly  presented  for  their  determination. \nFor this purpose, where there is no treaty and \nno  controlling  executive  or  legislative  act  or \njudicial  decision,  resort  must  be  had  to  the \ncustoms  and  usages  of  civilized  nations,  and, \nas  evidence  of  these,  to  the  works  of  jurists \nand  commentators  who  by  years  of  labor, \nhave  made \nresearch, \nthemselves  peculiarly  well  acquainted  with \nthe  subjects  of  which  they  treat.  Such  works \nare  resorted  to  by  judicial  tribunals,  not  for \nthe  speculations  of  their  authors  concerning \n\nexperience \n\nand \n\n \n \n\f10 \n\nwhat  the  law  ought  to  be,  but  for  trustworthy \nevidence of what the law really is. \n\n175  US  677  (1990),  at  700.    On  this  rationale,  a \ntreaty,  controlling  executive  or  legislative  act  or \njudicial  decision,  and,  in  their  absence,  customary \ninternational law, may be directly used as applicable \nlaw, while the works of jurists and commentators are \nonly  subsidiary  means  for  helping  courts  find  the \ncustoms  and  usages  of  various  nations.  The  binding \nforce given to the applicable law results from its force \nof law on the basis of consent or other proper exercise \nof  authority.  The  weight  given  to  these  subsidiary \nmeans  result  not  from  any  legal  force  of  these \ntheir \nscholarly  works \npersuasiveness  on  the  basis  of  trustworthy  evidence \nof  what  the  law  is.  Subsequently  this  idea  has  been \ncodified  in  Article  38(1)  of  the  Statute  of  the \nPermanent Court of International Law and the same \narticle  of  the  Statute  of  the  International  Court  of \nis  made  between \nJustice,  where  a  distinction \napplicable  law  (treaties,  custom  international  law \nand general principles of law) and subsidiary means \nfor the determination of rules of law.4 \n\nthemselves  but \n\nfrom \n\n4  The Statute of the International Court of Justice, Article 38, \nprovides: \n\n1. The Court, whose function is to decide in accordance with \ninternational law such disputes as are submitted to it, shall \napply:  \n\na. \n\ninternational  conventions,  whether  general  or \nexpressly \nparticular, \nrecognized by the contesting states;  \n\nestablishing \n\nrules \n\n \n \n                                                      \n\f11 \n\nthe  Court, \n\nApply this rationale or an analogy to it in this \ninterpretation  or \nthe \ncase  before \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM, \nas  the  authoritative  decision-maker  in  this  area—\nin  the  nature  of \nto  be  discussed  below—are \napplicable law or rules of decision, and count as such \nand  should  be  treated  as  such:  they  have  binding \nlegal  force  in  China.  As  a  result,  the  statements \ninterpretation  or \nin \nmade  by  MOFCOM \ncharacterization Chinese trade law cannot be treated \nas \nthe \ndetermination of foreign law.  \n\nsubsidiary  means \n\nsimple \n\nsome \n\nfor \n\nits \n\nb. \n\nc. \n\ninternational  custom,  as  evidence  of  a  general \npractice accepted as law;  \nthe general principles of law recognized by civilized \nnations;  \n\nd.  subject  to  the  provisions  of  Article  59,  judicial \ndecisions  and  the  eachings  of  the  most  highly \nqualified  publicists  of  the  various  nations,  as \nsubsidiary  means  for  the  determination  of  rules  of \nlaw. \n\n \n                                                                                                             \n\f12 \n\nIII.  The  Pink  precedent  demands  that  binding \ndeference  be  given  to  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw  by \nMOFCOM  as  the  authoritative  decision-maker \nin this area \n\nThe \n\ninterpretation  or  characterization  of \nChinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM  in  this  case  is  that \nof  the  authoritative  decision-maker  in  China.  The \nPink  precedent  demands  that  binding  deference  be \ngiven to it.  \n\nAt  issue  in  U.S.  v.  Pink,  315  U.S.  203  (1942), \nwas  the  intended  exterritorial  effect  of  a  Russian \nevidence  was  presented, \ndecree.  Voluminous \nincluding  an  official  declaration  of  the  “People’s \nCommissariat  for  Justice  of  the  R.S.F.S.R”.  The \nCourt said, “We do not stop to review all the evidence \nin the voluminous record of the Moscow case bearing \non  the  question  of  the  extraterritorial  effect  of  the \nRussian decrees of nationalization”, ibid., at 218, and \nheld  that  “[t]he  referee  in  the  Moscow  case  found, \nand  the  evidence  supported  his  finding,  that  the \nCommissariat  for  Justice  has  power  to  interpret \nexisting  Russian  law.  That  being  true  this  official \ndeclaration  is  conclusive  so  far  as  the  intended \nextraterritorial  effect  of  the  Russian  decree  is \nconcerned.”  Ibid.,  at  220.  The  word  “interpret”  here \nobviously means “authoritatively interpret”; that is to \nsay,  the  “People’s  Commissariat  of  Justice”  was  the \nthe  Court \nauthoritative  decision-maker,  and \n\n \n \n \n\f13 \n\naccorded  binding  deference  to  its  official  declaration \non the intended effect of Russian law. This precedent \napplies  to  the  interpretation  or  characterization  of \nChinese trade law by MOFCOM as the authoritative \ndecision-maker in this area. \n\nButtressing \n\ninterpretation \n\nthe  argument \n\nto  MOFCOM’s \n\nfor  binding \ndeference \nor \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  is  the  binding \ndeference  that  U.S.  federal  courts  give  to  the \nsubstantive  state  law  decisions  of  a  federal  state’s \nhighest court. It is solidly established that “the views \nof the  state’s highest court  with  respect  to state  law \nare  binding  on  the  federal  courts”.  Wainwright  v. \nGoode,  464  U.S.  78,  84  (1983)  (per  curiam);  see  also \nBrown  v.  Ohio,  432  U.S.  161,  167  (1977);  Garner  v. \nLouisiana,  368  U.S.  157,  169  (1961).  The  ultimate \nrationale  for  this  rule  is  the  fact  that  federal  states \nretain a measure of sovereignty when they joined the \nUnion. This measure of sovereignty renders a federal \nstate  similar  to  a  sovereign  foreign  country  and \nsupports the application of this rule to the treatment \nof  the  interpretation  by  a  like  authority  of  that \nforeign country.  \n\nIn  Pink,  the  decision-maker  is  the  “People’s \nCommissariat  for  Justice”,  while  in  the  Wainwright \nline of cases it is the highest court of a federal state. \nThe nomenclature is not important; what is decisive \nis  the  fact  that  each  is  the  authoritative  decision-\nmaker.  In  the  area  of  trade  law,  MOFCOM  is  such \nauthoritative decision-maker in China.  \n\n \n \n \n\f14 \n\nin  trade \n\ncertain  branch  of \n\nOne  should  not  be  surprised  that  MOFCOM, \nan  executive  branch  of  the  government,  can  be  the \nauthoritative  decision-maker \nlaw,  nor \nshould one be tempted to think that only the highest \ncourt  or  judicial  authority  of  a  country  is  the \nauthoritative  decision-maker  for  all  matters.  After \nall,  the  power  of  judicial  review  in  the  style  of  the \ncelebrated  Marbury  v.  Madison  case,  1  Cranch  137 \n(1803), is not universal, or not yet, particularly not in \nthe executive-led government systems. In some legal \nsystems,  a \nthe  executive \ngovernment  is  given  the  authority  to  act  as  the \nauthoritative decision-maker in certain areas, whose \ndecisions  may  not  be  directly  invalidated  by  the \njudiciary. One need go no farther to see this than the \nUnited  Kingdom  Human  Rights  Act  of  1998.  Under \nthat act, U.K. courts are directed to interpret laws as \nmuch as possible so as to comply with the European \nConvention  on  Human  Rights—a  sort  of  Charming \nBetsy, 6 Cranch 64 (1804), in operation without such \na designation. But, if such a mode of interpretation is \nnot able to solve all problems, courts are allowed only \nto make a declaration of incompatibility between the \nlaw in issue and the European Convention, and then \nleave  the  matter  to  the  political  branches.  United \nKingdom Human Rights Act of 1998, Sections 3, 4 & \n10.   \n\nSimilarly, \n\nin  China,  courts  undertaking \njudicial  review  under  the  Administrative  Litigation \nAct—with  Chinese  characteristics—of  regulations \nmade by administrative authorities may not directly \n\n \n\f15 \n\ninvalidate  or  vacate  such  regulations  but  may  only \nmake  suggestions  to  the  rule-making  authorities  on \nhow to remedy them, which would leave them in full \nforce,  with  inconveniences,  until  these  authorities \nagree  to  do  so.  This  is  made  clear  recently  by  the \nSupreme People’s Court of China in Article 149 of its \nInterpretive  Directives  on  the  Application  of  the \nAdministrative Litigation Act, adopted on November \n13, 2017.5  \n\nIn any event, if there is an issue as to whether \nthe MOFCOM is the authoritative decision-maker on \ntrade law in China, this issue can be settled through \na proper process in the courts. \n\nFirst  Nat’l  City  Bank  v.

There  is \ngreat  difference  between the  meaning  of foreign law \nand the effect it should be given in the United States. \nHere before this Court is only the question as to how \nto decide what Chinese trade law means or its effect \nin the China. \n\nRejecting binding deference and subjecting the \ninterpretation or characterization of foreign law by a \nforeign  country’s  authoritative  decision-maker  to \n\n5 Available at < http://www.court.gov.cn/fabu-xiangqing-\n80342.html> (last accessed April 3, 2018).  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f16 \n\nreexamination  or \nreinterpretation  by  another \ncountry’s  courts  will  lead  to  chaos  in  international \nrelations,  especially \ninternational  commerce.  As \nhas been pointed out: \n\nHolding that U.S. courts can second guess the \nhighest  administrative  authority  of  a  foreign \nstate  on  interpretations  of  that  state’s  law \nwould  raise  serious  practical  problems.  Most \nobviously,  it  would  create  difficulties  for  the \nregulated  entities,  who  face  the  possibility \nof  being  told  by  a  foreign  regulator  that  they \nmust do x and then being told by a U.S. court \nthat  the  foreign  regulator  misunderstood  its \nown  domestic  law  and  that  they  should  not \nhave done x.6 \n\nAnd  this  problem  can  be  multiplied  many  times, \nperhaps as many as the total number of countries in \nthe world, because other countries are mostly bound \nto  adopt  the  same  approach  either  on  the  basis  of \nreciprocity  or  by  the  persuasion  of  the  high  profile \nand  standing  in  the  world  of  this  Honorable  Court. \nHow  can  business  people  engaged  in  international \ncommerce  order  their  lives  and  production  so  as  to \n\n6   Daniel  A.

Indeed, if chaos is \npreferred  in  some  quarters,  it  is  definitely  to  be \navoided in international commerce. \n\nto \n\nare \n\ncourts \n\nbound \n\naccept \n\nauthoritative \n\nThe  fact  that  in  international  litigation  the \nUnited  States  “historically  has  not  argued  that \nforeign \nits \ncharacterizations  or  precluded  from  considering \nother  relevant  material”,  or  that  “although  other \nnations’ approaches to determining foreign law vary, \nwe  are  not  aware  of  any  foreign-court  decision \nholding  that  representations  by  the  United  States \nare  entitled  to  such  conclusive  weight”,  US  Merits \nBrief  at  29,  should  not  dissuade  US  courts  from \naccording  binding  deference  to  those  by  other \ncountries’ \ndecision-makers.  This \nsituation does not result from other countries’ refusal \nto accord such deference, but from the United States’ \nown  decision  not  to  seek  such  deference.  It  may  be \nthere  just  for  the  asking.  More  importantly,  this \npicture that the Solicitor General has painted is one \nof  the  past  or,  at  best,  the  present;  the  future  may \nhave  in  store  a  different  policy  for  the  policy-\nmakers,  but  courts  cannot  change  course  too  often. \nEven  more  importantly,  Amicus  submits  that  the \nchaos  and \ninefficiency  that  would  result  from \nsubjecting  the  interpretation  or  characterization  of \nU.S.  law  by  its  highest  administrative  authority  in \nthe matter of trade to differing interpretation around \nthe  world—possibly  by  more  than  190  different \nby  not \nall \ncountries, \n\nreciprocate \n\nthey \n\nif \n\n \n\f18 \n\nbinding \n\naccording \nbe \nappreciated  by  that  authority  or  the  U.S.  business \ncommunity, either.  \n\ndeference—would \n\nnot \n\nIn short, the interpretation or characterization \nof  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM  is  that  by  the \nauthoritative  decision-maker  in  this  area  in  China, \nand  the  Pink  precedent  demands  that  binding \ndeference be given to it. \n\nIV.  The  act  of  state  doctrine  as  reflected  in \nSabbatino  also  supports  binding  deference  to \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of \nthe \nChinese  trade \nlaw  by  MOFCOM  as  the \nauthoritative decision-maker in this area \n\nThe act of state doctrine as reflected in Banco \nNacional de Cuba v. Sabbatino, 376 U.S. 398 (1964), \nand others “precludes the courts of this country from \ninquiring  into  the  validity  of  the  public  acts  a \nrecognized foreign sovereign power committed within \nits  own  territory”,  ibid.  at  401.  This  doctrine \nsupports  binding  deference  to  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM \nas the authoritative decision-maker in this area. \n\nIt \n\nis  difficult  to  see  how  anything  less \nthan  binding  deference  to  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  a \nits \nauthoritative  decision-maker  can  be  squared  with \nthe  act  of  state  doctrine.  Precluded  from  inquiring \ninto the validity of the public acts of another country, \n\ncountry’s \n\nlaw  by \n\n \n \n \n\f19 \n\nof \n\nsuch \n\nthe  courts  of  this  country  cannot  examine  the \nor \npropriety \ncharacterization. Reexamining or reinterpreting that \ninterpretation  or  characterization  is  itself  inquiring \ninto  the  validity  of  that  act  of  interpretation  or \ncharacterization. \n\ninterpretation \n\nan \n\nof \n\ncomity \n\nUnderlying  this  doctrine  are  the  “the  highest \nconsiderations \nand \ninternational \nexpediency.  To  permit  the  validity  of the  acts of one \nsovereign  state  to  be  reexamined  and  perhaps \ncondemned  by  the  courts  of  another  would  very \ncertainly  imperil  the  amicable  relations  between \ngovernments  and  vex  the  peace  of  nations.”  Ibid., \n417-18  (internal  quotation  marks  and  citations \nomitted).  Indeed,  interpreting  and  reinterpreting \nanother  country’s  authoritative  decision-maker’s \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  its  own  laws \namounts  to  saying  that  a  foreign  country  does  not \nknow  its own laws  or  does  not  know  the meaning  of \nits  own  laws.  This  would  be  an  affront  to  an \nindependent sovereign state, and is bound to imperil \namicable and friendly relations between countries. In \nthis  case,  interpreting  and  reinterpreting  China’s \ninterpretation  or \nauthoritative  decision-maker’s \ncharacterization of its trade laws will no doubt cause \nan uproar in China, and adversely affect the already \ntense relations between the two countries. \n\nUnderpinning the act of state doctrine are also \nthe  constitutional  considerations  derived  from  the \nseparation  of  powers  in  the  United  States,  which \nrequire  the  avoidance  of  conflicts  between  the \n\n \n \n \n\f20 \n\njudicial  branch  and  the  executive  branch  of  the \ngovernment in the area of international relations. As \nthe Court put it so well, \n\nthe \n\nthe  basic \n[The  doctrine]  arises  out  of \nrelationships between branches of government \nin  a  system  of  separation  of  powers.  It \nconcerns \nof  dissimilar \ncompetency \ninstitutions to make and implement particular \nkinds  of  decisions  in  the  area  of  international \nrelations.  The  doctrine  as  formulated  in  past \ndecisions  expresses  the  strong  sense  of  the \nJudicial  Branch  that  its  engagement  in  the \ntask  of  passing  on  the  validity  of  foreign  acts \nof  state  may  hinder  rather  than  further  this \ncountry’s pursuit of goals both for itself and for \nthe  community  of  nations  as  a  whole  in  the \ninternational sphere. \n\nvery \n\nconflict \n\nbetween \n\ncase.  A \n\nIbid.,  at  423.  These  concerns  are  on  full  display  in \nthe \nthis \nexecutive  branch  and  the  District  Court  below \nalready  has  or  at  least  is  rearing  its  head.  As \nRespondents show (Respondents’ Merits Brief, at 42-\n44),  the  executive  branch  of  the  United  States \nalready successfully argued at the WTO on the price- \nfixing  system  as  mandated  by  the  MOFCOM,  with \nthe  same  legal  framework  applying  to  different \ncommodities  there,  contrary  to  which  position  the \nDistrict Court below spoke. Even if one were to work \na  hairsplitting  distinction  between  the  different \n\n \n \n \n\f21 \n\ncommodities  or  a  minor  difference  in  use  of  terms \n(required  by  vs.  attributable  to  China)  in  issue  (as \nthe  United  States  argues,  US  Merits  Brief,  at  31  & \nn.7),  the  same legal  framework at  work  there  would \nensure  a  conflict  will  come  to  a  head  in  due  course. \nSuch potential of a conflict obviously is also what the \nact of state doctrine is designed to prevent. \n\nIn  short,  the  act  of  state  doctrine  as  reflected \nin  Sabbatino  also  supports  binding  deference  to  the \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw  by  MOFCOM  as  the  authoritative  decision-\nmaker in this area. \n\nsubsidiarily, \n\nthe \nand \nV.  Alternatively \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese \ntrade \nthe  highest \nadministrative authority on trade law in China \nshould  be \nsubstantial  deference \nanalogous to Chevron deference \n\nlaw  by  MOFCOM  as \n\ngiven \n\nOne  of  the  most  prominent \n\nfeatures  of \ncontemporary life under administrative regulation is \nthe celebrated Chevron deference enunciated by this \nHonorable  Court  in  Chevron,  U.S.A.,  Inc.  v. Natural \nResources Defense Council, Inc., 467 U.S. 837 (1984). \nThere, the Court addressed the weight to be given to \nthe  interpretation  of  a  statutory  provision  by  an \nadministrative agency receiving certain delegation of \nthe legislature. The Court held that “if the statute is \nsilent or ambiguous with respect to the specific issue, \n\n \n \n \n \n\f22 \n\nthe  question  for  the  court  is  whether  the  agency’s \nanswer is based on a permissible construction of the \nstatute”,  ibid.,  at  843.  Or,  as  the  Court  observed, \n“Sometimes  the  legislative  delegation  to  an  agency \non  a  particular  question  is  implicit  rather  than \nexplicit. In such a case, a court may not substitute its \nown  construction  of  a  statutory  provision  for  a \nreasonable interpretation made by the administrator \nof an agency.” Ibid., at 844. \n\nthe  authoritative  decision-maker \n\nAmicus  submits  that,  if  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization  of  Chinese  trade  law  by  MOFCOM \nis  not \nas \ngiven  binding  deference,  it  should  be,  alternatively \nand  subsidiarily,  recognized  as  the  interpretation  or \ncharacterization of Chinese trade law by the highest \nin  China  and  given \nadministrative  authority \nsubstantial \nto  Chevron \ndeference.  Given  such  deference,  as  long  as  it  is \nreasonable  or  permissible  under  Chinese  law,  the \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw by MOFCOM must be respected. \n\nanalogous \n\ndeference \n\nit \n\ninternational \n\nSome have noted that the “domestic origins” of \nfor \ninappropriate \nChevron  deference  render \nrelations.  Amicus \nto \napplication \nrespectfully  disagrees.  Such  “origins”  considerations \ndo not distract from the propriety of its application to \na  wider  area,  just  like  where  a  hero  comes  does  not \ndistract from his or her prowess. What matters most \nis  whether  the  interpretation  or  characterization  of \ntrade law by MOFCOM is so similar, or so analogous \nto the interpretation by U.S. administrative agencies \n\n \n \n \n\f23 \n\naccorded  Chevron  deference  as  to  trigger  the \napplication  of  the  “like  cases  must  be  treated  alike” \nprinciple,  thus  the  application  of  the  Chevron \nprecedent.  Indeed,  the  two  situations  are  so  similar \nand  so  analogous  that  they  cry  out  for  the  same \ntreatment.  As  the  highest  administrative  authority \nin  the  area  of  trade  regulation,  MOFCOM  does—or \ndid  in  the  relevant  time  period—receive  delegation \nfrom  the  legislature  to  regulate  trade  matters  in \nChina, and its authority in this area is near plenary. \nIf  any  doubt  on  this  point  is  entertained,  it  can  be \nsettled through a proper process, just as the issue as \nto  whether  MOFCOM  is  the  authoritative  decision-\nmaker on trade law issues in China. \n\nBorn  of  international  comity  and  respect  for \nindependent  sovereign  states,  the  equal  treatment \naccorded to both the Federal Government and foreign \ngovernments  in  the  federal  courts  in  the  area  of \nforeign  relations  such  as  sovereign  immunities7 also \ncounsels  equal  treatment  for  the  administrative \nagencies  of both  the  U.S.  and  a  foreign  government. \nIndeed,  it  has  already  been  recognized  by  the  Court \nof Appeals in In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz Off \nthe  Coast  of  France,  954  F.2d  1279,  1312  (7th  Cir. \n\n7     See,  e.g.,  Restatement,  Third,  Foreign  Relations  Law  of  the \nUnited  States,  §  454  cmt.  d  (“as  in  regard  to  responsibility  for \nactions  of  officials  and  employees,  the  .  .  .

We  all  know \nthat  business  people  like  uniform  application  of  the \nlaw  as  well  as  efficiency,  on  which  their  livelihood \ndepends.  The  unique  way  Chevron  deference \npromotes uniform application of law and efficiency by \nplacing the agency as the prime actor in a particular \nspace  has  been  appreciated  in  the  literature. 8 \nThat  beauty  knows  no  geographical  limitations  or \nnational boundaries.  \nFinally, \n\nthe \ninterpretation  or  characterization  of  Chinese  trade \nlaw by MOFCOM no doubt meets the “reasonable” or \n“permissible”  standard,  and  the  District  Court \nshould not have substituted its “better” view for that \nof the MOFCOM.  \n\nsubmits \n\nAmicus \n\nthat \n\n8   Peter  L.

Respondents  have  clearly  demonstrated  that \nthere is no such inconsistency. Brief for Respondents \n40-41. Nothing more can be added in this regard.  \n\nHowever, it is respectfully submitted that such \ninconsistency, even assumed to exist, does not affect \nthe  validity  of  China’s  position  in  this  case  as  a \nmatter  of  domestic  law  and  therefore  the  binding \ndeference  due  to  it.  This  point  is  illustrated  to  the \nfull by this Court in Medellín v. Texas, 552 U.S. 491 \n(2008),  a  case  on  the  death  penalty,  a  matter  of \nconsiderably greater moment than the price-fixing at \nissue \nin  this  case.  There  the  Court  made  a \ndistinction  between  international  obligation  and \ndomestic  obligation,  ibid.  at  520,  and  between  the \nU.S.  President’s  international  representation  and \ninternational responsibility, on the one hand, and his \nunilateral  authority  to  create  domestic  law,  on  the \nother, ibid., 529. Regarding application in the United \nStates,  the  domestic authority  prevails.
