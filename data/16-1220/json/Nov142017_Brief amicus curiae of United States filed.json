        "In the Supreme Court of the United States \n\nANIMAL SCIENCE PRODUCTS, INC., ET AL., PETITIONERS \n\nNo. 16-1220 \n\nHEBEI WELCOME PHARMACEUTICAL CO. LTD., ET AL. \n\nv. \n\nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI  \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE \n\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n\nThis brief is submitted in response to the Court’s or-\nder  inviting  the  Solicitor  General to  express  the  views \nof the United States.  In the view of the United States, \nthe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be granted, \nlimited to the second question presented.  \n\nSTATEMENT \n\n1.  Petitioners are U.S. purchasers of vitamin C.  Re-\nspondents are Chinese manufacturers and exporters of \nvitamin C.  In 2005, petitioners filed suits alleging that \nrespondents had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, \n15 U.S.C. 1, by fixing the prices and quantities of vita-\nmin  C  exported  to  the  United  States.    Petitioners  al-\nleged  that  the  conspiracy  was  accomplished  through  a \nmembership  entity  known  as  the  China  Chamber  of \nCommerce  of  Medicines  and  Health  Products  Import-\ners and Exporters (Chamber).  Pet. App. 2a, 4a-5a. \n\n(1)",
        "2 \n\na.  Respondents  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaints.  \nThey  did  not  deny  that  they  had  fixed  the  prices  and \nquantities of vitamin C exports.  Instead, they asserted \nthat  their  actions  had  been  required  by  Chinese  law, \nand  that  petitioners’  claims  were  therefore  barred  by \nthe act of state doctrine, the foreign sovereign compul-\nsion  doctrine,  and  principles  of  international  comity.  \nPet. App. 6a.  The Ministry of Commerce of the People’s \nRepublic of China (Ministry) filed an amicus brief sup-\nporting  respondents.    Ibid.;  see  id.  at  189a-223a.    The \nMinistry  represented  that  it  was  the  authority  within \nthe Chinese government responsible for regulating for-\neign  trade,  id.  at  190a;  that  the  Chamber  was  a  state-\nsupervised entity authorized to regulate vitamin C ex-\nports, id.  at  201a;  and  that  the  alleged  conspiracy had \nbeen “a regulatory pricing regime mandated by the gov-\nernment of China,” id. at 197a. \n\nPetitioners  disputed  that  account  of  Chinese  law.  \nThey noted, for example, that the Chamber had publicly \ndescribed  the  agreement  on  vitamin  C  prices  and  \nquantities  as  a  “self-regulated  agreement”  that  was \nadopted “voluntarily” and “without any government in-\ntervention.”    Pet.  App.  173a-174a  (emphases  and  cita-\ntion  omitted).    Petitioners  also  submitted  evidence  ac-\nquired  through  limited  discovery,  which  in  their  view \nshowed that respondents had “voluntarily restricted ex-\nport volume and fixed prices.”  Id. at 175a. \n\nThe district court denied respondents’ motion to dis-\nmiss.  Pet. App. 157a-188a.  The court held that the Min-\nistry’s description of Chinese law was “entitled to sub-\nstantial  deference,”  but  it  declined  to  treat  the  Minis-\ntry’s  brief  as  “conclusive,”  in  part  because  “the  plain \nlanguage  of  the  documentary  evidence  submitted  by \n[petitioners] contradict[ed] the Ministry’s position.”  Id.",
        "3 \n\nat  181a; see id.  at  179a.   The court  concluded  that the \nrecord was “too ambiguous to foreclose further inquiry \ninto the voluntariness of [respondents’] actions.”  Id. at \n186a.  \n\nb.  After  further  discovery,  respondents  moved  for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Ministry sub-\nmitted a statement reiterating its position that Chinese \nlaw  had  compelled  respondents’  conduct.    Id.  at  97a \nn.24.    Petitioners cited  additional  evidence  supporting \ntheir  contrary  view,  including  documents  in  which \nChina  had  represented  to  the  World  Trade  Organiza-\ntion (WTO) that it “gave up export administration of  . . .  \nvitamin C” in 2002.  Id. at 74a (citation omitted).   \n\nThe  district  court  denied  respondents’  motion  for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 54a-156a.  The court con-\ncluded that, although a foreign government’s character-\nization of its law warrants deference, it is not “entitled \nto absolute and conclusive deference.”  Id. at 97a.  Here, \nthe court “respectfully decline[d] to defer to the Minis-\ntry’s interpretation.”  Id. at 117a.  The court explained \nthat the Ministry’s submissions had “fail[ed] to address \ncritical provisions of the [governing legal regime] that, \non their face, undermine its interpretation.”  Id. at 119a; \nsee id. at 97a & n.24.  The court also noted that the Min-\nistry’s most recent statement did not cite legal authori-\nties  “to  support  its  broad  assertions”  and  read  like  a \n“carefully  crafted  and  phrased  litigation  position”  ra-\nther  than  a  “straightforward  explanation  of  Chinese \nlaw.”   Id.  at  120a.   And  the  court emphasized  that  the \nMinistry had “ma[de] no attempt to explain China’s rep-\nresentations [to the WTO] that it gave up export admin-\nistration of vitamin C.”  Id. at 121a.",
        "4 \n\nThe district court then held that Chinese law did not \nrequire respondents to fix the price and quantity of vit-\namin  C  exports.    Pet.  App.  122a-155a.    Inter  alia,  the \ncourt concluded that exporters had the authority to sus-\npend the legal regime that assertedly required them to \nadhere  to  agreed-upon  prices.    Id.  at  123a-125a.    The \ncourt also concluded that, even if Chinese law required \nrespondents to agree on and adhere to minimum prices, \nit did not compel their agreement to limit quantities.  Id. \nat 126a-127a.  The court stated that the factual record \nreinforced its understanding, because there was no evi-\ndence  that  Chinese  exporters  had  faced  penalties  for \nfailing to adhere to agreed-upon quantities or for “fail-\ning  to  reach  agreements  in  the  first  instance.”    Id.  at \n151a; see id. at 149a-151a. \n\nc.  The case was tried to a jury, which found that re-\nspondents  had  conspired  to  fix  the  price  and  limit  the \noutput  of  vitamin  C.    The  district  court  entered  judg-\nment for petitioners, awarding $147 million in damages \nand  permanently  enjoining  respondents  from  further \nviolations of the Sherman Act.  Pet. App. 11a. \n\n2.  The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-38a.  \nThe court held that “the district court erred in denying \n[respondents’] motion to dismiss” based on comity, and \nit therefore declined to “address the subsequent stages \nof th[e] litigation.”  Id. at 2a & n.2. \n\nThe court of appeals explained that, “[t]o determine \nwhether to abstain from asserting jurisdiction on comity \ngrounds,” a court hearing a Sherman Act suit should ap-\nply a “multi-factor balancing test” drawn from Timber-\nlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597 (9th \nCir. 1976) (Timberlane), and Mannington Mills, Inc. v. \nCongoleum  Corp.,  595  F.2d  1287  (3d  Cir.  1979).    Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a.  In this case, the court focused primarily",
        "5 \n\non the first factor, which asks whether there was a “true \nconflict” between U.S. and Chinese law.  Id. at 18a. \n\nThe court of appeals concluded that the existence of \na true conflict “hinges on the amount of deference” that \nis  owed  to  the  Ministry’s  characterization  of  Chinese \nlaw.  Pet. App. 20a.  The court acknowledged that there \nis  “competing  authority”  on  that  question,  and  that \nsome  courts  have  declined  to  “accept  such  statements \nas conclusive.”  Id. at 20a-21a.  But the court held that, \nwhen a foreign sovereign “directly participates in U.S. \ncourt proceedings” and offers an interpretation that is \n“reasonable under the circumstances,” “a U.S. court is \nbound to defer.”  Id. at 25a.  The court then held, based \non  the  Ministry’s  submissions,  that  “Chinese  law  re-\nquired  [respondents]  to  engage  in  activities  in  China \nthat constituted antitrust violations here in the United \nStates.”  Ibid.  The court limited itself to the analysis in \nthe Ministry’s brief and did not consider the apparently \ncontradictory  statements  or  other  evidence  identified \nby the district court.  Id. at 27a-33a. \n\nHaving  found  a  true  conflict,  the  court  of  appeals \nstated that the remaining comity factors “clearly weigh \nin favor of U.S. courts abstaining from asserting juris-\ndiction.”  Pet. App. 33a.  Inter alia, the court noted that \nrespondents are Chinese companies, that their conduct \nhad occurred in China, and that (according to the Min-\nistry) this suit had “negatively affected U.S.-China re-\nlations.”  Id. at 34a-35. \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be \ngranted, limited to the second question presented.  That \nquestion  seeks  review  of  the  court  of  appeals’  holding \nthat  the  Ministry’s  brief  conclusively  established  the \ncontent of Chinese law during the prior  period of time",
        "6 \n\nthat is at issue in this case.  A federal court determining \nforeign law should give substantial weight to a foreign \ngovernment’s characterization of its own law.  But a sub-\nmission from a foreign government need not be treated \nas  conclusive  in  all  circumstances,  and  it  does  not  pre-\nclude  the  court  from  considering  other  relevant  mate-\nrial.    The  court  of  appeals’  contrary  holding  warrants \nfurther review because it departs from the decisions of \nother circuits on an important question of federal law. \n\nPetitioners  also  contend  that  the  court  of  appeals \nerred by reviewing the denial of respondents’ motion to \ndismiss,  and  that  courts  may  never  dismiss  Sherman \nAct claims based on considerations of comity.  Those ad-\nditional  questions  do  not  warrant  this  Court’s  review.  \nThey  do  not  implicate  any  conflict  among  the  circuits, \nand they were neither briefed below nor expressly ad-\ndressed by the court of appeals. \n\nI.  THIS  COURT  SHOULD  REVIEW  THE  COURT  OF  \nAPPEALS’ HOLDING THAT THE MINISTRY’S AMICUS \nBRIEF  CONCLUSIVELY  ESTABLISHED  THE  CON-\nTENT OF CHINESE LAW \n\nA.  A Foreign Government’s Characterization Of Its Own \nLaw  Is  Entitled  To  Substantial  Weight,  But  It  Is  Not \nConclusive  \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 was adopted in \n1966 to establish an “effective procedure for raising and \ndetermining  an  issue  concerning  the  law  of  a  foreign \ncountry.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1  advisory  committee’s \nnote (1966) (Adoption).  The rule states that the deter-\nmination  of  foreign  law  is  a  “question  of  law”  for  the \ncourt rather than a question of fact  for the jury.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 44.1.  It further provides that, “[i]n determin-\ning  foreign  law,  the  court  may  consider  any  relevant",
        "7 \n\nmaterial or source, including testimony, whether or not \nsubmitted by  a party or  admissible  under the  Federal \nRules  of  Evidence.”    Ibid.;  see  Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  26.1 \n(similar).   \n\nRule 44.1 reflects a judgment that courts should have \n“maximum  flexibility  about  the  material  to  be  consid-\nered and the methodology to be employed in determin-\ning foreign law in a particular case.”  9A Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure  §  2444,  at  349  (3d  ed.  2008).    Courts  rely  on  a \nvariety  of  materials,  including  “[s]tatutes,  administra-\ntive  material,  and  judicial  decisions”;  “expert  testi-\nmony”  interpreting  those  primary  sources;  and  “any \nother  information”  that  may  be  probative.    Id.  at  342-\n343;  see,  e.g.,  Bodum  USA,  Inc.  v.  La  Cafetiere,  Inc., \n621 F.3d 624, 628 (7th Cir. 2010). \n\nFederal courts considering questions of foreign law \nare sometimes presented with the views of the relevant \nforeign government.  The foreign government may be a \nparty to the suit, see, e.g., In re Oil Spill by the Amoco \nCadiz, 954 F.2d 1279, 1312 (7th Cir. 1992) (Amoco Ca-\ndiz), or (as in this case) it may express its views through \nan  amicus brief  or similar  submission, Pet.  App.  189a-\n223a; see, e.g., United States v. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228, \n1239-1240 & n.23 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. \n1177  (2004).    A  federal  court  determining  foreign  law \nmay also consider views that the relevant foreign gov-\nernment has expressed in another context.  See, e.g., Ac-\ncess  Telecom,  Inc.  v.  MCI  Telecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d \n694,  714  (5th  Cir.  1999),  cert.  denied,  531  U.S.  917 \n(2000).  \n\nA federal court should afford substantial weight to a \nforeign  government’s  characterization  of  its  own  law.  \nThat weight reflects “the spirit of cooperation in which",
        "8 \n\na domestic tribunal approaches the resolution of cases \ntouching  the  laws  and  interests  of  other  sovereign \nstates.”  Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v. \nUnited States Dist. Court, 482 U.S. 522, 543 n.27 (1987).  \nIt also makes practical sense.  “Among the most logical \nsources  for  [a]  court  to  look  to  in  its  determination  of \nforeign law are the [relevant] foreign officials,” who are \nfamiliar with the context and the nuances of the foreign \nlegal system.  McNab, 331 F.3d at 1241. \n\nFederal  courts should  not, however,  treat  a foreign \ngovernment’s characterizations as conclusive in all cir-\ncumstances.  When “a foreign government changes its \noriginal position” or otherwise makes conflicting state-\nments,  a  court  is  not  bound  to  accept  its  most  recent \nstatement, or the one offered in litigation.  McNab, 331 \nF.3d at 1241.  A court likewise need not credit a state-\nment that is unclear or unsupported, or that fails to ad-\ndress relevant authorities.  See, e.g., McKesson HBOC, \nInc.  v.  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  271  F.3d  1101,  1108-\n1109 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (McKesson), cert. denied, 537 U.S. \n941 (2002), vacated in part on other grounds, 320 F.3d \n280 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  The precise weight to be given to \na  foreign  government’s  statement  turns  on  factors  in-\ncluding the statement’s clarity, thoroughness, and sup-\nport; its context and purpose; the authority of the entity \nmaking it; its consistency with past statements; and any \nother corroborating or contradictory evidence.1 \n\n1   In  Matsushita  Electric  Industrial  Co.  v.  Zenith  Radio  Corp., \n475  U.S.  574  (1986)  (Matsushita),  the  United  States  suggested  a \nmore deferential approach, arguing that when a foreign government \nsubmits a statement characterizing its own law, federal courts “gen-\nerally” must “accept that statement at face value.”  U.S. Amicus Br. \nat 23, Matsushita, supra (No. 83-2004).  But the Matsushita brief \nclarified that courts are not bound to accept “[p]lainly ambiguous or",
        "9 \n\nB.  The Court Of Appeals Erred By Treating The Ministry’s \nAmicus  Brief  As  Conclusive  And  Disregarding  Other \nRelevant Materials \n\n1.  The court of appeals held that, when a foreign gov-\nernment  “directly  participates  in  U.S.  court  proceed-\nings” and offers a characterization of its law that is “rea-\nsonable under the circumstances,” the court “is bound to \ndefer.”  Pet. App. 25a.  That formulation would not nec-\nessarily be problematic if the qualifier “reasonable un-\nder the circumstances” allowed a court to assess the rea-\nsonableness  of  the  foreign  government’s  statements  \nin  light  of  all  relevant  circumstances.    The  totality  of  \nthe  court  of  appeals’  opinion,  however,  indicates  that  \nit adopted and applied a far more deferential standard, \nunder  which  a  court  is  bound  to  accept  a  foreign  \ngovernment’s  characterization—and  may  not  consider \nother material—unless that characterization is facially  \nunreasonable.   \n\nThus,  the  court  of  appeals disagreed  with  decisions \nholding  that  U.S.  courts  need  not  treat  a  foreign  gov-\nernment’s  characterization  as  “conclusive.”    Pet.  App. \n21a.  The court also stated that, if deference “is to mean \nanything, it must mean that a U.S. court not embark on \na challenge to a foreign government’s official represen-\ntation.”  Id. at 25a-26a.  Most importantly, in concluding \n\ninternally  inconsistent  statements,”  and  it  added  that  courts  may \nlook behind a foreign government’s statement in “extraordinary cir-\ncumstances.”    Ibid.    More  recently,  in  McNab,  the  United  States \nendorsed  what  had  by  then  become  the  courts  of  appeals’  general \npractice  of  affording  “substantial—but  measured—deference  to  a \nforeign nation’s representations.”  U.S. Br. in Opp. at 16-17, McNab \nv. United States, 540 U.S. 1177 (2004) (No. 03-622).  That more nu-\nanced approach is consistent with the position advocated here.  To \nthe extent the Matsushita brief suggested a different standard, it \nno longer reflects the views of the United States.",
        "10 \n\nthat the Ministry’s brief was a “reasonable” characteri-\nzation  warranting  deference, id.  at  27a,  the  court  lim-\nited its inquiry to the four corners of the brief and the \nsources cited therein, id. at 27a-29a. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  thus  did  not  acknowledge  the \nChamber’s public statement that respondents had “vol-\nuntarily” agreed on prices and quantities “without any \ngovernment  intervention.”    Pet.  App.  173a-174a  (em-\nphases and citation omitted).  It also did not address the \ndistrict  court’s  conclusion  that  the  Ministry’s  submis-\nsions “fail[ed] to address key provisions” of the govern-\ning legal regime.  Id. at 119a; see id. at 97a & n.24.  And \nbecause the court concluded that the Ministry’s amicus \nbrief  precluded  consideration  of  other  material,  it  did \nnot  address  the  more  extensive  record  developed  at \nsummary  judgment,  including,  in  particular,  China’s \nrepresentation  to  the  WTO  that  it  had  “g[i]ve[n]  up  \nexport  administration  of    . . .    vitamin  C.”    Id.  at  74a  \n(citation  omitted).    Those  circumstances  are,  at  mini-\nmum,  relevant  to  the  weight  that  the  Ministry’s  brief \nshould  receive.    A  standard  that  does  not  permit  a  \ncourt even to consider such information is inconsistent \nwith federal courts’ responsibility to “determin[e] foreign \nlaw” based on “any relevant material or source.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 44.1. \n\n2.  The  court  of  appeals  believed  that  its  rigid  ap-\nproach was compelled by United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. \n203 (1942).  Pet. App. 20a, 22a-23a.  In Pink, which pre-\nceded the adoption of Rule 44.1, the United States had \nobtained an “official declaration by the Commissariat of \nJustice”  of  the  Soviet  Union  defining  the  extraterrito-\nrial  reach  of  a  Russian  decree.    315  U.S.  at  218.    The \nCourt concluded that, because “the evidence supported \n[a]  finding”  that  “the  Commissariat  for  Justice  ha[d]",
        "11 \n\npower  to  interpret  existing  Russian  law,”  the  “official \ndeclaration [wa]s  conclusive so  far  as the intended  ex-\ntraterritorial  effect  of  the  Russian  decree  [wa]s  con-\ncerned.”  Id. at 220. \n\nBecause the Commissariat was empowered to render \nan authoritative construction of Russian law, the official \ndeclaration in Pink was in some respects analogous to a \nstate supreme court’s answer to a question of state law \ncertified by a federal court.  Cf. United States v. Juve-\nnile Male, 560 U.S. 558, 561 (2010) (per curiam).  There \nwas  also  apparently  no  indication  that  the  declaration \nwas incomplete or inconsistent with the Soviet Union’s \npast statements on the question.  This Court’s holding \nthat  the  Commissariat’s  declaration  was  “conclusive” \nunder those circumstances does not suggest that every \nsubmission  by  a  foreign  government  is  entitled  to  the \nsame weight. \n\n3.  The court of appeals also reasoned that a foreign \ngovernment’s characterization of its own laws should be \nafforded  “the  same  respect  and  treatment  that  we \nwould expect our government to receive in comparable \nmatters.”  Pet. App. 26a.  That concern for reciprocity \nis sound, but it does not support the court’s conclusion.  \nWhen the Department of Justice litigates questions of \nU.S.  law  in  foreign  tribunals,  it  expects  that  its  views \nwill be afforded substantial weight, and that its charac-\nterizations of U.S. law will be accepted because they are \naccurate and well-supported.  But the Department his-\ntorically  has not  argued that  foreign courts  are  bound \nto  accept  its  characterizations  or  precluded  from  con-\nsidering other relevant material.  And the Department \nis not aware of any foreign-court decision holding that",
        "12 \n\nthe  Department’s  representations  are  entitled  to such \nconclusive weight. 2 \n\nC.  The Court Of Appeals’ Error Warrants Further Review \nThe degree of deference that a court owes to a for-\neign government’s characterization of its own law is an \nimportant  and  recurring  question,  and  foreign  sover-\neigns considering making their views known to federal \ncourts should understand the standards that will be ap-\nplied to their submissions.  The court of appeals’ deci-\nsion  warrants  further  review  because  it  departs  from \nthe  decisions  of  other  circuits  and  creates  uncertainty \nabout  the  proper  treatment  of  foreign  governments’ \ncharacterizations of their laws. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  acknowledged  that  there  is \n“competing authority” on the question presented, and it \nexpressly disagreed with the Seventh Circuit’s decision \nin Amoco  Cadiz.  Pet.  App.  20a-21a.   Respondents  ob-\nserve (Br. in Opp. 23-24) that the court in Amoco Cadiz \nultimately  adopted  the  French government’s  interpre-\ntation  of  French  law.   The  court  did  so,  however,  only \nbecause  it  found  that  interpretation  “plausible”  based \n\n2   The  understanding  that  a  government’s  expressed  view  of  its \nown law is entitled to substantial but not conclusive weight is con-\nsistent with two international treaties that establish mechanisms by \nwhich one state may obtain from another an official statement char-\nacterizing  its  laws.    Those  treaties  specify  that  “[t]he  information \ngiven  in  reply shall  not  bind  the  judicial  authority  from  which the \nrequest emanated.”  European Convention on Information on For-\neign Law art. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 154; see Organization of \nAmerican States, Inter-American Convention on Proof of and Infor-\nmation on Foreign Law art. 6, May 8, 1979, O.A.S.T.S. No. 53, 1439 \nU.N.T.S. 111 (similar).  Although the United States is not a party to \nthose treaties, they further confirm that the court of appeals’ rule is \nout of step with international practice.",
        "13 \n\non  all  of  the  circumstances,  including  the  French  gov-\nernment’s  statements  in  other  contexts.    954  F.2d  at \n1312.  The Seventh Circuit did not treat the French gov-\nernment’s submission as conclusive.   \n\nOther  courts  of  appeals  have  rejected  foreign  gov-\nernments’  characterizations  of  their  own  laws  even \nwhere,  as  here,  those  governments  appeared  in  U.S. \ncourt.  In McNab, for example, the Eleventh Circuit de-\nclined  to  accept  “the  Honduran  government’s  current \ninterpretation  of  its  laws,”  as  reflected  in  an  amicus \nbrief, because that interpretation was inconsistent with \nearlier  statements  by  Honduran  officials.    331  F.3d  at \n1242.    And  in  McKesson,  the  D.C.  Circuit  rejected \n“Iran’s contention that its corporate law requires share-\nholders  * * *  to physically appear at a company’s office  \n* * *  in  order  to collect  dividends.”   271  F.3d  at  1108.  \nThe D.C. Circuit declined to adopt that construction be-\ncause it was not supported by the affidavits submitted \nby Iran’s experts.  Id. at 1108-1109.  The approach re-\nflected in those decisions is consistent with the role of \nfederal  courts  under  Rule  44.1,  and  inconsistent  with \nthe rule of conclusive deference that the Second Circuit \napplied in this case.   \n\nII.  THIS COURT SHOULD DENY REVIEW OF PETITION-\nERS’  CONTENTION  THAT  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS \nERRED BY REVIEWING THE DENIAL OF RESPOND-\nENTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 19-22) that the court of ap-\npeals erred by reviewing the denial of respondents’ mo-\ntion to dismiss in an appeal from a judgment following \na  trial  on  the  merits.    Petitioners  are  correct  that  the \ndenial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  was  effectively  super-\nseded when the district court revisited the comity issue \nlater  in  the  litigation.    But  the  comity  question  was",
        "14 \n\nproperly  before  the  court  of  appeals,  and  the  court’s  \nunexplained decision to focus on the motion to dismiss \ndoes not appear to have affected its ultimate conclusion.  \nThat decision thus does not warrant this Court’s review, \nparticularly because the issue was not briefed below or \nexpressly addressed by the court of appeals. \n\nA. “The general rule is that ‘a party is entitled to a \nsingle  appeal,  to  be  deferred  until  final  judgment  has \nbeen  entered,  in  which  claims  of  district  court  error  \nat  any  stage  of  the  litigation  may  be  ventilated.’ ”  \nQuackenbush  v.  Allstate  Ins.  Co.,  517  U.S.  706,  712 \n(1996)  (citation  omitted).    Accordingly,  although  most \ninterlocutory orders are not themselves appealable, an \n“appeal  from  [a]  final  judgment  opens  the  record  and \npermits  review  of  all  rulings  that  led  up  to  the  judg-\nment.”  15A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure § 3905.1, at 250 (2d ed. 1992). \n\nIn  some  circumstances,  however,  an  interlocutory \norder is effectively superseded by subsequent develop-\nments in the district court.  In Ortiz v. Jordan, 562 U.S. \n180 (2011), for example, this Court held that a court of \nappeals  generally  may  not  review  “an  order  denying \nsummary judgment after a full trial on the merits” be-\ncause “the full record developed [at trial] supersedes the \nrecord  existing  at  the  time  of  the  summary-judgment \nmotion.”  Id. at 184.  A defendant is still free to challenge \nthe sufficiency of the plaintiff ’s proof, but that challenge \n“must be evaluated in light of the character and quality \nof the evidence received in court.”  Ibid. \n\nIn this case, respondents raised their comity defense \nin a motion to dismiss, a motion for summary judgment, \nand  a  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  under \nRule 50(b).  Pet. App. 41a & n.3.  Each time, the district \ncourt  rejected  that  defense  based  on  a  progressively",
        "15 \n\nmore developed record.  Under the circumstances, the \ncourt of appeals erred in focusing on the “denial of [re-\nspondents’] motion to dismiss” and ignoring “the subse-\nquent stages of th[e] litigation.”  Id. at 2a n.2.  The dis-\ntrict court ultimately decided the comity question based \non  a  more  complete  record,  which  “supersede[d]  the \nrecord existing at the time of the [motion to dismiss].”  \nOrtiz, 562 U.S. at 184.   \n\nB. Although  it  was  erroneous,  the  court  of  appeals’ \nfocus on the motion to dismiss does not appear to have \naffected the outcome below and would not likely affect \nany proceedings  on  remand.    Because  the  court incor-\nrectly  believed  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  had  to  be  ac-\ncepted as conclusive, it declined to consider other mate-\nrial in the motion-to-dismiss record—a conclusion that \nwould have applied equally to the more extensive record \ndeveloped  later.    And  if  this  Court  grants  review  and \nholds that the Ministry’s brief is not entitled to conclu-\nsive  weight,  the  court  of  appeals  can  reconsider  the  \nforeign-law issue on remand in light of all of the perti-\nnent record materials.3 \n\nPetitioners assert (Pet. 22) that the court of appeals’ \nfocus on the motion to dismiss was dispositive because \n“[r]espondents’  failure  to  raise  comity  as  a  defense  in \ntheir  pre-verdict  Rule  50(a)  motion  barred  them  from \nseeking relief on that ground in their post-verdict Rule \n50(b) motion, and on any appeal.”  It is true that, absent \na  Rule  50(b)  motion,  “an  appellate  court  is  ‘powerless’ \nto  review  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  after  trial.”  \n\n3   Indeed, the court of appeals stated that, but for the Ministry’s \nbrief, “the district court’s careful and thorough treatment of the ev-\nidence before it  * * *  at both the motion to dismiss and summary \njudgment stages would have been entirely appropriate.”  Pet. App. \n30a n.10.",
        "16 \n\nOrtiz, 562 U.S. at 189 (citation omitted).  It is also true \nthat “[a] motion under Rule 50(b) is not allowed unless \nthe  movant  sought  relief  on  similar  grounds”  under \nRule 50(a).  Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, \n485 n.5 (2008).  For two reasons, however, those princi-\nples did not preclude the court of appeals from deciding \nthe comity question.  \n\nFirst, comity does not concern “the sufficiency of the \nevidence.”  Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 189.  Both the determina-\ntion of foreign law and the ultimate decision whether to \ndismiss  a  claim  on  comity  grounds  are  made  by  the \ncourt, not the jury.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1; see Pet. App. \n42a.    Indeed,  “given  the  important  role  that  comity \nplays” in protecting interests that transcend the parties \nto a particular case, a court may overlook a party’s fail-\nure to raise the issue.  Gucci Am., Inc. v. Weixing Li, \n768 F.3d 122, 138-140 (2d Cir. 2014).4  \n\nSecond,  petitioners  have  forfeited  their  Rule  50(a) \nargument.  Petitioners did not object when respondents \nraised  comity  in  their  Rule  50(b)  motion.    D.  Ct.  Doc. \n702, at 24-31 (May 10, 2013).  Where, as here, “the non-\nmoving  party  fails  to  object  to  a  Rule  50(b)  motion  on \nthe  grounds  of  waiver,  the  objection  itself  is  deemed \nwaived.”  Gronowski v. Spencer, 424 F.3d 285, 297 (2d \nCir. 2005).  And petitioners forfeited the argument  again \nby failing to raise it on appeal.  Pet. C.A. Br. 44-45.   \n\n4  Contrary to respondents’ suggestion (Br. in Opp. 15), principles \nof international comity do not bear on the court’s subject-matter ju-\nrisdiction.    See  Cooper  v.  Tokyo  Elec.  Power  Co.,  860  F.3d  1193, \n1209-1210 (9th Cir. 2017); cf. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, \n514-516 (2006).  Courts thus have the power, but not a jurisdictional \nobligation, to raise comity sua sponte.",
        "17 \n\nC. The  comity  issue  thus  was  properly  before  the \ncourt of appeals, even though the court erred by focus-\ning on the motion to dismiss rather than on the full rec-\nord.   Petitioners  assert (Pet.  19-20)  that this  aspect  of \nthe court of appeals’ decision conflicts with decisions of \nthe Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits holding that a court \nof appeals may not review the denial of a motion to dis-\nmiss after a trial on the merits.  But those decisions in-\nvolved motions to dismiss for failure to plead facts suf-\nficient  to  state  a  claim,  not  motions  based  on  interna-\ntional comity.  And even if the court of appeals’ decision \ncreated a circuit conflict, this case would not be an ap-\npropriate vehicle in which to resolve it because the issue \nwas  neither  briefed  below  nor  explicitly  addressed  by \nthe court of appeals.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. \n709, 718 n.7 (2005) (“[W]e are a court of review, not of \nfirst view.”). \n\nIII.  PETITIONERS’  CONTENTION  THAT  COURTS  MAY \nNOT  DISMISS  SHERMAN  ACT  CLAIMS  BASED  ON \nINTERNATIONAL  COMITY  DOES  NOT  WARRANT \nTHIS COURT’S REVIEW   \n\nPetitioners contend (Pet. 29-34) that a federal court \nmay never invoke principles of comity to dismiss a Sher-\nman Act claim.  Petitioners did not raise that argument \nbelow, and the court of appeals’ implicit conclusion that \ncomity-based  dismissals  are  sometimes  permissible \ndoes not conflict with any decision of this Court or an-\nother court of appeals.  Further review is not warranted. \nA. This  Court has  long  held  that  “the  Sherman  Act \napplies  to  foreign  conduct  that  was  meant  to  produce \nand  did  in  fact  produce  some  substantial  effect  in  the \nUnited  States.”    Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  California, \n509 U.S. 764, 796 (1993).  In Section 402 of the Foreign \nTrade  Antitrust  Improvements  Act  of  1982  (FTAIA),",
        "18 \n\nPub. L. No. 97-290, Tit. IV, 96 Stat 1246 (15 U.S.C. 6a), \nCongress  confirmed  that  understanding  and  clarified \nthe application of the Sherman Act to conduct involving \nforeign commerce.  Under the FTAIA, the Sherman Act \ngenerally does not reach “commercial activities taking \nplace  abroad,  unless  those  activities  adversely  affect \ndomestic commerce” or “imports to the United States.”  \nF. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. \n155, 161 (2004) (Empagran). \n\nComity is often described as “the recognition which \none nation allows within its territory to the legislative, \nexecutive or judicial acts of another nation, having due \nregard both to international duty and convenience, and \nto the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who \nare under the protection of its laws.”  Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 U.S. 113, 164 (1895).  The Sherman Act does not ex-\npressly incorporate principles of comity.  But the comity \ndoctrine  had  already  been  established  when  the  Sher-\nman Act was enacted, see, e.g., id. at 165-166, and it thus \nformed  a  part  of  the  “contemporary  legal  context  in \nwhich Congress acted,” Associated Gen. Contractors of \nCal., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 \nU.S. 519, 532 (1983).  This Court has often looked to that \ncontext  in  “ascertain[ing]  the  intended  scope”  and  ap-\nplication  of  the  Sherman  Act’s  broadly  worded  provi-\nsions.  Ibid.   \n\nConsistent  with  that  understanding,  courts  of  ap-\npeals have long held that courts may, in unusual circum-\nstances,  dismiss  private  Sherman  Act  claims  based  on \nprinciples of comity.  See, e.g., Mannington Mills, Inc. \nv. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1297-1298 (3d Cir. \n1979); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am., 549 F.2d \n597, 613-615 (9th Cir. 1976).  Those courts have consid-\nered a variety of factors, including:",
        "19 \n\n[T]he  degree  of  conflict  with  foreign  law  or  policy, \nthe nationality or allegiance of the parties and the lo-\ncations  or  principal  places  of  business  of  corpora-\ntions,  the  extent  to  which  enforcement  by  either \nstate can be expected to achieve compliance, the rel-\native significance of effects on the United States as \ncompared with those elsewhere, the extent to which \nthere is explicit purpose to harm or affect American \ncommerce, the foreseeability of such effect, and the \nrelative importance to the violations charged of con-\nduct within the United States as compared with con-\nduct abroad. \n\nTimberlane,  549  F.2d  at  614;  see  Mannington  Mills, \n595  F.2d  at  1297-1298  (similar  ten-factor  test).    Con-\ngress  did  not  disturb  those  decisions  when  it  enacted \nthe FTAIA.  To the contrary, the House Report accom-\npanying the FTAIA cited Timberlane and specified that \nthe FTAIA “would have no effect on the courts’ ability \nto employ notions of comity.”  H.R. Rep. No. 686, 97th \nCong., 2d Sess. 13 (1982).    \n  Comity-based  dismissals  should  be  rare,  because \nCongress unambiguously intended the Sherman Act to \nreach foreign conduct and because federal courts “have \nthe power, and ordinarily the obligation, to decide cases \nand  controversies  properly  presented  to  them.”    W.S. \nKirkpatrick  &  Co.  v.  Environmental  Tectonics  Corp., \nInt’l, 493 U.S. 400, 409 (1990).  But in the United States’ \nview,  federal  courts  may,  in  extraordinary  circum-\nstances,  dismiss  private  Sherman  Act  claims  based  on \nprinciples of comity. 5 \n\n5   Although  courts  may  engage  in  a  comity  analysis  in  private \nSherman Act suits, they should not do so in actions brought by fed-\neral agencies.  The government’s decision to bring an enforcement \naction “represents a determination that the importance of antitrust",
        "20 \n\nB. The United States does not endorse all aspects of \nthe court of appeals’ comity analysis.  For example, un-\nder the circumstances presented here, respondents’ ar-\ngument  that  Chinese  law  required  them  to  engage  in \nthe challenged conduct might have been better analyzed \nunder  the  rubric  of  the  foreign  sovereign  compulsion \ndoctrine rather than through a comity analysis.  Cf. U.S. \nDep’t  of  Justice  &  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n,  Antitrust \nGuidelines for International Enforcement and Cooper-\nation § 4.2.2, at 32-34 (2017).  The court also gave inad-\nequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims of the \nalleged  price-fixing  cartel  and  to  the  interests  of  the \nUnited States in enforcement of its antitrust laws.  Pet. \nApp.  34a-35a.    Conversely,  the  court  gave  too  much \nweight to China’s objections to this suit.  Id. at 35a.  Un-\nlike a statement from the Executive Branch, a foreign \nsovereign’s objection to a suit does not, in itself, neces-\nsarily indicate that the case will harm U.S. foreign rela-\ntions.  But petitioners do not seek this Court’s review of \nthe court of appeals’ specific application of comity prin-\nciples;  they  argue  that  the  court  should  not  have  per-\nformed  a  comity  analysis  at  all.    That  aspect  of  the \ncourt’s  decision  does  not  conflict  with  any  decision  of \nthis Court or another court of appeals. \n\n1.  In  Hartford  Fire,  this  Court  declined  to  decide \nwhether a court may dismiss a Sherman Act claim based \non comity.  509 U.S. at 798.  The Court has not explicitly \n\nenforcement outweighs any relevant foreign policy concerns.”  U.S. \nDep’t  of  Justice  &  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n,  Antitrust  Guidelines  for \nInternational  Enforcement  and  Cooperation  §  4.1,  at  28  (2017).  \nGiven the primacy of the Executive Branch in the realm of foreign \npolicy, courts should not “second-guess the executive branch’s judg-\nment as to the proper role of comity concerns” in antitrust enforce-\nment actions.  United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 731 F. Supp. 3, \n6 n.5 (D.D.C. 1990).",
        "21 \n\nrevisited  that  issue  in  the  intervening  years,  but peti-\ntioners assert (Pet. 31-32) that the Court implicitly fore-\nclosed  comity-based  dismissals  in  Empagran.    That  is \nnot  correct.    In  Empagran,  the  Court  considered  the \nFTAIA’s  directive  that  the  Sherman  Act  reaches  con-\nduct involving non-import foreign commerce only if the \nconduct’s  effect  on  U.S.  commerce  “gives  rise  to  a \nclaim” under the Sherman Act.  15 U.S.C. 6a(2); see Em-\npagran,  542 U.S.  at  174.   The  Court  held  that,  when  a \nSherman Act violation “adversely affects both custom-\ners outside the United States and customers within the \nUnited  States,  but  the  adverse  foreign  effect  is  inde-\npendent of any adverse domestic effect,” a plaintiff who \nsuffers only foreign harm may not sue.  542 U.S. at 164.   \nIn reaching that conclusion, this Court rejected the \nplaintiffs’  argument  that  courts  should  deal  with  the \nproblems posed by foreign-injury cases by “abstaining \nwhere  comity  considerations  so  dictate.”    Empagran, \n542 U.S. at 168.  The Court deemed that approach “too \ncomplex,”  and  instead  interpreted  the  FTAIA  to  “ex-\nclude  independent  foreign  injury  cases  across  the \nboard.”  Ibid.  In so holding, however, the Court did not \npurport  to  resolve  the  question  left  open  in  Hartford \nFire or to bar courts from invoking comity principles in \ncases  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  the Sherman  Act  as \nclarified by the FTAIA. \n\n2.  Petitioners  are  also  wrong  in  asserting  (Pet.  32-\n33)  that  other  courts  of  appeals  have  rejected  the  ap-\nproach  to  comity  reflected  in  Timberlane  and  Man-\nnington  Mills.    To  the  contrary,  one  of  the  decisions \nthey  cite  “commend[ed]  the[]  analysis”  in  those  cases \nand agreed that “[a] district court should not apply the \nantitrust  laws  to  foreign  conduct  or  foreign  actors  if",
        "22 \n\nsuch application would violate principles of comity.”  In-\ndustrial Inv. Dev. Corp. v. Mitsui & Co., 671 F.2d 876, \n884 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1982), vacated, 460 U.S. 1007 (1983).  \nThe  remaining  decisions  on  which  petitioners  rely \nsimply  interpreted  the  Sherman  Act’s  extraterritorial \nreach; they did not address any case-specific comity ar-\nguments, much less hold that such arguments are cate-\ngorically foreclosed.  In re Monosodium Glutamate An-\ntitrust Litig., 477 F.3d 535, 538-539 (8th Cir. 2007); Em-\npagran  S.A.  v.  F.  Hoffmann-Laroche  Ltd.,  417  F.3d \n1267, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1092 \n(2006). \n\nC. Even if the comity question otherwise warranted \nthis Court’s review, this case would not be an appropri-\nate  vehicle  in  which  to  consider  it.    As  petitioners \nacknowledge  (Reply  Br.  13),  they  did  not  argue  below \nthat  comity-based  dismissals  are  categorically  imper-\nmissible, and the court of appeals therefore did not con-\nsider  that  argument.    This  Court’s  “traditional  rule  \n* * *    precludes  a  grant  of  certiorari”  where,  as  here, \n“ ‘the  question  presented  was  not  pressed  or  passed \nupon below.’ ”  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, \n41  (1992)  (citation  omitted).  Petitioners  identify  no \nsound reason to depart from that rule here.",

LTD., ET AL. \n\nv. \n\nON PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI  \nTO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS  \nFOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT \n\nBRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES AS AMICUS CURIAE \n\nINTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES \n\nThis brief is submitted in response to the Court’s or-\nder  inviting  the  Solicitor  General to  express  the  views \nof the United States.  In the view of the United States, \nthe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be granted, \nlimited to the second question presented.  \n\nSTATEMENT \n\n1.  Petitioners are U.S. purchasers of vitamin C.  Re-\nspondents are Chinese manufacturers and exporters of \nvitamin C.  In 2005, petitioners filed suits alleging that \nrespondents had violated Section 1 of the Sherman Act, \n15 U.S.C. 1, by fixing the prices and quantities of vita-\nmin  C  exported  to  the  United  States.    Petitioners  al-\nleged  that  the  conspiracy  was  accomplished  through  a \nmembership  entity  known  as  the  China  Chamber  of \nCommerce  of  Medicines  and  Health  Products  Import-\ners and Exporters (Chamber).  Pet. App. 2a, 4a-5a. \n\n(1) \n\n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\na.  Respondents  moved  to  dismiss  the  complaints.  \nThey  did  not  deny  that  they  had  fixed  the  prices  and \nquantities of vitamin C exports.  Instead, they asserted \nthat  their  actions  had  been  required  by  Chinese  law, \nand  that  petitioners’  claims  were  therefore  barred  by \nthe act of state doctrine, the foreign sovereign compul-\nsion  doctrine,  and  principles  of  international  comity.  \nPet. App. 6a.  The Ministry of Commerce of the People’s \nRepublic of China (Ministry) filed an amicus brief sup-\nporting  respondents.    Ibid.;  see  id.  at  189a-223a.    The \nMinistry  represented  that  it  was  the  authority  within \nthe Chinese government responsible for regulating for-\neign  trade,  id.  at  190a;  that  the  Chamber  was  a  state-\nsupervised entity authorized to regulate vitamin C ex-\nports, id.  at  201a;  and  that  the  alleged  conspiracy had \nbeen “a regulatory pricing regime mandated by the gov-\nernment of China,” id. at 197a. \n\nPetitioners  disputed  that  account  of  Chinese  law.  \nThey noted, for example, that the Chamber had publicly \ndescribed  the  agreement  on  vitamin  C  prices  and  \nquantities  as  a  “self-regulated  agreement”  that  was \nadopted “voluntarily” and “without any government in-\ntervention.”    Pet.  App.  173a-174a  (emphases  and  cita-\ntion  omitted).    Petitioners  also  submitted  evidence  ac-\nquired  through  limited  discovery,  which  in  their  view \nshowed that respondents had “voluntarily restricted ex-\nport volume and fixed prices.”  Id. at 175a. \n\nThe district court denied respondents’ motion to dis-\nmiss.  Pet. App. 157a-188a.  The court held that the Min-\nistry’s description of Chinese law was “entitled to sub-\nstantial  deference,”  but  it  declined  to  treat  the  Minis-\ntry’s  brief  as  “conclusive,”  in  part  because  “the  plain \nlanguage  of  the  documentary  evidence  submitted  by \n[petitioners] contradict[ed] the Ministry’s position.”  Id. \n\n \n\f3 \n\nat  181a; see id.  at  179a.   The court  concluded  that the \nrecord was “too ambiguous to foreclose further inquiry \ninto the voluntariness of [respondents’] actions.”  Id. at \n186a.  \n\nb.  After  further  discovery,  respondents  moved  for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 10a.  The Ministry sub-\nmitted a statement reiterating its position that Chinese \nlaw  had  compelled  respondents’  conduct.    Id.  at  97a \nn.24.    Petitioners cited  additional  evidence  supporting \ntheir  contrary  view,  including  documents  in  which \nChina  had  represented  to  the  World  Trade  Organiza-\ntion (WTO) that it “gave up export administration of  . . .  \nvitamin C” in 2002.  Id. at 74a (citation omitted).   \n\nThe  district  court  denied  respondents’  motion  for \nsummary judgment.  Pet. App. 54a-156a.  The court con-\ncluded that, although a foreign government’s character-\nization of its law warrants deference, it is not “entitled \nto absolute and conclusive deference.”  Id. at 97a.  Here, \nthe court “respectfully decline[d] to defer to the Minis-\ntry’s interpretation.”  Id. at 117a.  The court explained \nthat the Ministry’s submissions had “fail[ed] to address \ncritical provisions of the [governing legal regime] that, \non their face, undermine its interpretation.”  Id. at 119a; \nsee id. at 97a & n.24.  The court also noted that the Min-\nistry’s most recent statement did not cite legal authori-\nties  “to  support  its  broad  assertions”  and  read  like  a \n“carefully  crafted  and  phrased  litigation  position”  ra-\nther  than  a  “straightforward  explanation  of  Chinese \nlaw.”   Id.  at  120a.   And  the  court emphasized  that  the \nMinistry had “ma[de] no attempt to explain China’s rep-\nresentations [to the WTO] that it gave up export admin-\nistration of vitamin C.”  Id. at 121a.   \n\n \n\f4 \n\nThe district court then held that Chinese law did not \nrequire respondents to fix the price and quantity of vit-\namin  C  exports.    Pet.  App.  122a-155a.    Inter  alia,  the \ncourt concluded that exporters had the authority to sus-\npend the legal regime that assertedly required them to \nadhere  to  agreed-upon  prices.    Id.  at  123a-125a.    The \ncourt also concluded that, even if Chinese law required \nrespondents to agree on and adhere to minimum prices, \nit did not compel their agreement to limit quantities.  Id. \nat 126a-127a.  The court stated that the factual record \nreinforced its understanding, because there was no evi-\ndence  that  Chinese  exporters  had  faced  penalties  for \nfailing to adhere to agreed-upon quantities or for “fail-\ning  to  reach  agreements  in  the  first  instance.”    Id.  at \n151a; see id. at 149a-151a. \n\nc.  The case was tried to a jury, which found that re-\nspondents  had  conspired  to  fix  the  price  and  limit  the \noutput  of  vitamin  C.    The  district  court  entered  judg-\nment for petitioners, awarding $147 million in damages \nand  permanently  enjoining  respondents  from  further \nviolations of the Sherman Act.  Pet. App. 11a. \n\n2.  The court of appeals reversed.  Pet. App. 1a-38a.  \nThe court held that “the district court erred in denying \n[respondents’] motion to dismiss” based on comity, and \nit therefore declined to “address the subsequent stages \nof th[e] litigation.”  Id. at 2a & n.2. \n\nThe court of appeals explained that, “[t]o determine \nwhether to abstain from asserting jurisdiction on comity \ngrounds,” a court hearing a Sherman Act suit should ap-\nply a “multi-factor balancing test” drawn from Timber-\nlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of America, 549 F.2d 597 (9th \nCir. 1976) (Timberlane), and Mannington Mills, Inc. v. \nCongoleum  Corp.,  595  F.2d  1287  (3d  Cir.  1979).    Pet. \nApp. 14a-15a.  In this case, the court focused primarily \n\n \n\f5 \n\non the first factor, which asks whether there was a “true \nconflict” between U.S. and Chinese law.  Id. at 18a. \n\nThe court of appeals concluded that the existence of \na true conflict “hinges on the amount of deference” that \nis  owed  to  the  Ministry’s  characterization  of  Chinese \nlaw.  Pet. App. 20a.  The court acknowledged that there \nis  “competing  authority”  on  that  question,  and  that \nsome  courts  have  declined  to  “accept  such  statements \nas conclusive.”  Id. at 20a-21a.  But the court held that, \nwhen a foreign sovereign “directly participates in U.S. \ncourt proceedings” and offers an interpretation that is \n“reasonable under the circumstances,” “a U.S. court is \nbound to defer.”  Id. at 25a.  The court then held, based \non  the  Ministry’s  submissions,  that  “Chinese  law  re-\nquired  [respondents]  to  engage  in  activities  in  China \nthat constituted antitrust violations here in the United \nStates.”  Ibid.  The court limited itself to the analysis in \nthe Ministry’s brief and did not consider the apparently \ncontradictory  statements  or  other  evidence  identified \nby the district court.  Id. at 27a-33a. \n\nHaving  found  a  true  conflict,  the  court  of  appeals \nstated that the remaining comity factors “clearly weigh \nin favor of U.S. courts abstaining from asserting juris-\ndiction.”  Pet. App. 33a.  Inter alia, the court noted that \nrespondents are Chinese companies, that their conduct \nhad occurred in China, and that (according to the Min-\nistry) this suit had “negatively affected U.S.-China re-\nlations.”  Id. at 34a-35. \n\nDISCUSSION \n\nThe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be \ngranted, limited to the second question presented.  That \nquestion  seeks  review  of  the  court  of  appeals’  holding \nthat  the  Ministry’s  brief  conclusively  established  the \ncontent of Chinese law during the prior  period of time \n\n \n\f6 \n\nthat is at issue in this case.  A federal court determining \nforeign law should give substantial weight to a foreign \ngovernment’s characterization of its own law.  But a sub-\nmission from a foreign government need not be treated \nas  conclusive  in  all  circumstances,  and  it  does  not  pre-\nclude  the  court  from  considering  other  relevant  mate-\nrial.    The  court  of  appeals’  contrary  holding  warrants \nfurther review because it departs from the decisions of \nother circuits on an important question of federal law. \n\nPetitioners  also  contend  that  the  court  of  appeals \nerred by reviewing the denial of respondents’ motion to \ndismiss,  and  that  courts  may  never  dismiss  Sherman \nAct claims based on considerations of comity.  Those ad-\nditional  questions  do  not  warrant  this  Court’s  review.  \nThey  do  not  implicate  any  conflict  among  the  circuits, \nand they were neither briefed below nor expressly ad-\ndressed by the court of appeals. \n\nI.  THIS  COURT  SHOULD  REVIEW  THE  COURT  OF  \nAPPEALS’ HOLDING THAT THE MINISTRY’S AMICUS \nBRIEF  CONCLUSIVELY  ESTABLISHED  THE  CON-\nTENT OF CHINESE LAW \n\nA.  A Foreign Government’s Characterization Of Its Own \nLaw  Is  Entitled  To  Substantial  Weight,  But  It  Is  Not \nConclusive  \n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 was adopted in \n1966 to establish an “effective procedure for raising and \ndetermining  an  issue  concerning  the  law  of  a  foreign \ncountry.”    Fed.  R.  Civ.  P.  44.1  advisory  committee’s \nnote (1966) (Adoption).  The rule states that the deter-\nmination  of  foreign  law  is  a  “question  of  law”  for  the \ncourt rather than a question of fact  for the jury.  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 44.1.  It further provides that, “[i]n determin-\ning  foreign  law,  the  court  may  consider  any  relevant \n\n \n\f7 \n\nmaterial or source, including testimony, whether or not \nsubmitted by  a party or  admissible  under the  Federal \nRules  of  Evidence.”    Ibid.;  see  Fed.  R.  Crim.  P.  26.1 \n(similar).   \n\nRule 44.1 reflects a judgment that courts should have \n“maximum  flexibility  about  the  material  to  be  consid-\nered and the methodology to be employed in determin-\ning foreign law in a particular case.”  9A Charles Alan \nWright & Arthur R. Miller, Federal Practice and Pro-\ncedure  §  2444,  at  349  (3d  ed.  2008).    Courts  rely  on  a \nvariety  of  materials,  including  “[s]tatutes,  administra-\ntive  material,  and  judicial  decisions”;  “expert  testi-\nmony”  interpreting  those  primary  sources;  and  “any \nother  information”  that  may  be  probative.    Id.  at  342-\n343;  see,  e.g.,  Bodum  USA,  Inc.  v.  La  Cafetiere,  Inc., \n621 F.3d 624, 628 (7th Cir. 2010). \n\nFederal courts considering questions of foreign law \nare sometimes presented with the views of the relevant \nforeign government.  The foreign government may be a \nparty to the suit, see, e.g., In re Oil Spill by the Amoco \nCadiz, 954 F.2d 1279, 1312 (7th Cir. 1992) (Amoco Ca-\ndiz), or (as in this case) it may express its views through \nan  amicus brief  or similar  submission, Pet.  App.  189a-\n223a; see, e.g., United States v. McNab, 331 F.3d 1228, \n1239-1240 & n.23 (11th Cir. 2003), cert. denied, 540 U.S. \n1177  (2004).    A  federal  court  determining  foreign  law \nmay also consider views that the relevant foreign gov-\nernment has expressed in another context.  See, e.g., Ac-\ncess  Telecom,  Inc.  v.  MCI  Telecomms.  Corp.,  197  F.3d \n694,  714  (5th  Cir.  1999),  cert.  denied,  531  U.S.  917 \n(2000).  \n\nA federal court should afford substantial weight to a \nforeign  government’s  characterization  of  its  own  law.  \nThat weight reflects “the spirit of cooperation in which \n\n \n\f8 \n\na domestic tribunal approaches the resolution of cases \ntouching  the  laws  and  interests  of  other  sovereign \nstates.”  Société Nationale Industrielle Aérospatiale v. \nUnited States Dist. Court, 482 U.S. 522, 543 n.27 (1987).  \nIt also makes practical sense.  “Among the most logical \nsources  for  [a]  court  to  look  to  in  its  determination  of \nforeign law are the [relevant] foreign officials,” who are \nfamiliar with the context and the nuances of the foreign \nlegal system.  McNab, 331 F.3d at 1241. \n\nFederal  courts should  not, however,  treat  a foreign \ngovernment’s characterizations as conclusive in all cir-\ncumstances.  When “a foreign government changes its \noriginal position” or otherwise makes conflicting state-\nments,  a  court  is  not  bound  to  accept  its  most  recent \nstatement, or the one offered in litigation.  McNab, 331 \nF.3d at 1241.  A court likewise need not credit a state-\nment that is unclear or unsupported, or that fails to ad-\ndress relevant authorities.  See, e.g., McKesson HBOC, \nInc.  v.  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran,  271  F.3d  1101,  1108-\n1109 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (McKesson), cert. denied, 537 U.S. \n941 (2002), vacated in part on other grounds, 320 F.3d \n280 (D.C. Cir. 2003).  The precise weight to be given to \na  foreign  government’s  statement  turns  on  factors  in-\ncluding the statement’s clarity, thoroughness, and sup-\nport; its context and purpose; the authority of the entity \nmaking it; its consistency with past statements; and any \nother corroborating or contradictory evidence.1 \n\n1   In  Matsushita  Electric  Industrial  Co.  v.  Zenith  Radio  Corp., \n475  U.S.  574  (1986)  (Matsushita),  the  United  States  suggested  a \nmore deferential approach, arguing that when a foreign government \nsubmits a statement characterizing its own law, federal courts “gen-\nerally” must “accept that statement at face value.”  U.S. Amicus Br. \nat 23, Matsushita, supra (No. 83-2004).  But the Matsushita brief \nclarified that courts are not bound to accept “[p]lainly ambiguous or \n\n \n                                                      \n\f9 \n\nB.  The Court Of Appeals Erred By Treating The Ministry’s \nAmicus  Brief  As  Conclusive  And  Disregarding  Other \nRelevant Materials \n\n1.  The court of appeals held that, when a foreign gov-\nernment  “directly  participates  in  U.S.  court  proceed-\nings” and offers a characterization of its law that is “rea-\nsonable under the circumstances,” the court “is bound to \ndefer.”  Pet. App. 25a.  That formulation would not nec-\nessarily be problematic if the qualifier “reasonable un-\nder the circumstances” allowed a court to assess the rea-\nsonableness  of  the  foreign  government’s  statements  \nin  light  of  all  relevant  circumstances.    The  totality  of  \nthe  court  of  appeals’  opinion,  however,  indicates  that  \nit adopted and applied a far more deferential standard, \nunder  which  a  court  is  bound  to  accept  a  foreign  \ngovernment’s  characterization—and  may  not  consider \nother material—unless that characterization is facially  \nunreasonable.   \n\nThus,  the  court  of  appeals disagreed  with  decisions \nholding  that  U.S.  courts  need  not  treat  a  foreign  gov-\nernment’s  characterization  as  “conclusive.”    Pet.  App. \n21a.  The court also stated that, if deference “is to mean \nanything, it must mean that a U.S. court not embark on \na challenge to a foreign government’s official represen-\ntation.”  Id. at 25a-26a.  Most importantly, in concluding \n\ninternally  inconsistent  statements,”  and  it  added  that  courts  may \nlook behind a foreign government’s statement in “extraordinary cir-\ncumstances.”    Ibid.    More  recently,  in  McNab,  the  United  States \nendorsed  what  had  by  then  become  the  courts  of  appeals’  general \npractice  of  affording  “substantial—but  measured—deference  to  a \nforeign nation’s representations.”  U.S. Br. in Opp. at 16-17, McNab \nv. United States, 540 U.S. 1177 (2004) (No. 03-622).  That more nu-\nanced approach is consistent with the position advocated here.  To \nthe extent the Matsushita brief suggested a different standard, it \nno longer reflects the views of the United States.  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f10 \n\nthat the Ministry’s brief was a “reasonable” characteri-\nzation  warranting  deference, id.  at  27a,  the  court  lim-\nited its inquiry to the four corners of the brief and the \nsources cited therein, id. at 27a-29a. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  thus  did  not  acknowledge  the \nChamber’s public statement that respondents had “vol-\nuntarily” agreed on prices and quantities “without any \ngovernment  intervention.”    Pet.  App.  173a-174a  (em-\nphases and citation omitted).  It also did not address the \ndistrict  court’s  conclusion  that  the  Ministry’s  submis-\nsions “fail[ed] to address key provisions” of the govern-\ning legal regime.  Id. at 119a; see id. at 97a & n.24.  And \nbecause the court concluded that the Ministry’s amicus \nbrief  precluded  consideration  of  other  material,  it  did \nnot  address  the  more  extensive  record  developed  at \nsummary  judgment,  including,  in  particular,  China’s \nrepresentation  to  the  WTO  that  it  had  “g[i]ve[n]  up  \nexport  administration  of    . . .    vitamin  C.”    Id.  at  74a  \n(citation  omitted).    Those  circumstances  are,  at  mini-\nmum,  relevant  to  the  weight  that  the  Ministry’s  brief \nshould  receive.    A  standard  that  does  not  permit  a  \ncourt even to consider such information is inconsistent \nwith federal courts’ responsibility to “determin[e] foreign \nlaw” based on “any relevant material or source.”  Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 44.1. \n\n2.  The  court  of  appeals  believed  that  its  rigid  ap-\nproach was compelled by United States v. Pink, 315 U.S. \n203 (1942).  Pet. App. 20a, 22a-23a.  In Pink, which pre-\nceded the adoption of Rule 44.1, the United States had \nobtained an “official declaration by the Commissariat of \nJustice”  of  the  Soviet  Union  defining  the  extraterrito-\nrial  reach  of  a  Russian  decree.    315  U.S.  at  218.    The \nCourt concluded that, because “the evidence supported \n[a]  finding”  that  “the  Commissariat  for  Justice  ha[d] \n\n \n\f11 \n\npower  to  interpret  existing  Russian  law,”  the  “official \ndeclaration [wa]s  conclusive so  far  as the intended  ex-\ntraterritorial  effect  of  the  Russian  decree  [wa]s  con-\ncerned.”  Id. at 220. \n\nBecause the Commissariat was empowered to render \nan authoritative construction of Russian law, the official \ndeclaration in Pink was in some respects analogous to a \nstate supreme court’s answer to a question of state law \ncertified by a federal court.  Cf. United States v. Juve-\nnile Male, 560 U.S. 558, 561 (2010) (per curiam).  There \nwas  also  apparently  no  indication  that  the  declaration \nwas incomplete or inconsistent with the Soviet Union’s \npast statements on the question.  This Court’s holding \nthat  the  Commissariat’s  declaration  was  “conclusive” \nunder those circumstances does not suggest that every \nsubmission  by  a  foreign  government  is  entitled  to  the \nsame weight. \n\n3.  The court of appeals also reasoned that a foreign \ngovernment’s characterization of its own laws should be \nafforded  “the  same  respect  and  treatment  that  we \nwould expect our government to receive in comparable \nmatters.”  Pet. App. 26a.  That concern for reciprocity \nis sound, but it does not support the court’s conclusion.  \nWhen the Department of Justice litigates questions of \nU.S.  law  in  foreign  tribunals,  it  expects  that  its  views \nwill be afforded substantial weight, and that its charac-\nterizations of U.S. law will be accepted because they are \naccurate and well-supported.  But the Department his-\ntorically  has not  argued that  foreign courts  are  bound \nto  accept  its  characterizations  or  precluded  from  con-\nsidering other relevant material.  And the Department \nis not aware of any foreign-court decision holding that \n\n \n\f12 \n\nthe  Department’s  representations  are  entitled  to such \nconclusive weight. 2 \n\nC.  The Court Of Appeals’ Error Warrants Further Review \nThe degree of deference that a court owes to a for-\neign government’s characterization of its own law is an \nimportant  and  recurring  question,  and  foreign  sover-\neigns considering making their views known to federal \ncourts should understand the standards that will be ap-\nplied to their submissions.  The court of appeals’ deci-\nsion  warrants  further  review  because  it  departs  from \nthe  decisions  of  other  circuits  and  creates  uncertainty \nabout  the  proper  treatment  of  foreign  governments’ \ncharacterizations of their laws. \n\nThe  court  of  appeals  acknowledged  that  there  is \n“competing authority” on the question presented, and it \nexpressly disagreed with the Seventh Circuit’s decision \nin Amoco  Cadiz.  Pet.  App.  20a-21a.   Respondents  ob-\nserve (Br. in Opp. 23-24) that the court in Amoco Cadiz \nultimately  adopted  the  French government’s  interpre-\ntation  of  French  law.   The  court  did  so,  however,  only \nbecause  it  found  that  interpretation  “plausible”  based \n\n2   The  understanding  that  a  government’s  expressed  view  of  its \nown law is entitled to substantial but not conclusive weight is con-\nsistent with two international treaties that establish mechanisms by \nwhich one state may obtain from another an official statement char-\nacterizing  its  laws.    Those  treaties  specify  that  “[t]he  information \ngiven  in  reply shall  not  bind  the  judicial  authority  from  which the \nrequest emanated.”  European Convention on Information on For-\neign Law art. 8, June 7, 1968, 720 U.N.T.S. 154; see Organization of \nAmerican States, Inter-American Convention on Proof of and Infor-\nmation on Foreign Law art. 6, May 8, 1979, O.A.S.T.S. No. 53, 1439 \nU.N.T.S. 111 (similar).  Although the United States is not a party to \nthose treaties, they further confirm that the court of appeals’ rule is \nout of step with international practice. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f13 \n\non  all  of  the  circumstances,  including  the  French  gov-\nernment’s  statements  in  other  contexts.    954  F.2d  at \n1312.  The Seventh Circuit did not treat the French gov-\nernment’s submission as conclusive.   \n\nOther  courts  of  appeals  have  rejected  foreign  gov-\nernments’  characterizations  of  their  own  laws  even \nwhere,  as  here,  those  governments  appeared  in  U.S. \ncourt.  In McNab, for example, the Eleventh Circuit de-\nclined  to  accept  “the  Honduran  government’s  current \ninterpretation  of  its  laws,”  as  reflected  in  an  amicus \nbrief, because that interpretation was inconsistent with \nearlier  statements  by  Honduran  officials.    331  F.3d  at \n1242.    And  in  McKesson,  the  D.C.  Circuit  rejected \n“Iran’s contention that its corporate law requires share-\nholders  * * *  to physically appear at a company’s office  \n* * *  in  order  to collect  dividends.”   271  F.3d  at  1108.  \nThe D.C. Circuit declined to adopt that construction be-\ncause it was not supported by the affidavits submitted \nby Iran’s experts.  Id. at 1108-1109.  The approach re-\nflected in those decisions is consistent with the role of \nfederal  courts  under  Rule  44.1,  and  inconsistent  with \nthe rule of conclusive deference that the Second Circuit \napplied in this case.   \n\nII.  THIS COURT SHOULD DENY REVIEW OF PETITION-\nERS’  CONTENTION  THAT  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS \nERRED BY REVIEWING THE DENIAL OF RESPOND-\nENTS’ MOTION TO DISMISS  \nPetitioners contend (Pet. 19-22) that the court of ap-\npeals erred by reviewing the denial of respondents’ mo-\ntion to dismiss in an appeal from a judgment following \na  trial  on  the  merits.    Petitioners  are  correct  that  the \ndenial  of  the  motion  to  dismiss  was  effectively  super-\nseded when the district court revisited the comity issue \nlater  in  the  litigation.    But  the  comity  question  was \n\n \n\f14 \n\nproperly  before  the  court  of  appeals,  and  the  court’s  \nunexplained decision to focus on the motion to dismiss \ndoes not appear to have affected its ultimate conclusion.  \nThat decision thus does not warrant this Court’s review, \nparticularly because the issue was not briefed below or \nexpressly addressed by the court of appeals. \n\nA. “The general rule is that ‘a party is entitled to a \nsingle  appeal,  to  be  deferred  until  final  judgment  has \nbeen  entered,  in  which  claims  of  district  court  error  \nat  any  stage  of  the  litigation  may  be  ventilated.’ ”  \nQuackenbush  v.  Allstate  Ins.  Co.,  517  U.S.  706,  712 \n(1996)  (citation  omitted).    Accordingly,  although  most \ninterlocutory orders are not themselves appealable, an \n“appeal  from  [a]  final  judgment  opens  the  record  and \npermits  review  of  all  rulings  that  led  up  to  the  judg-\nment.”  15A Charles Alan Wright et al., Federal Prac-\ntice and Procedure § 3905.1, at 250 (2d ed. 1992). \n\nIn  some  circumstances,  however,  an  interlocutory \norder is effectively superseded by subsequent develop-\nments in the district court.  In Ortiz v. Jordan, 562 U.S. \n180 (2011), for example, this Court held that a court of \nappeals  generally  may  not  review  “an  order  denying \nsummary judgment after a full trial on the merits” be-\ncause “the full record developed [at trial] supersedes the \nrecord  existing  at  the  time  of  the  summary-judgment \nmotion.”  Id. at 184.  A defendant is still free to challenge \nthe sufficiency of the plaintiff ’s proof, but that challenge \n“must be evaluated in light of the character and quality \nof the evidence received in court.”  Ibid. \n\nIn this case, respondents raised their comity defense \nin a motion to dismiss, a motion for summary judgment, \nand  a  motion  for  judgment  as  a  matter  of  law  under \nRule 50(b).  Pet. App. 41a & n.3.  Each time, the district \ncourt  rejected  that  defense  based  on  a  progressively \n\n \n\f15 \n\nmore developed record.  Under the circumstances, the \ncourt of appeals erred in focusing on the “denial of [re-\nspondents’] motion to dismiss” and ignoring “the subse-\nquent stages of th[e] litigation.”  Id. at 2a n.2.  The dis-\ntrict court ultimately decided the comity question based \non  a  more  complete  record,  which  “supersede[d]  the \nrecord existing at the time of the [motion to dismiss].”  \nOrtiz, 562 U.S. at 184.   \n\nB. Although  it  was  erroneous,  the  court  of  appeals’ \nfocus on the motion to dismiss does not appear to have \naffected the outcome below and would not likely affect \nany proceedings  on  remand.    Because  the  court incor-\nrectly  believed  that  the  Ministry’s  brief  had  to  be  ac-\ncepted as conclusive, it declined to consider other mate-\nrial in the motion-to-dismiss record—a conclusion that \nwould have applied equally to the more extensive record \ndeveloped  later.    And  if  this  Court  grants  review  and \nholds that the Ministry’s brief is not entitled to conclu-\nsive  weight,  the  court  of  appeals  can  reconsider  the  \nforeign-law issue on remand in light of all of the perti-\nnent record materials.3 \n\nPetitioners assert (Pet. 22) that the court of appeals’ \nfocus on the motion to dismiss was dispositive because \n“[r]espondents’  failure  to  raise  comity  as  a  defense  in \ntheir  pre-verdict  Rule  50(a)  motion  barred  them  from \nseeking relief on that ground in their post-verdict Rule \n50(b) motion, and on any appeal.”  It is true that, absent \na  Rule  50(b)  motion,  “an  appellate  court  is  ‘powerless’ \nto  review  the  sufficiency  of  the  evidence  after  trial.”  \n\n3   Indeed, the court of appeals stated that, but for the Ministry’s \nbrief, “the district court’s careful and thorough treatment of the ev-\nidence before it  * * *  at both the motion to dismiss and summary \njudgment stages would have been entirely appropriate.”  Pet. App. \n30a n.10. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f16 \n\nOrtiz, 562 U.S. at 189 (citation omitted).  It is also true \nthat “[a] motion under Rule 50(b) is not allowed unless \nthe  movant  sought  relief  on  similar  grounds”  under \nRule 50(a).  Exxon Shipping Co. v. Baker, 554 U.S. 471, \n485 n.5 (2008).  For two reasons, however, those princi-\nples did not preclude the court of appeals from deciding \nthe comity question.  \n\nFirst, comity does not concern “the sufficiency of the \nevidence.”  Ortiz, 562 U.S. at 189.  Both the determina-\ntion of foreign law and the ultimate decision whether to \ndismiss  a  claim  on  comity  grounds  are  made  by  the \ncourt, not the jury.  Fed. R. Civ. P. 44.1; see Pet. App. \n42a.    Indeed,  “given  the  important  role  that  comity \nplays” in protecting interests that transcend the parties \nto a particular case, a court may overlook a party’s fail-\nure to raise the issue.  Gucci Am., Inc. v. Weixing Li, \n768 F.3d 122, 138-140 (2d Cir. 2014).4  \n\nSecond,  petitioners  have  forfeited  their  Rule  50(a) \nargument.  Petitioners did not object when respondents \nraised  comity  in  their  Rule  50(b)  motion.    D.  Ct.  Doc. \n702, at 24-31 (May 10, 2013).  Where, as here, “the non-\nmoving  party  fails  to  object  to  a  Rule  50(b)  motion  on \nthe  grounds  of  waiver,  the  objection  itself  is  deemed \nwaived.”  Gronowski v. Spencer, 424 F.3d 285, 297 (2d \nCir. 2005).  And petitioners forfeited the argument  again \nby failing to raise it on appeal.  Pet. C.A. Br. 44-45.   \n\n4  Contrary to respondents’ suggestion (Br. in Opp. 15), principles \nof international comity do not bear on the court’s subject-matter ju-\nrisdiction.    See  Cooper  v.  Tokyo  Elec.  Power  Co.,  860  F.3d  1193, \n1209-1210 (9th Cir. 2017); cf. Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, \n514-516 (2006).  Courts thus have the power, but not a jurisdictional \nobligation, to raise comity sua sponte. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f17 \n\nC. The  comity  issue  thus  was  properly  before  the \ncourt of appeals, even though the court erred by focus-\ning on the motion to dismiss rather than on the full rec-\nord.   Petitioners  assert (Pet.  19-20)  that this  aspect  of \nthe court of appeals’ decision conflicts with decisions of \nthe Fifth, Sixth, and Tenth Circuits holding that a court \nof appeals may not review the denial of a motion to dis-\nmiss after a trial on the merits.  But those decisions in-\nvolved motions to dismiss for failure to plead facts suf-\nficient  to  state  a  claim,  not  motions  based  on  interna-\ntional comity.  And even if the court of appeals’ decision \ncreated a circuit conflict, this case would not be an ap-\npropriate vehicle in which to resolve it because the issue \nwas  neither  briefed  below  nor  explicitly  addressed  by \nthe court of appeals.  See Cutter v. Wilkinson, 544 U.S. \n709, 718 n.7 (2005) (“[W]e are a court of review, not of \nfirst view.”). \n\nIII.  PETITIONERS’  CONTENTION  THAT  COURTS  MAY \nNOT  DISMISS  SHERMAN  ACT  CLAIMS  BASED  ON \nINTERNATIONAL  COMITY  DOES  NOT  WARRANT \nTHIS COURT’S REVIEW   \n\nPetitioners contend (Pet. 29-34) that a federal court \nmay never invoke principles of comity to dismiss a Sher-\nman Act claim.  Petitioners did not raise that argument \nbelow, and the court of appeals’ implicit conclusion that \ncomity-based  dismissals  are  sometimes  permissible \ndoes not conflict with any decision of this Court or an-\nother court of appeals.  Further review is not warranted. \nA. This  Court has  long  held  that  “the  Sherman  Act \napplies  to  foreign  conduct  that  was  meant  to  produce \nand  did  in  fact  produce  some  substantial  effect  in  the \nUnited  States.”    Hartford  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  California, \n509 U.S. 764, 796 (1993).  In Section 402 of the Foreign \nTrade  Antitrust  Improvements  Act  of  1982  (FTAIA), \n\n \n \n\f18 \n\nPub. L. No. 97-290, Tit. IV, 96 Stat 1246 (15 U.S.C. 6a), \nCongress  confirmed  that  understanding  and  clarified \nthe application of the Sherman Act to conduct involving \nforeign commerce.  Under the FTAIA, the Sherman Act \ngenerally does not reach “commercial activities taking \nplace  abroad,  unless  those  activities  adversely  affect \ndomestic commerce” or “imports to the United States.”  \nF. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd. v. Empagran S.A., 542 U.S. \n155, 161 (2004) (Empagran). \n\nComity is often described as “the recognition which \none nation allows within its territory to the legislative, \nexecutive or judicial acts of another nation, having due \nregard both to international duty and convenience, and \nto the rights of its own citizens or of other persons who \nare under the protection of its laws.”  Hilton v. Guyot, \n159 U.S. 113, 164 (1895).  The Sherman Act does not ex-\npressly incorporate principles of comity.  But the comity \ndoctrine  had  already  been  established  when  the  Sher-\nman Act was enacted, see, e.g., id. at 165-166, and it thus \nformed  a  part  of  the  “contemporary  legal  context  in \nwhich Congress acted,” Associated Gen. Contractors of \nCal., Inc. v. California State Council of Carpenters, 459 \nU.S. 519, 532 (1983).  This Court has often looked to that \ncontext  in  “ascertain[ing]  the  intended  scope”  and  ap-\nplication  of  the  Sherman  Act’s  broadly  worded  provi-\nsions.  Ibid.   \n\nConsistent  with  that  understanding,  courts  of  ap-\npeals have long held that courts may, in unusual circum-\nstances,  dismiss  private  Sherman  Act  claims  based  on \nprinciples of comity.  See, e.g., Mannington Mills, Inc. \nv. Congoleum Corp., 595 F.2d 1287, 1297-1298 (3d Cir. \n1979); Timberlane Lumber Co. v. Bank of Am., 549 F.2d \n597, 613-615 (9th Cir. 1976).  Those courts have consid-\nered a variety of factors, including: \n\n \n\f19 \n\n[T]he  degree  of  conflict  with  foreign  law  or  policy, \nthe nationality or allegiance of the parties and the lo-\ncations  or  principal  places  of  business  of  corpora-\ntions,  the  extent  to  which  enforcement  by  either \nstate can be expected to achieve compliance, the rel-\native significance of effects on the United States as \ncompared with those elsewhere, the extent to which \nthere is explicit purpose to harm or affect American \ncommerce, the foreseeability of such effect, and the \nrelative importance to the violations charged of con-\nduct within the United States as compared with con-\nduct abroad. \n\nTimberlane,  549  F.2d  at  614;  see  Mannington  Mills, \n595  F.2d  at  1297-1298  (similar  ten-factor  test).    Con-\ngress  did  not  disturb  those  decisions  when  it  enacted \nthe FTAIA.  To the contrary, the House Report accom-\npanying the FTAIA cited Timberlane and specified that \nthe FTAIA “would have no effect on the courts’ ability \nto employ notions of comity.”  H.R. Rep. No. 686, 97th \nCong., 2d Sess. 13 (1982).    \n  Comity-based  dismissals  should  be  rare,  because \nCongress unambiguously intended the Sherman Act to \nreach foreign conduct and because federal courts “have \nthe power, and ordinarily the obligation, to decide cases \nand  controversies  properly  presented  to  them.”    W.S. \nKirkpatrick  &  Co.  v.  Environmental  Tectonics  Corp., \nInt’l, 493 U.S. 400, 409 (1990).  But in the United States’ \nview,  federal  courts  may,  in  extraordinary  circum-\nstances,  dismiss  private  Sherman  Act  claims  based  on \nprinciples of comity. 5 \n\n5   Although  courts  may  engage  in  a  comity  analysis  in  private \nSherman Act suits, they should not do so in actions brought by fed-\neral agencies.  The government’s decision to bring an enforcement \naction “represents a determination that the importance of antitrust \n\n \n                                                      \n\f20 \n\nB. The United States does not endorse all aspects of \nthe court of appeals’ comity analysis.  For example, un-\nder the circumstances presented here, respondents’ ar-\ngument  that  Chinese  law  required  them  to  engage  in \nthe challenged conduct might have been better analyzed \nunder  the  rubric  of  the  foreign  sovereign  compulsion \ndoctrine rather than through a comity analysis.  Cf. U.S. \nDep’t  of  Justice  &  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n,  Antitrust \nGuidelines for International Enforcement and Cooper-\nation § 4.2.2, at 32-34 (2017).  The court also gave inad-\nequate weight to the interests of the U.S. victims of the \nalleged  price-fixing  cartel  and  to  the  interests  of  the \nUnited States in enforcement of its antitrust laws.  Pet. \nApp.  34a-35a.    Conversely,  the  court  gave  too  much \nweight to China’s objections to this suit.  Id. at 35a.  Un-\nlike a statement from the Executive Branch, a foreign \nsovereign’s objection to a suit does not, in itself, neces-\nsarily indicate that the case will harm U.S. foreign rela-\ntions.  But petitioners do not seek this Court’s review of \nthe court of appeals’ specific application of comity prin-\nciples;  they  argue  that  the  court  should  not  have  per-\nformed  a  comity  analysis  at  all.    That  aspect  of  the \ncourt’s  decision  does  not  conflict  with  any  decision  of \nthis Court or another court of appeals. \n\n1.  In  Hartford  Fire,  this  Court  declined  to  decide \nwhether a court may dismiss a Sherman Act claim based \non comity.  509 U.S. at 798.  The Court has not explicitly \n\nenforcement outweighs any relevant foreign policy concerns.”  U.S. \nDep’t  of  Justice  &  Fed.  Trade  Comm’n,  Antitrust  Guidelines  for \nInternational  Enforcement  and  Cooperation  §  4.1,  at  28  (2017).  \nGiven the primacy of the Executive Branch in the realm of foreign \npolicy, courts should not “second-guess the executive branch’s judg-\nment as to the proper role of comity concerns” in antitrust enforce-\nment actions.  United States v. Baker Hughes Inc., 731 F. Supp. 3, \n6 n.5 (D.D.C. 1990). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f21 \n\nrevisited  that  issue  in  the  intervening  years,  but peti-\ntioners assert (Pet. 31-32) that the Court implicitly fore-\nclosed  comity-based  dismissals  in  Empagran.    That  is \nnot  correct.    In  Empagran,  the  Court  considered  the \nFTAIA’s  directive  that  the  Sherman  Act  reaches  con-\nduct involving non-import foreign commerce only if the \nconduct’s  effect  on  U.S.  commerce  “gives  rise  to  a \nclaim” under the Sherman Act.  15 U.S.C. 6a(2); see Em-\npagran,  542 U.S.  at  174.   The  Court  held  that,  when  a \nSherman Act violation “adversely affects both custom-\ners outside the United States and customers within the \nUnited  States,  but  the  adverse  foreign  effect  is  inde-\npendent of any adverse domestic effect,” a plaintiff who \nsuffers only foreign harm may not sue.  542 U.S. at 164.   \nIn reaching that conclusion, this Court rejected the \nplaintiffs’  argument  that  courts  should  deal  with  the \nproblems posed by foreign-injury cases by “abstaining \nwhere  comity  considerations  so  dictate.”    Empagran, \n542 U.S. at 168.  The Court deemed that approach “too \ncomplex,”  and  instead  interpreted  the  FTAIA  to  “ex-\nclude  independent  foreign  injury  cases  across  the \nboard.”  Ibid.  In so holding, however, the Court did not \npurport  to  resolve  the  question  left  open  in  Hartford \nFire or to bar courts from invoking comity principles in \ncases  that  fall  within  the  scope  of  the Sherman  Act  as \nclarified by the FTAIA. \n\n2.  Petitioners  are  also  wrong  in  asserting  (Pet.  32-\n33)  that  other  courts  of  appeals  have  rejected  the  ap-\nproach  to  comity  reflected  in  Timberlane  and  Man-\nnington  Mills.    To  the  contrary,  one  of  the  decisions \nthey  cite  “commend[ed]  the[]  analysis”  in  those  cases \nand agreed that “[a] district court should not apply the \nantitrust  laws  to  foreign  conduct  or  foreign  actors  if \n\n \n\f22 \n\nsuch application would violate principles of comity.”  In-\ndustrial Inv. Dev. Corp. v. Mitsui & Co., 671 F.2d 876, \n884 & n.7 (5th Cir. 1982), vacated, 460 U.S. 1007 (1983).  \nThe  remaining  decisions  on  which  petitioners  rely \nsimply  interpreted  the  Sherman  Act’s  extraterritorial \nreach; they did not address any case-specific comity ar-\nguments, much less hold that such arguments are cate-\ngorically foreclosed.  In re Monosodium Glutamate An-\ntitrust Litig., 477 F.3d 535, 538-539 (8th Cir. 2007); Em-\npagran  S.A.  v.  F.  Hoffmann-Laroche  Ltd.,  417  F.3d \n1267, 1271 (D.C. Cir. 2005), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1092 \n(2006). \n\nC. Even if the comity question otherwise warranted \nthis Court’s review, this case would not be an appropri-\nate  vehicle  in  which  to  consider  it.    As  petitioners \nacknowledge  (Reply  Br.  13),  they  did  not  argue  below \nthat  comity-based  dismissals  are  categorically  imper-\nmissible, and the court of appeals therefore did not con-\nsider  that  argument.    This  Court’s  “traditional  rule  \n* * *    precludes  a  grant  of  certiorari”  where,  as  here, \n“ ‘the  question  presented  was  not  pressed  or  passed \nupon below.’ ”  United States v. Williams, 504 U.S. 36, \n41  (1992)  (citation  omitted).  Petitioners  identify  no \nsound reason to depart from that rule here. \n\n \n \n \n\f23 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nThe  petition  for  a  writ  of  certiorari  should  be \n\ngranted, limited to the second question presented. \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\n  NOEL J.
