        "INTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \n\nAmicus Ministry of Commerce of the People’s Repub-\nlic  of  China \n(the  “Ministry,”  sometimes  called \nMOFCOM) is a component of the central Chinese gov-\nernment and the highest administrative authority in \nChina authorized to regulate foreign trade.  The Min-\nistry  is  the  equivalent  of  a U.S.  cabinet-level  depart-\nment. Chinese law places the Ministry in charge of for-\neign trade throughout the country.  The Ministry ac-\ncordingly  formulates  strategies,  guidelines,  and  poli-\ncies concerning domestic and foreign trade and inter-\nnational cooperation.  It also drafts and enforces trade \nlaws  and  regulations,  and  regulates  markets.    And \ncontrary  to  Petitioners’  groundless  suggestion,  the \nMinistry’s authority to interpret the regulations at is-\nsue here was established below and is incontestable. \n\nThe Ministry has been actively involved in this liti-\ngation since 2005. It first presented the Chinese gov-\nernment’s authoritative interpretation of Chinese law \nin  2006,  when  it  filed  an  amicus  brief  in  the  district \ncourt. It reaffirmed its position in supplemental sub-\nmissions to the district court in 2008 and 2009, and in \nan amicus brief in the court of appeals in 2014. As both \ncourts  below  observed,  this  was  “historic.”  Pet.  App. \n6a. Never before had “any entity of the Chinese Gov-\nernment  …  appeared  amicus  curiae  before  any  U.S. \ncourt.” Id. at 6a n.5. \n\nThe  Ministry’s  submissions  explained  the  Chinese \ntrade regulations that, at relevant times (2002–2005), \nrequired the defendant companies to coordinate their \n\n1 No  counsel  for  any  party  authored  this  brief  in  whole  or  in \npart, and no other entity or person made any monetary contribu-\ntion  toward  the  preparation  and  submission  of  this  brief.    The \nparties have consenting to the filing of this brief.",
        "2 \n\nexport activities.  China further made clear, in a 2014 \ndiplomatic note to the State Department, that the Min-\nistry spoke for the Chinese Government in this litiga-\ntion. \n\nUnfortunately,  the  Ministry’s  efforts  to  assist  the \ndistrict court in understanding the meaning of its reg-\nulations,  including  by  explaining  the  economic,  cul-\ntural, linguistic, and legal context in which those reg-\nulations  were  created,  were  treated  with  open  suspi-\ncion  and  hostility.    The  district  court  even  asserted \nthat  the  Ministry’s  submissions  reflected  “a  post-hoc \nattempt  to  shield  defendants’  conduct  from  antitrust \nscrutiny.”    Pet.  App.  121a.    Petitioners  and  some  of \ntheir amici have continued that smear campaign here. \n\nThese accusations are profoundly disrespectful and \nwholly  unjustified.    As  the  Second  Circuit  explained, \nthe reasons the district court gave for disparaging the \nMinistry’s  submissions  were  ill-considered  and  at \npoints “nonsensical.”  Pet. App. 27a.  Consistent with \nits obligation to review de novo the district court’s for-\neign-law  determination,  the  Second  Circuit  re-exam-\nined  the  Ministry’s  interpretation,  found  it  “reasona-\nble,”  and  therefore  deferred  to  it.    Id.    The  Ministry \nrespectfully  submits  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  ap-\nproach and conclusions are correct.  A contrary result \nwould signal to private parties that they should follow \nPetitioners’  lead  and  disparage  the  competence  and \nmotives  of  foreign  sovereigns  who  appear  in  U.S. \ncourts.  It  would  likewise  signal  to  foreign  sovereigns \nthat their interpretations of their own laws will not be \nrespected here.  Those signals would seriously disserve \nthe  interests  of  accurate  adjudication  and  interna-\ntional  comity,  to  the  detriment  of  courts,  regulators, \nand regulated parties around the world.",
        "3 \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nI.  THE SECOND CIRCUIT CORRECTLY HELD \nTHAT A U.S. COURT IS BOUND TO DEFER \nTO  A  FOREIGN  SOVEREIGN’S  REASONA-\nBLE EXPLANATION OF ITS OWN LAW.   \n\nA.  United  States v.  Pink  held  that  a  foreign  sover-\neign’s official interpretation of its law, offered for use \nin U.S. litigation, is “conclusive.”  315 U.S. 203, 218–\n20 (1942).  Pink’s holding is not narrowly confined to \nits facts; instead, as the United States previously told \nthis Court, Pink established that “American courts are \nobligated to accept [a foreign sovereign’s legal] state-\nment at face value” unless it is facially ambiguous, in-\nconsistent, or incredible.  Br. of United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae at 23, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio  Corp.,  475  U.S.  574  (1985)  (No.  83-2004) \n(Matsushita  U.S.  Br.).    In  Pink,  it  was  enough  that \nsome evidence supported the foreign sovereign’s inter-\npretation, even though the New York courts had held \nthat the voluminous record as a whole supported a dif-\nferent interpretation. \n\nThis Court’s other decisions have similarly relied on \nforeign  governments’  explanations  of  their  own  law, \nsubmitted (as here) through amicus briefs.  The courts \nof appeals, too, have consistently recognized that def-\nerence is warranted to a foreign government’s plausi-\nble interpretation of its own laws.  They have thus de-\nclined to defer where a foreign governmental body does \nnot appear before the court or its interpretive author-\nity is unclear, or where deferring to a changed inter-\npretation  on  appeal  would  disturb  the  finality  of  the \njudgment.    Nothing  of  the  kind  occurred  here.  The \nMinistry  presented  a  single,  unchanging  position \nthroughout this litigation.",
        "4 \n\nB.  Deference enhances the accuracy of U.S. courts’ \nforeign-law determinations.  The tools, doctrines, and \nintuitions that serve American judges so well in inter-\npreting U.S. law are frequently unhelpful or even mis-\nleading when it comes to foreign law.  Plain-language \nanalysis  of  translated  materials  is  treacherous,  and \nmay  not  accord  with  foreign  interpretive  principles.  \nSecondary sources may not exist in English.  And ex-\npert testimony frequently comes with a partisan spin. \n\nAccordingly, it is only logical to regard a foreign sov-\nereign’s  official  and  reasonable  interpretation  of  its \nown  law as  “conclusive.”  The  district  court’s  analysis \nhere  vividly illustrates  the  dangers  of  a  contrary  ap-\nproach; the court attempted to decipher the “plain lan-\nguage” of translated regulations, overlooking that Chi-\nnese regulatory regimes rely heavily on other types of \nmaterial and use terms that might seem ambiguous or \neuphemistic  to  an  English-speaker  schooled  only  in \nAmerican law.  This misguided approach led the dis-\ntrict  court  to  accuse  the  Chinese  government  of  at-\ntempting  to  mislead  the  court,  understandably \nprompting a diplomatic protest. \n\nPetitioners  and  the  Solicitor  General  suggest  that \nforeign governments may mislead U.S. courts to pro-\ntect foreign interests, but they can identify no example \nof that happening in this Court or any other.  Notably, \nthe  Ministry  adhered  to  its  interpretation  here  even \nwhen the United States (among others) used the Min-\nistry’s  submissions  in  this  case  to  support  its  claims \nthat China’s trade practices violated WTO standards.  \nThat occurrence illustrates why foreign sovereigns are \nunlikely to espouse positions in U.S. courts they do not \nbelieve.  The positions they take here, in public filings, \nwill  have  consequences  in  domestic  settings  and \naround the world.",
        "5 \n\nDeference is also critical to international comity.  Re-\njecting a foreign sovereign’s explanation of its own law \ncan imply only two things: that a U.S. court knows a \ncountry’s laws better than its own government, or that \nthe foreign government is not being candid.  Both are \nprofoundly disrespectful.  The Court should not adopt \na rule that encourages litigants to accuse foreign gov-\nernments  of  incompetence  or  deceit,  and  encourages \ncourts  to  reject  foreign  sovereign’s  views  in  precisely \nthose cases that are important enough for them to par-\nticipate directly.   \n\nC.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 did not dis-\ncard the rule of deference to foreign sovereigns.  As the \nSolicitor  General  correctly  acknowledges,  there  is  no \nconflict  between  a  rule  of  deference  and  Rule  44.1’s \ntext.  Nor is there a conflict with Rule 44.1’s goals of \n(a)  making  foreign-law  determinations  questions  of \nlaw, not fact, and (b) removing limitations on the ma-\nterials  a  court  can  consider.    In  domestic  contexts, \ncourts  regularly  grant  deference  on  questions  of  law, \nand consider extrinsic materials in applying deference \ndoctrines.  So too here. \n\nAlthough the parties agree that domestic deference \ndoctrines  should  not  be  transplanted  wholesale  into \nthe  foreign-law  context,  analogies  may  be  illuminat-\ning. Like the Seventh Circuit, the Ministry believes it \nwould be inappropriate for courts to afford greater def-\nerence to executive-agency interpretations of domestic \nstatutes than to foreign government interpretations of \nforeign law. When U.S. courts decline to defer to a for-\neign sovereign’s interpretation of foreign law, they risk \napplying a rule that has never before existed and ap-\nplies to no one else, thereby imposing conflicting legal \nobligations on the parties before them.  And they risk \ninternational discord as a result.",
        "6 \n\nD.  The Solicitor General’s newly minted standard—\nin  which  any  number  of  “circumstances”  dictate  the \namount of deference due, if any—will not aid courts in \nresolving  difficult  issues  of  foreign  law,  and  will  not \nserve the interests of comity.  Indeed, although the So-\nlicitor General asserts that his approach will “ordinar-\nily”  afford  “substantial  weight”  to  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s interpretation, that assurance is impossible to \nsquare with his position that a court should resolve “a \ndisputed question of foreign law … in the same man-\nner  as  a  court  facing  any  other  unsettled  legal  ques-\ntion.”  The Court should not adopt that unprecedented \napproach. \n\nII.  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS  CORRECTLY \nDEFERRED TO THE MINISTRY’S REASON-\nABLE EXPLANATION OF CHINESE LAW. \n\nA.  The Second Circuit carefully examined the Min-\nistry’s submissions in context and in light of underly-\ning materials.  It also carefully explained the district \ncourt’s  key  analytical  errors—which  together  pro-\nduced a “nonsensical” reading of Chinese law.  Yet Pe-\ntitioners claim the Second Circuit blindly deferred to \nthe  Ministry  and  but  for  that  deference,  the  Second \nCircuit would have embraced the district court’s con-\nstruction.    That  is  a  strawman—the  Second  Circuit \nsaid nothing of the kind.   \n\nThe district court’s criticisms of the Ministry’s posi-\ntion were unfounded.  The Ministry provided a clear, \ndetailed, and cohesive interpretation of relevant Chi-\nnese  law.    The  district  court  appeared  troubled  that \naspects of the regulatory system were not fully spelled \nout in positive enactments, but that is typical of Chi-\nnese law.  Nor did the Ministry fail to distinguish be-\ntween the 1997 and 2002 regulatory regimes; rather, \nit carefully explained that the later regime rested on",
        "7 \n\nthe same basic concept as the earlier one, but was im-\nplemented differently. \n\nThe Ministry’s position here is also fully consistent \nwith  China’s  statements  to  the  WTO.    Those  state-\nments referred to the pre-2002 system of export quotas \nand licenses, but not to mechanisms such as the veri-\nfication-and-chop  system,  pursuant  to  which  (before \n2008) certain chambers of commerce were granted im-\nplementing authority to coordinate export prices, and \nthereby minimize export dumping issues that Chinese \nmanufacturers  might  encounter.    Indeed,  the  United \nStates later invoked the Ministry’s filings in this very \ncase to argue to the WTO that China controlled export \nprices  in  precisely  this  way,  including  during  the \n2002–2005 period, and the WTO agreed.  The district \ncourt simply misread China’s reference to “export ad-\nministration,”  giving  that  term  a  construction  never \nadopted by the trade specialists in the WTO proceed-\nings—an error Petitioners repeat here.  \n\nB.  There is no merit to the suggestion that the Min-\nistry lacks authority to interpret the regulatory mate-\nrials at issue.  In 2001, China’s State Council promul-\ngated rulemaking procedures that empower the Min-\nistry (and other Chinese agencies) to make and inter-\npret its own regulations.  The Ministry exercised that \nauthority  and,  moreover,  speaks  for  the  People’s  Re-\npublic of China here.",
        "8 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  U.S. COURTS ARE BOUND TO DEFER TO A \nFOREIGN  SOVEREIGN’S  REASONABLE \nEXPLANATION OF ITS OWN LAW. \n\nA.  Pink  Held  That  A  Foreign  Sovereign’s \nExplanation  Of  Its  Own  Law  Is  Conclu-\nsive. \n\nThis Court has already held, on materially indistin-\nguishable facts, that a foreign government’s explana-\ntion of its own law, provided for use in U.S. litigation, \nis “conclusive.” Pink, 315 U.S. at 218–20.  That hold-\ning, which the Second Circuit followed below, is fully \nsupported  by  other  decisions  of  this  Court  and  the \ncourts of appeals, and should be sustained. \n\n1.  Pink  held  that  an  official  Soviet  declaration  ex-\nplaining the “intended effect of the Russian decree na-\ntionalizing  [Russian]  insurance  companies”  after  the \nRussian  Revolution  was  “conclusive”  of  the  decree’s \nmeaning under Russian law.  Id. at 218–20 (footnote \nomitted).  As the Solicitor General previously told this \nCourt, Pink establishes that “[o]nce a foreign govern-\nment  presents  a  statement  dealing  with  subjects \nwithin  its  area  of  sovereign  authority …  American \ncourts  are  obligated  to  accept  that  statement  at  face \nvalue;  the  [foreign]  government’s  assertions  concern-\ning the existence and meaning of its domestic law gen-\nerally should be deemed ‘conclusive.’” Matsushita U.S. \nBr.  at  23  (quoting  Pink,  315  U.S.  at  220).    Only \n“[p]lainly ambiguous,” “internally inconsistent,” or fa-\ncially “incredible” assertions do not warrant deference.  \nId. \n\nThe Solicitor General has now flipped positions and, \nlike Petitioners, argues that Pink turned on “unusual” \nand distinguishable facts.  SG Br. 27–29; Pet. Br. 39–\n41.  They argue that (i) “a wealth of record evidence …",
        "9 \n\nconfirmed” the Soviet interpretation; (ii) the interpre-\ntation came “in response to an explicit invitation from \nthe  U.S.  Executive  Branch”;  and  (iii)  this  Court  first \nfound “that the Commissariat had power to interpret \nRussian law.”  Pet. Br. 41.  These claims are unavail-\ning. \n\nFirst,  Petitioners  and  the  Solicitor  General  misun-\nderstand the facts of Pink.  The New York courts had \nheld—based  on  expert  testimony,  government  docu-\nments,  court  decisions,  and  academic  writings,  see \nMoscow  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  Bank  of  N.Y.  &  Tr.  Co.,  294 \nN.Y.S. 648, 683 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1937)—that the nation-\nalization  decrees  “were  not  intended  to  have  effect \nhere.” Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of N.Y. & Tr. Co., \n20 N.E.2d 758, 767 (N.Y. 1939), aff’d by an equally di-\nvided court, 309 U.S. 624 (1940).  “Subsequently to the \nhearings in that case,” the United States obtained and \nsubmitted  the  official  Soviet  declaration.    Pink,  315 \nU.S. at 218.  When the issue arose again in Pink, on \nthe same record, id. at 216–17, this Court deemed the \ndeclaration “conclusive.”  It did so even though the dec-\nlaration  contradicted  the  New  York  courts’  holdings \nbased on “all the evidence in the voluminous record,” \nwhich this Court “d[id] not stop to review.”  Id. at 218. \n\nThus, Pink did not defer to the Soviet declaration be-\ncause it  was  supported  by  the  entire  record  (Pet. Br. \n41; SG Br. 10–11, 28–29); it deferred even though the \nlower courts thought the record, on balance, supported \nthe opposite conclusion. \n\nSecond,  although  U.S.  courts  previously  obtained \nforeign  legal  interpretations  “through  official  diplo-\nmatic channels” (SG Br. 28; Pet. Br. 41), that practice \nwas discontinued 40 years ago at this Court’s sugges-\ntion,  with  the  State  Department’s  concurrence.    See \nKristen E. Eichensehr, Foreign Sovereigns As Friends",
        "10 \n\nof the Court, 102 Va. L. Rev. 289, 299 (2016).  “[F]or-\neign  governments [now]  communicate  their  views  to \nthe  judicial  branch  through …  the  filing  of  formal \nbriefs,” id., as the Ministry did here.2  \n\n Moreover,  China  did  act  through  diplomatic  chan-\nnels.  After the district court ruled, the Chinese Em-\nbassy sent a diplomatic note to the State Department \nhighlighting  that  “China  has  attached  great  im-\nportance to this case” and reiterating that the Minis-\ntry’s  submissions  had  correctly  “described  China’s \ncompulsory  requirements  concerning  vitamin  C  ex-\nports.”    JA782–84.  That  note  was  before  the  Second \nCircuit, just as the Soviet declaration was before the \nNew York courts in Pink.  315 U.S. at 220. \n\nThird, Petitioners now contend (at 42–43) that Pink \nturned on a “threshold” finding that the Soviet decla-\nration  was  issued  pursuant  to  the  Commissariat’s \npower to interpret law, and that the Ministry has not \nshown equivalent authority here.  But insofar as the \nlower courts made no such formal finding, that is be-\ncause  Petitioners  never  raised  this  point  below.    See \nOBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 136 S. Ct. 390, 398 \n(2015) (“Absent unusual circumstances … we will not \nentertain  arguments  not  made  below.”).    Regardless, \nMOFCOM’s power to authoritatively interpret the reg-\nulatory materials at issue here is confirmed by the rec-\nord, by the diplomatic note, and by Chinese statutory \nlaw.  See infra p. 32.   \n\nThis case is on all fours with Pink. In both cases, a \nforeign governmental department issued a statement \nfor  use  in  U.S.  litigation  regarding  the  specific  issue \n\n2 Nor was the Soviet interpretation “akin to” a certified ques-\ntion to a state high court because it was obtained diplomatically.  \nSG Br. 28.  Certified questions are issued by courts; the Pink dec-\nlaration was obtained by the United States, a litigant.",
        "11 \n\nbeing litigated; its authority to speak on behalf of the \nforeign  nation  was  beyond  dispute;  and  there  was \nother  evidence  of  foreign  law  whose  import  was  dis-\nputed.  The Second Circuit correctly followed Pink by \ndeferring to the Ministry’s reasonable interpretation of \nthe rules that the Ministry and the relevant chamber \nof  commerce  (acting  under  the  Ministry’s  direction) \nmade, implemented, and enforced.   \n\n2.  Contrary to Petitioners’ (at 29) and the Solicitor \nGeneral’s (at 20–21) claims, Fremont v. United States \nfurther supports deference here.  58 U.S. (17 How.) 542 \n(1854).  Fremont concerned the validity of a claimant’s \ntitle to California land, arising from a pre-annexation \ngrant  by  the  Mexican  government.    The  court  noted \nthat  in  similar  cases  it  had  considered  a  variety  of \nsources  to  determine  foreign  law.    Id.  at  557.    There \nwas no question of deference because no official foreign \ninterpretation was proffered.  The Court emphasized, \nhowever, that it “could not, without doing injustice to \nindividuals,  give  to  the  Mexican laws a  more  narrow \nand  strict  construction  than  they  received  from  the \nMexican authorities who were intrusted with their exe-\ncution.”  Id. at 561 (emphasis added).  The Court thus \ndeclined to impose preconditions to the vesting of title \nthat Mexican “regulations for granting lands” seemed \nto require, because title “would have been regarded as \nvested and valid by the Mexican authorities” regard-\nless.  Id. at 561–62.  Fremont thus demonstrates this \nCourt’s  practice  of  accepting  a  foreign  government’s \nunderstanding of foreign law even where a U.S. court \nwriting on a blank slate might reach a different con-\nclusion. \n\n3.  This Court’s more recent decisions have similarly \nrelied  on  foreign  governments’  explanations  of  their \nown law.  In Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California,",
        "12 \n\nthis  Court  (while  disagreeing  with  the  United  King-\ndom’s  ultimate  policy  recommendation)  accepted  at \nface value the United Kingdom’s explanation of what \nBritish antitrust law did and did not require.  509 U.S. \n764, 798–99 (1993).  Similarly, JPMorgan Chase Bank \nv.  Traffic  Stream  (BVI)  Infrastructure  Ltd.  relied  on \n“the  United  Kingdom’s  own  filings”  and  diplomatic \nnotes to establish the “United Kingdom[’s] … author-\nity over the BVI’s statutory law,” and thus the citizen-\nship of BVI corporations.  536 U.S. 88, 96–97 (2002).  \nAnd Abbott v. Abbott relied on “a Chilean agency[’s]” \nexplanation to hold that Chilean law created a “joint” \nor  “shared”  right  to  determine  a  child’s  place  of  resi-\ndence.  560 U.S. 1, 10 (2010).   \n\nEven now, this Court has amicus briefs before it in \nUnited States v. Microsoft from several foreign author-\nities,  making  arguments  based  on  foreign  law.    E.g., \nEuropean  Commission  Br.  at  8–16,  United  States  v. \nMicrosoft, No. 17-2 (Dec. 13, 2017); U.K. Gov’t Br. at \n5–6, id.  These authorities are surely interested in the \ncase’s outcome and effects on their citizens.  But no one \nwould think these submissions should be disregarded \nbecause of those interests, or on the theory that U.S. \ncourts  better  understand  European  privacy  law  or \nBritish surveillance powers. \n\n4.  Though they have used varying formulations, the \ncourts  of  appeals  have  consistently  concluded  that \nstrong deference to appearing foreign sovereigns’ offi-\ncial interpretations of foreign law is warranted. \n\nIn In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz, France was a \nplaintiff seeking recovery from Amoco for a massive oil \nspill;  a  key  issue  was  whether  a  French  statute  im-\nposed liability for the clean-up costs at issue.  954 F.2d \n1279,  1289,  1311  (7th  Cir.  1992)  (per  curiam).    The \nstatute  was  not  clear,  and  “[e]ach  side  presented  an \nexpert of the highest skill and repute.”  Id. at 1312.  It",
        "13 \n\nwas  enough,  however,  that  France’s  interpretation \nwas  “plausible”:  “A  court  of  the  United  States  owes \nsubstantial  deference  to  the  construction  France \nplaces on its domestic law.”  Id.  The Seventh Circuit \nthus  declined  to  “decide  whether  [France’s]  under-\nstanding of the law is correct,” and deferred to it.  Id. \n\nIn Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications \nCorp., the Fifth Circuit generally embraced Amoco Ca-\ndiz’s approach.  197 F.3d 694, 714 (5th Cir. 1999).  It \nnonetheless declined to follow the guidance stated in a \nMexican  government  circular  because  the  Mexican \nagency was “not before the court”; its interpretive au-\nthority was unclear; and “[m]ore importantly” the cir-\ncular pre-dated a significant change in law.  Id.   \n\nIn  Richmark  Corp.  v.  Timber  Falling  Consultants, \nthe defendant, a company incorporated in China and \n“an  arm  of  the  PRC  government,”  resisted  discovery \nbecause  its  financial  information  “was  classified  a \nstate secret.”  959 F.2d 1468, 1471–72 (9th Cir. 1992).  \nThe  company  produced  a  letter  from  the  “arm  of  the \nState  Council …  in  charge  of  overseeing  [its]  opera-\ntions” confirming this interpretation.  Id. at 1472.  The \nNinth Circuit “accept[ed] as valid the [Chinese] letter \ninterpreting the State Secrets Act,” explaining that a \nU.S. court has “neither the power nor the expertise to \ndetermine for ourselves what PRC law is.”  Id. at 1474 \n& n.7.  The court then balanced China’s “admitted in-\nterest  in  secrecy”  against  the  plaintiffs’  interests  in \ndisclosure to determine whether discovery was appro-\npriate under U.S. law.  Id. at 1474. \n\nUnited States v. McNab, which Petitioners and the \nSolicitor  General  invoke,  is  more  about  finality  than \ndeference.    331  F.3d  1228  (11th  Cir.  2003).    The  de-\nfendants were prosecuted under the Lacey Act for im-\nporting  lobsters  taken  in  violation  of  Honduran  law.  \nId. at 1232.  “Throughout the investigation and trial …",
        "14 \n\ninterpretation:   \n\ninitial \n\nboth the government and the district court relied upon \nthe  Honduran  officials’  verification  of  the  Honduran \nlaws.”  Id.  The Eleventh Circuit said the district court \ncorrectly  deferred  to  that \n“Among the most logical sources for the court to look \nto  in  its  determination  of  foreign  law  are  the  foreign \nofficials charged with enforcing the laws of their coun-\ntry.…  The  court  reasonably  may  assume  that  state-\nments from foreign officials are a reliable and accurate \nsource ….”  Id. at 1241.  On appeal, however, Hondu-\nras  filed  a  brief that  the  panel  majority  described  as \nasserting for the first time that the Honduran regula-\ntions were invalid or had been retroactively repealed.  \nId. at 1240 & n.23.3  The court declined to upset the \nconvictions on this basis, ruling that it would not sub-\nstitute  deference  for  the  first  opinion  with  deference \nfor  the  second  because  there  “must  be  some  finality \nwith  representations  of  foreign  law.”    Id.  at  1241  & \nn.25.  Here, the Ministry’s position has never varied. \n\nIn McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran \n(Pet. Br. 32; SG Br. 19), no instrumentality of the Ira-\nnian  government  offered  an  official  interpretation  of \nIranian  law,  and  deference  was  never  invoked.    271 \nF.3d  1101  (D.C.  Cir.  2001).    Rather,  the  meaning  of \nIranian  law  was  litigated  through  expert  testimony.  \nId. at 1108–09.  Thus, when the D.C. Circuit concluded \nthat  Iran’s  evidence  did  not  establish  the  categorical \nlegal rule Iran’s U.S. counsel asserted, it was not re-\nfusing to defer to an  official interpretation; it merely \nrefused to credit a party’s experts.  Id. at 1109; see Pet. \nfor  Certiorari  at  24–25,  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran  v. \nMcKesson  HBOC,  Inc.,  537  U.S.  941  (2002)  (No.  01-\n\n3 A dissent contended that the appellate amicus brief was the \nonly  official  governmental  statement  presented.    331  F.3d  at \n1247.",
        "15 \n\n1521)  (arguing  Iran  was  entitled  to  summary  judg-\nment  because  its  experts’  “affidavits  and  legal  opin-\nions” were “unrebutted”). \n\nB.  Deference  Serves  The  Interests  of  Accu-\n\nracy and International Comity. \n\nDeference serves two crucial values:  (1) it enhances \nthe accuracy of the resulting legal determination, and \n(2)  it  furthers  international  comity.    And  deference \ndoes  not  surrender  U.S.  prerogatives  to  foreign  na-\ntions.    As  Pink  emphasized,  whether  foreign  law \nshould supply all or part of the rule of decision is a do-\nmestic-law  matter.    315  U.S.  at  221.    The  United \nStates  is  free,  for  example,  to  establish  endangered-\nspecies protections that do not incorporate foreign law. \nCf. McNab, 331 F.3d at 1236.  But where the laws of \nthe  United  States  do  incorporate  foreign-law  stand-\nards,  its  courts  should  defer,  in  all  but  the  most  ex-\ntraordinary  cases,  to  a  foreign  sovereign’s  official  in-\nterpretation of those standards.     \n\n1.  Deference  enhances  accuracy.    U.S.  judges  are \n“likely to miss nuances in the foreign law, to fail to ap-\npreciate  the  way  in  which  one  branch  of  the  other \ncountry’s law interacts with another, or to assume er-\nroneously that the foreign law mirrors U.S. law when \nit does not.” Bodum USA, Inc. v. La Cafetiere, Inc., 621 \nF.3d  624,  638–39  (7th  Cir.  2010)  (Wood,  J.,  concur-\nring).  Some foreign laws will be the subject of analysis \nand  explanation  in  English-language  materials,  but \nmany  others  will  not.    Parties  can  offer  expert  testi-\nmony, but that is expensive and often “adds an adver-\nsary’s spin.”  Id. at 629 (majority op.).  It is thus “logi-\ncal” to defer to a foreign sovereign’s statements, which \na “court reasonably may assume … are a reliable and \naccurate source.” McNab, 331 F.3d at 1241. And defer-\nence is “particularly important” where there are “stark",
        "16 \n\ndifferences”  between  the  foreign  and  U.S.  legal  sys-\ntems.  Pet. App. 29a. \n\nPetitioners repeatedly invoke the need for accuracy \n(at 27–33), but ignore the risk that a weak or indeter-\nminate deference rule will leave U.S. judges prone to \nfall back on familiar American legal doctrines or intu-\nitions  that  may  be  an  unreliable  compass  in  foreign \nwaters.  See Bader v. Kramer, 484 F.3d 666, 670 (4th \nCir. 2007) (reliance on the “plain and ordinary mean-\ning” of foreign law is “problematic” because it can pro-\nduce a conclusion “divorced from that term’s meaning \nin the law of the [foreign] country”); Whallon v. Lynn, \n230 F.3d 450, 456 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Care must be taken \nto  avoid  imposing  American  legal  concepts  onto  an-\nother legal culture.”).   \n\nThe  district  court’s  analysis  here  illustrates  these \nperils.    The  “Chinese  legal-  and  economic-regulatory \nsystem” is “unique and complex”:  “[T]he Chinese gov-\nernment [] frequently governs by regulations promul-\ngated by various ministries”; “private citizens or com-\npanies may be authorized under  Chinese regulations \nto act in certain circumstances as government agents”; \nand  “an  interpretation  suggested  by  the  plain  lan-\nguage of a governmental directive may not accurately \nreflect Chinese law.”  Pet. App. 29a (omission in origi-\nnal).  And Petitioners offered no expert evidence sup-\nporting their interpretation.  Id. at 59a n.5.  \n\nThe district court thus embarked on a solo mission \nto interpret the Chinese regulatory regime.  It rejected \nthe expert testimony offered by Respondents, and de-\nclined to hear argument from any party at summary \njudgment.  It then pursued a “plain language” review \nof Chinese law, Pet. App. 97a, without asking whether \na  Chinese  lawyer  would  do  the  same.    It  relied  on  a \nseries of unsupported assumptions about whether and",
        "17 \n\nhow Chinese law could “compel[]” anticompetitive con-\nduct, which the court of appeals correctly rejected as \nillogical.  Id. at 30a–32a.  This analysis led the court \nto  accuse  the  Chinese  government  of  intentional  de-\nception.  Id. at 120–21a (“The 2009 Statement does not \nread  like  a  frank  and  straightforward  explanation  of \nChinese  law.…  [T]he  Ministry’s  assertion  of  compul-\nsion is a post-hoc attempt to shield defendants’ conduct \nfrom antitrust scrutiny”). There was nothing “respect-\nful” (Pet. Br. 4) about this approach, and nothing reli-\nable about it either. \n\nPetitioners say (at 34–35) it is “incoherent” to afford \ngreater  deference  when  a  foreign  sovereign  actually \nappears before a U.S. court.  The courts of appeals dis-\nagree. Compare Amoco Cadiz, 954 F.2d at 1312 (defer-\nence is owed even if “the interpretation may occur in \n(or in anticipation of) litigation”), with Access Telecom, \n197 F.3d at 714 (no deference where, inter alia, Mexi-\ncan  agency  was  “not  before  the  court”).    So  does  the \nSolicitor  General,  who  acknowledges  that  a  foreign \ngovernment’s  direct  participation  ensures  that  the \ncourt receives an interpretation grounded in the spe-\ncific context of the dispute.  SG Br. 25.  And participa-\ntion permits the court to engage directly with counsel \nfor  the  foreign  sovereign,  including  by  posing  ques-\ntions at oral argument.4   \n\nPetitioners and their amici raise the specter of a for-\neign sovereign misleading a U.S. court to protect for-\neign interests (Pet. Br. 36; SG Br. 25), but they cannot \n\n4 The  Solicitor  General  says  (at  24)  the  Second  Circuit’s  de-\nscription  of  the  Ministry’s  submission  as  “a  sworn  evidentiary \nproffer” was “inapt,” but the Ministry submitted a sworn declara-\ntion  authenticating  the  underlying  materials.    Regardless, \nwhether  a  foreign  submission  is  “sworn”  is  not  decisive;  what \nmatters is whether it presents an official, authoritative interpre-\ntation.",
        "18 \n\nidentify  any  instance  of  this  happening  even  though \ndecisions  like  Pink  and  Amoco  Cadiz  have  long  been \non the books.  Little wonder. Foreign governments are \nnot  frequently  parties  in  U.S.  courts,  and  when  they \nare, U.S. law usually predominates, cf. RJR Nabisco v. \nEuropean Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090 (2016), even if foreign \nlaw  plays  some  role,  e.g.,  Amoco  Cadiz,  954  F.2d  at \n1289.   \n\nMoreover,  foreign  governments  have  strong  incen-\ntives  to  accurately  explain  their  laws  to  U.S.  courts.  \nBecause U.S. court filings are public, foreign govern-\nments know their statements will endure beyond the \ncase  at  hand,  and  may  have  ramifications  in  their \nhome courts or international tribunals.  This very case \nprovides an exemplar:  The United States (along with \nthe European Union and Mexico) cited the Ministry’s \nfilings as supporting a WTO complaint against China.  \nInfra p. 30.  And if a foreign government were ever to \noffer  a  facially  incredible, inconsistent,  or wholly  un-\nsupported  interpretation,  neither  Pink  nor  the  deci-\nsion below would require deference.  Pet. App. 25a & \nn.8; supra p. 8. \n\n2.  Deference  also  serves  important  international \ncomity  principles.    As  just  explained,  deference  rests \non the premise that foreign sovereigns will accurately \ndescribe their law to U.S. courts.  The Court should not \nadopt  a  rule  that  encourages  lower  courts  to  decide \n“whether the representation of consuls, ambassadors, \nand other representatives of foreign nations is credible \nor made in good faith.”  Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. \n429,  434  (1968)  (cautioning  against  such  inquiries). \nForeign sovereigns will have little interest in partici-\npating in U.S. litigation if their motives inevitably will \nbe  demeaned.  The  result  of  adopting  Petitioners’ \nstandard  would  be  to  deprive  the  courts  of  valuable",
        "19 \n\nguidance in many cases, and to create needless inter-\nnational friction in others. \n\nThe  Solicitor  General  disputes  that  these  conse-\nquences will follow, since “reject[ing] a foreign govern-\nment’s characterization of its laws does not thereby ac-\ncuse  the  foreign  government  of  misrepresenting  the \npertinent  facts.”    SG  Br.  24  (emphasis  added).    But \nsuch  a  rejection  necessarily  implies  that  the  foreign \ngovernment  is  either  misrepresenting  the  pertinent \nlaw or is so ignorant of its law that an American judge \nknows better. Neither suggestion promotes comity.  Cf. \nBr.  for  Australia,  Canada,  and  United  Kingdom  as \nAmicus Curiae at 9–10, Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574 (urg-\ning that ignoring Pink and allowing a U.S. court to ad-\njudicate  the  veracity  of  a  foreign  sovereign’s  legal \nstatement  “would  be  an  unacceptable  intrusion  into \n[its] sovereignty”). \n\n3.  Some amici contend that strong deference would \n“distort” the “holistic balancing” test this Court has ap-\nplied to determine the effect of foreign law in a variety \nof contexts.  E.g., U.S. Chamber of Commerce Br. 3, 11; \nsee also Am. Antitrust Inst. Br. 4.  These arguments \nconfuse two separate issues: (a) how to determine the \ncontent of foreign law; and (b) once that content is de-\ntermined, what effect foreign law should have in U.S. \ncourts.  See Pink, 315 U.S. at 220–21 (explaining that \nthese  are  “distinct  matter[s]”).    The  latter  question, \nemphasized by these amici, is beyond the scope of the \nquestion  presented.    Likewise,  the  “weighty  separa-\ntion-of-powers  concerns”  in  Pink  (Pet.  Br.  41)  influ-\nenced the analysis of whether U.S. courts should give",
        "20 \n\neffect to the Russian decree, not the antecedent deter-\nmination of its Russian-law meaning.  315 U.S. at 221–\n34.5 \n\nHere, after properly deferring to the Ministry’s sub-\nmissions,  the  Second  Circuit  turned  to  Sherman  Act \nprecedents to  decide  whether dismissal was required \nas  a  matter  of  comity.    Pet.  App.  12a–18a,  33a–38a. \nThe court’s answer was yes, and this Court declined to \nreview whether comity is an appropriate basis to dis-\nmiss a Sherman Act claim.  Pet. i.  Thus, U.S. law ul-\ntimately controlled this case by determining the effect \nof Chinese law on the outcome. \n\nC.  Neither  Rule  44.1  Nor  Domestic  Defer-\n\nence Doctrines Are Relevant Here. \n\n1.  Petitioners and  the  Solicitor  General  spill  much \nink  arguing  that  the  decision  below—and  Pink,  for \nthat matter—is inconsistent with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 44.1.  Not so.  Rule 44.1 provides that “[i]n \ndetermining  foreign  law,  the  court  may  consider  any \nrelevant  material  or  source,”  and  the  resulting  deci-\nsion is “a ruling on a question of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n44.1.    As  the  Solicitor  General  concedes  (at  17),  the \nRule  says  nothing  about  deference  to  foreign  sover-\neigns or the scope of a court’s discretion in reaching a \nsubstantive determination of foreign law.  Contra Pet. \nBr. 31, 33.  And there is no suggestion that the Rules \n\n5 Thus, First National City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Ex-\nterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611 (1983), does not counsel against def-\nerence.    Contra  U.S.  Chamber  Br.  12–13.    There,  the  Court  ac-\ncepted that a Cuban bank was “a separate and distinct juridical \nentity” from the Cuban government under Cuban law, but applied \ninternational and U.S. law to determine “the effect to be given to \nBancec’s separate juridical status” for FSIA purposes.  462 U.S. \nat 616 n.3, 619, 621.  As in Pink, the Court accepted that Cuban \nlaw had the meaning asserted by Cuban officials, and looked to \nU.S. law to determine the effect of that foreign-law conclusion.",
        "21 \n\nCommittee intended to alter or abrogate Pink in any \nway.  The Second Circuit rightly found no conflict be-\ntween Rule 44.1’s procedures for determining foreign \nlaw  and  Pink’s  rule  of  deference.    Pet.  App.  22a;  cf. \nPink,  315  U.S.  at  220–21  &  nn.4–5  (applying  New \nYork’s procedural rules on how a court may receive ev-\nidence of foreign law). \n\nNor  is  there  any  conflict  between  Pink’s  deference \nrule  and  Rule  44.1’s  purposes  of  (i)  establishing  that \nforeign law’s meaning is a question of law, not fact, and \n(ii) removing limitations on the materials a court may \nconsider.  See Pet. Br. 28, 30–31; SG Br. 14–16.  The \n“interpretation” of a federal statute is equally “a ques-\ntion of law,”  McDermott  Int’l,  Inc.  v.  Wilander,  498 \nU.S. 337, 356 (1991), and yet courts routinely defer to \nagency  interpretations  of  those  statutes,  Encino  Mo-\ntorcars,  LLC  v.  Navarro,  136  S. Ct.  2117,  2124–25 \n(2016).  And the Second Circuit made clear that Pink’s \ndeference rule does not prevent a court from consider-\ning “any relevant material or source.”  Pet. App. 12a, \n22a (emphasis added); see Pink, 315 U.S. at 221 & n.5.   \n\n2.  The parties generally agree that domestic defer-\nence doctrines do not govern here.6  SG Br. 19–20; Pet. \nBr. 47–55; Resp. Br. 31–32.  But Petitioners draw the \nwrong lesson from that fact, arguing there is no basis \nto  “privileg[e]  the  representations  of  foreign  govern-\nments” over those of domestic government bodies.  Pet. \nBr.  47–48.    That  overlooks  critical  differences.    U.S. \ncourts lack the expertise to decipher foreign law, and \nthus risk reaching an erroneous interpretation that—\nbecause it does not actually alter foreign law in non-\nU.S.  applications—imposes  inconsistent  legal  obliga-\ntions on regulated parties.  See Richmark, 959 F.2d at \n\n6 Petitioners’  lengthy  argument  (at  48–55)  that  “the  Chevron \ndoctrine cannot be sensibly applied” here is thus beside the point.",
        "22 \n\n1474 n.7 (court has no “power [ ]or … expertise to de-\ntermine for ourselves what PRC law is”).  Nor can such \nan  error  be  rectified  through  remand  to  a  domestic \nagency or congressional intervention.   \n\nAnother telling difference is that a court’s refusal to \ndefer to a federal or state agency will not cause an in-\nternational  incident.    Rejecting  a  foreign  sovereign’s \ninterpretation of foreign law can have just that result.  \nThe  Chinese  Government  has  already  protested  the \ndistrict court’s disrespectful treatment of the Ministry \nin this case.  JA782–84.  Deference here is thus sup-\nported by comity concerns that simply do not exist in \nthe  domestic  arena.    See  Amoco  Cadiz,  954  F.2d  at \n1312  (“Giving  the  conclusions  of  a  sovereign  nation \nless respect than those of an administrative agency is \nunacceptable.”). \n\nD.  The Solicitor General’s Position Is Hope-\n\nlessly Indeterminate. \n\nSince abandoning its recognition that Pink provides \nthe standard of deference here, supra p. 8, the United \nStates has searched in vain for a clear and consistent \nposition.  Although the Solicitor General now says (at \n19)  that  domestic-deference  “analogies  are  generally \nunhelpful,”  the  Government  argued  in  McNab  that \nSkidmore deference was the proper “analog[ue].”  Brief \nin  Opposition  at  17–18,  McNab  v.  United States, No. \n03-622 (Dec. 29, 2003) (McNab Opp.); but see SG Br. \n21 n.3.  At the certiorari stage in this case, the Govern-\nment  accepted  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  formulation \nwas  “not  necessarily …  problematic.”    Br.  for  United \nStates as Amicus Curiae at 9.  Now the Solicitor Gen-\neral  attacks  the  Second  Circuit’s  “rigid”  standard  (at \n22), but declines to offer any “formula or rule” for def-\nerence.  He instead posits numerous (non-exhaustive) \n“circumstances” that are “relevant,” suggests “the ap-",
        "23 \n\npropriate weight in each case will depend on the cir-\ncumstances,” and opines that a court should resolve “a \ndisputed question of foreign law … in the same man-\nner  as  a  court  facing  any  other  unsettled  legal  ques-\ntion.” SG Br. 9, 16, 19–20, 21; see also Pet. Br. 54–55.   \n\nThe  Court  should  reject  this  invitation  to  overturn \nevery extant standard and leave the lower courts with \nnone. “[O]pen-ended balancing tests[ ] can yield unpre-\ndictable and at times arbitrary results,” Lexmark Int’l, \nInc.  v.  Static  Control  Components,  Inc.,  134  S. Ct. \n1377, 1392 (2014), and that caution is clearly apt here.  \nNever before have U.S. courts reviewed de novo a for-\neign sovereign’s interpretation of its own laws.  Never \nbefore has that been thought desirable. That standard \nwould not mirror past practice, and it would not mirror \ninternational practice, under which, for example, “any \n[WTO] Member can reasonably expect that considera-\nble deference be given to its views on the meaning of \nits own law.”7  And it is a recipe for chaos and unfair \nsurprise—one-off judicial decisions that do not reflect \nthe  actual  law  of  any  foreign  jurisdiction,  impose  in-\nconsistent  legal  obligations  on  private  parties,  and \ngive rise to unwarranted diplomatic friction.  \n\nThere  is  no  need  for  such  experimentation.    Pink \nheld long ago that a foreign sovereign’s reasonable ex-\nplanation  of  its  own  law  is  conclusive  of  the  foreign-\nlaw  question.    That  rule  is  workable,  supported  by \nstrong  policy  considerations,  consistent  with  long-\n\n7 Panel Report, United States – Sections 301-310 of the Trade \nAct  of  1974,  WTO  Doc.  WT/DS152/R  ¶ 7.19  (adopted  Jan.  27, \n2000),  https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/wtds152r. \npdf.  The United States  advocates this  “considerable deference” \nstandard in its own WTO submissions.  E.g., Second Written Sub-\nmission of the United States, United States – Section 129(c)(1) of \nthe  Uruguay  Round  Agreements  Act,  WT/DS221,  at  3  (Mar.  8, \n2002), https://goo.gl/bnBYdN.",
        "24 \n\nstanding  practice,  and  unaffected  by  Rule  44.1.    The \nSecond Circuit’s holding was correct. \n\nII.  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS  CORRECTLY \nDEFERRED TO THE MINISTRY’S REASON-\nABLE  INTERPRETATION  OF  CHINESE \nLAW. \n\nA.  The Second Circuit Properly Determined \nThat The Ministry’s Explanation Of Chi-\nnese Law Was Reasonable. \n\n1.  Petitioners paint the Second Circuit’s standard as \nrequiring  blind  deference  to  foreign  sovereign  inter-\npretations in all cases and without regard to other ev-\nidence.  Pet. Br. 22–23, 26; see SG Br. 22.  Not so.  The \nSecond Circuit recognized that it could “consider any \nrelevant material or source, including the legal author-\nities supplied by the parties on appeal.” Pet. App. 12a.  \nEven after receiving a foreign sovereign’s submission, \na court “must still evaluate the relevant source mate-\nrial  within  the  context  of  each  case.”    Id.  at  23a.    If \n“there is no documentary evidence or reference of law \nproffered  to  support  a  foreign  sovereign’s  interpreta-\ntion of its own laws, deference may be inappropriate.”  \nId. at 25a n.8; see SG Br. 22 n.4.  At bottom, deference \nis proper only if the foreign sovereign’s explanation is \n“reasonable under the circumstances.”  Pet. App. 25a.  \nThat is a sound and fair restatement of Pink’s holding. \n\n2.  In  applying  this  standard,  the  Second  Circuit \npaid “careful attention” to the Chinese regulations at \nissue and the facts surrounding their application.  Pet. \nApp.  27a–33a.    In  particular,  it  observed  that,  “[t]he \n2002 Notice, inter alia, demonstrates that  from 2002 \nto 2005 … Chinese law required Defendants to partic-\nipate  in  the  PVC  regime  in  order  to  export  vitamin \nC.   This  regulatory  regime  allowed  vitamin  C  manu-",
        "25 \n\nfacturers the export only of vitamin C subject to con-\ntracts  that  complied  with  the  ‘industry-wide  negoti-\nated’ price.”  Id. at 27a.  The court said that, by itself, \nthe term “industry-wide negotiated” might be ambigu-\nous, but pointed out that it would be “nonsensical” to \nrequire regulated parties to comply with such a “mini-\nmum  price  point  if  there  were  no  directive  to  agree \nupon such a price”; the court thus found reasonable the \nMinistry’s explanation that “members of the regulated \nindustry were required to negotiate and agree upon a \nprice.”  Id. at 27a–28a.   \n\nThe court similarly observed that “on their face the \nterms ‘industry self-discipline,’ ‘coordination,’ and ‘vol-\nuntary restraint’” could imply a lack of compulsion, but \naccepted  as  reasonable  the  statement  that  setting \nprices was mandatory, in light of the underlying mate-\nrials and the Ministry’s explanation of the trade regu-\nlations it had adopted.  See Pet. App. 28a (Second Cir-\ncuit stating that “these are terms of art within Chinese \nlaw connoting the government’s expectation that pri-\nvate actors actively self-regulate to achieve the govern-\nment’s  policy  goals”);  JA138,  248–49.    It  was  in  this \ncontext that the Second Circuit said a “court [must] not \nembark on a challenge to a foreign government’s offi-\ncial  representation  to  the  court  regarding  its  laws  or \nregulations, even if that representation is inconsistent \nwith  how  those  laws  might  be  interpreted  under  the \nprinciples of our legal system.”  Pet. App. 26a (empha-\nsis  added);  SG  Br.  22  (omitting  the  italicized  lan-\nguage); Pet. Br. 50 (same).  The point was not that a \ncourt must close its eyes to extrinsic materials; it was \nthat a U.S. court must remain keenly aware of its own \nlimitations as a foreign-law interpreter. \n\nThe Second Circuit then highlighted three key errors \ncommitted  by  the  district  court.  “First,  [the  district",
        "26 \n\ncourt]  determined  that  whether  Chinese  law  com-\npelled Defendants’ anticompetitive conduct depended \nin part on whether Defendants petitioned the Chinese \nGovernment  to  approve  and  sanction  such  conduct.”  \nPet.  App.  30a. This  was  error  because  the reason  for \nthe  Chinese  legal  requirements  is  both  irrelevant  to \ntheir  existence  and  cannot  be  questioned  under  the \nact-of-state doctrine.  Id. at 31a.  “Second, it relied on \nevidence  that  China’s  price-fixing  laws  were  not  en-\nforced  to  conclude  that  China’s  price  fixing  laws  did \nnot exist.”  Id. at 30a.  This too was error, because it \n“confuses  the  question  of  what  Chinese  law  required \nwith  whether  the  vitamin  C  regulations  were  en-\nforced.”  Id. at 32a.8  “And third, it determined that if \nChinese law did not compel the exact anticompetitive \nconduct  alleged  in  the  complaint,  then  there  was  no \ntrue conflict.”  Id. at 30a.  In fact, a true conflict exists \nwhenever it is impossible to comply with both nations’ \nlaws, which is the case here.  Id. at 32a–33a. \n\n3.  Petitioners do not attempt to defend these errors.  \nThey ignore them, and instead quote—five times—the \nSecond  Circuit’s  observation  that,  had  the  Ministry \nnot appeared in the litigation, the district court’s ap-\nproach  “would  have  been  entirely  appropriate.”    Pet. \nApp. 30a n.10.  Petitioners attempt to spin this into a \n“concession”  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  decision  was \n“[b]ased  solely  on  the  standard  of  ‘binding  deference’ \n\n8 The  Second  Circuit  was  clearly  correct.    We  do  not  decide \nwhether  theft  is  prohibited  by  counting  shoplifting  incidents. \nStealing is illegal, yet it occurs frequently.  Contra Pet. Br. 10–\n11.  Indeed, Petitioners quote the head of the Vitamin C Subcom-\nmittee  urging  “government  departments  to  assist  chambers  of \ncommerce in asserting their authority, so that [the chambers] can \npunish [noncompliant] companies.”  Id. at 12 (first alteration in \noriginal).  This shows not that compulsion was absent, but that \nenforcement was challenging.",
        "27 \n\nthat it imposed.” Pet. Br. 58–59.  Not so.  The Second \nCircuit  determined  correctly  that  the  district  court \nadopted a “nonsensical” interpretation of Chinese law. \nIt simply noted hypothetically that if the Ministry had \nnot  appeared,  the  district  court’s  approach  of  “at-\ntempt[ing] to parse … China’s complex vitamin C mar-\nket regulatory framework” would have been “appropri-\nate.”  Pet. App. 29a–30a & n.10.  The district court’s \nerroneous conclusions received no blessing.  \n\n4.  The district court also offered misguided reasons \n\nfor rejecting the Ministry’s interpretation. \n\nFirst, the district court criticized the Ministry’s 2009 \nstatement  as  “undeserving  of  deference”  because  the \ncourt believed it lacked citations.  Pet. App. 119a–20a.  \nBut the 2009 statement expressly invoked and reiter-\nated the arguments in the Ministry’s two prior submis-\nsions, JA247–48, which provided much of the specific \ncitation to Chinese law that the district court appeared \nto seek, Pet. App. 189a–223a; JA131–33.   \n\nSecond,  the  district  court  said  the  2009  statement \ncontained  “ambiguous  terms  and  phrases,”  Pet.  App. \n120a, particularly as to the meaning and consequences \nof  non-compliance  with  “self-discipline,”  id.  at  132a–\n33a.    Both  the  Ministry  and  Respondents’  expert  ex-\nplained these points, and the district court’s desire to \nsee them spelled out in “a published series of specific \nconduct-dictating prohibitions or compulsions with an \nidentified sanctions system,” Pet. App. 116a, was un-\nrealistic.  In China, as in the United States, not all im-\nportant legal concepts are set forth in positive enact-\nments; for example, what statute would an American \nlawyer cite to prove the existence of non-retroactivity \nor qualified immunity? \n\nThird,  the  district  court  said  the  Ministry’s  2009 \nstatement failed to “distinguish between” the 1997 and",
        "28 \n\n2002  regulatory  regimes,  Pet.  App.  120a,  a  criticism \nPetitioners reprise here (at 14–15).  But the Ministry’s \namicus  brief—which  contained  separate  sections  de-\nscribing  the  1997  “Initial  Regulations”  and  the  2002 \n“Revised  Regulation[s]”—made  clear  that  the  2002 \namendments  “changed  the  way  in  which  compliance \nwith  the  [Chamber  of  Commerce  of  Medicines  & \nHealth  Products  Importers  &  Exporters’]  ‘coordina-\ntion’ was confirmed.”  Pet. App. 203a, 208a.  Under the \nnew  price-verification-and-chop  system,  or  PVC,  the \nChamber verified each manufacturer’s “contract price \nand volume”:  “If the price was at or above the mini-\nmum acceptable price set by coordination through the \nChamber, the Chamber affixed a special seal, known \nas a ‘chop,’ on the contract and returned it to the man-\nufacturer.”  Id. at 208a–09a.  Export was allowed “only \nif the contract bore the Chamber’s ‘chop’”; noncompli-\nance thus meant “denial by Customs of the ability to \nexport.”  Id. at 209a.9 \n\nAs before, the 2002 regime was adopted to “promote \nindustry self-discipline,” now based on “industry-wide \nnegotiated prices for those export products subject to \nprice review.”  JA99–100; see Pet. App. 208a.  It was \nthus  based  on  the  same  basic  concept  as  before,  but \nimplemented  differently.    Petitioners  make  much  of \nthe  fact  that  the  1997  Charter’s  requirement  to \n“[s]trictly  execute”  the  coordinated  price  was  “abol-\nished”  (Pet.  Br.  15  (alteration  in  original)  (emphasis \nomitted)),  but  neglect  to  mention  the  “resolution” \nadopted at a Chamber-led meeting in late 2001 that, \nunder the PVC regime, “[t]he committed export volume \nas  part  of  the  industry  self-discipline  shall  be  strictly \n\n9 Amici Howson and Clarke suggest (at 21) that Customs might \nhave refused to enforce a regime established by Ministry regula-\ntions  alone, but ignore that  the 2002 Notice issued jointly from \nboth departments, JA99.",
        "29 \n\nimplemented.”  JA459.  Non-compliant exporters “will \nbe punished.”  Id. \n\nFurther, Petitioners’ explanation of the 2002 regime \nmakes no sense.  Petitioners urge the same “nonsensi-\ncal”  view  the  Second  Circuit  rejected:    That  even \nthough the PVC regime permitted export only “if the \ncontract met or exceeded an industry-determined min-\nimum export price,” it allowed manufacturers to “opt-\nout” and “did not prohibit exports in the event that [the \nindustry]  declined  to  reach  a  price  agreement  in  the \nfirst place.”  Pet. Br. 8–9.  Such a regulatory program \nwould be pointless.  Pet. App. 27a–28a.  And the sup-\nposed “opt-out” provision does not say what Petitioners \nclaim:    It  permits  the  suspension  of  price  review  by \n“the customs and chambers,” not by individual manu-\nfacturers.  JA100.  There is no allegation that the reg-\nulators ever exercised this authority.  Nor could man-\nufacturers “opt-out” by resigning from the subcommit-\ntee (Pet. Br. 8–9); non-members were also bound to fol-\nlow  the  industry-wide  negotiated  prices  because  fail-\nure  to  do  so  would  result  in  the  denial  of  a  chop.  \nJA105–06. \n\nPetitioners’ reliance on the supposed plain language \nof the 2002 documents is, like the district court’s, mis-\nplaced:  Petitioners simply assume that Chinese terms \nwhich translate as, e.g., “voluntary,” mean what they \nwould mean to a U.S. lawyer.  E.g., Pet. Br. 7, 9.  These \nmisguided assumptions are not a sound basis to reject \nthe  Chinese  government’s  official  explanation  (sup-\nported by expert testimony) of what these terms actu-\nally mean.  E.g., JA139 (Chinese legal expert explain-\ning:    “In  no  way  was  participation  in  the  process … \n‘voluntary’ in the sense that it could be ignored.”). \n\nFourth,  the  district  court  said,  and  Petitioners  ar-\ngue,  that  the  Ministry’s  position  here  is  inconsistent \nwith China’s statements to the WTO that it “gave up",
        "30 \n\n‘export administration … of vitamin C’ as of January \n1,  2002.”    Pet.  App.  120a–21a  (omission  in  original); \nPet. Br. 9, 19, 21, 53.  This view reflects the same mis-\nunderstanding as above:  The “export administration” \nChina gave up was not the policy of industrial self-dis-\ncipline  that  required  price  and  output  coordination, \nbut  rather—as  the  WTO  later  found—the  system  of \n“export quotas and licences” for Vitamin C that China \nhad followed until 2002.  WTO, Trade Policy Review: \nPeople’s Republic of China, WT/TPR/S/161, ¶ 141 (Feb. \n28,  2006),  https://goo.gl/iPtMaZ.10    The  2002  Notice \nthus explained that, “in order to accommodate the new \nsituations  since  China’s  entry  into  WTO”  while  still \n“promot[ing] industry self-discipline,” certain products \nwere “no longer subject to supervision and review by \nthe customs” but were instead “subject to [PVC] by the \nchambers.”    JA99  (emphasis  added);  JA428–29  (de-\nscribing the replacement of the 1997 “export licensing” \nregime with the PVC regime).   \n\nThe United States agreed.  In a 2009 WTO proceed-\ning related to raw materials, it relied on the Ministry’s \namicus brief in this case to argue that “China coordi-\nnates export prices for the products at issue through a \n‘system of self-discipline’ based on informal statements \nand oral agreements between traders and export reg-\nulators and where the [relevant chamber of commerce] \ndirects  commodity-specific  branches  or  coordination \n\n10 Amici Clarke and Howson, who claim no trade-law expertise \n(at 1–2), flatly ignore WTO’s summation in declaring it “inescap-\nable”  (at  17)  that  China  made  inconsistent  statements.    They \nseem not to have considered the possibility that their lay under-\nstanding of trade-law terminology is incorrect.",
        "31 \n\ngroups.”  JA676  (emphasis  added).11    The  WTO  ac-\ncepted that position, holding that “China requires ex-\nporting enterprises to export at set or coordinated ex-\nport  prices  or  otherwise  face  penalties.”    JA722.12  \nThus, the United States and the WTO both said what \nMOFCOM has maintained here: after 2002, China was \nstill  requiring  exporters  to  follow  a  price-setting  re-\ngime, albeit one that took a different form than before. \n\nThere is thus no inconsistency that could undermine \nthe Ministry’s position.  But the district court’s error \nwas more fundamental.  Even if China’s statement re-\ngarding  giving  up  “export  administration”  could  be \nread  as  connoting  an  abandonment  of  every  form  of \nprice or output control for Vitamin C, including indus-\ntrial self-discipline, that would at most establish that \nthe  reading  pressed  by  Petitioners  and  embraced  by \nthe  district  court  is  possible.    Petitioners  have  never \nidentified  any  evidence  that  anyone  contemporane-\nously  read  the  “export  administration”  statement  as \nthey do, and all evidence is that WTO participants did \nnot.  In such circumstances, a court should endeavor \nto reconcile the foreign sovereign’s statements, rather \n\n11 See  also  First  Written  Submission  of  the  United  States  of \nAmerica, China—Measures Related To The Exportation Of Vari-\nous Raw Materials, WT/DS394/DS395/DS398 ¶ 208 & nn.284–90 \n(June 1, 2010), https://goo.gl/95Qiwv (relying heavily on the Min-\nistry’s brief); Opening Oral Statement of Complainants, China—\nMeasures  Related  to  the  Exportation  of  Various  Raw  Materials, \nWT/DS394/DS395/DS398  ¶ 31  (Aug.  31,  2010),  https://goo.gl/ \nGqkcp6 (arguing that China maintained “a system that prevents \nexportation unless the seller meets or exceeds the minimum ex-\nport price”). \n\n12 This  holding  belies  the  notion  that  the  raw-materials  pro-\nceeding is distinguishable because it focused on whether conduct \nwas “attributable to,” rather than “required” by, China.  SG Br. \n31 n.7.",
        "32 \n\nthan jump to the conclusion that the supposed incon-\nsistency is a product of deceitful intent.    Only if such \nreconciliation is impossible should the court consider \ndeclining to defer.  That slow-to-anger approach is sup-\nported by the accuracy and comity considerations dis-\ncussed  above,  and  fully  addresses  the  Solicitor  Gen-\neral’s  (rather  alarmist)  concern  that  foreign  govern-\nments  will  lightly  swap  positions  and  demand  defer-\nence at each turn.  See McNab Opp. at 18–19.  Because \nthere was no inconsistency here—much less an irrec-\noncilable one—the Second Circuit properly deferred to \nthe Ministry’s reasonable interpretation of the regula-\ntions it created. \n\nB.  The Ministry’s Authority To Interpret Its \n\nOwn Rules Is Beyond Dispute. \n\nPetitioners assert for the first time in this Court that \nthe  Ministry  may  lack  authority  to  interpret  its  own \nrules and directives.  This untimely argument is frivo-\nlous.  \n\nThe regulations and requirements at issue indisput-\nably fall within the Ministry’s jurisdiction as “the high-\nest authority within the Chinese Government author-\nized to regulate foreign trade.”  Pet. App. 6a; Foreign \nTrade  Law,  art.  3  (promulgated  by  Standing  Comm. \nNat’l  People’s  Cong.,  May  12,  1994,  revised  Apr.  6, \n2004),  https://goo.gl/sHn37U  (“The  [Ministry]  is  in \ncharge of foreign trade throughout the country pursu-\nant  to  this  Law.”).    The  Ministry  “formulates  strate-\ngies, guidelines and policies concerning domestic and \nforeign trade and international economic cooperation, \ndrafts and enforces laws and regulations governing do-\nmestic and foreign trade, and regulates market opera-\ntion,” and until 2008 the Chamber operated “under the \nMinistry’s direct and active supervision” as part of “a \nregulatory  pricing  regime  mandated  by  the  govern-",
        "33 \n\nment of China.”  Pet. App. 190a–91a, 196a–97a.  Re-\nspondents’  expert  testified  below,  without  contradic-\ntion, that the Ministry’s “interpretation of its own reg-\nulations  and  policies  carries  decisive  weight  under \nChinese  law.”    JA142.    He  was  correct.    In  2001, \nChina’s State Council promulgated rulemaking proce-\ndures that empower the Ministry to make and inter-\npret its own regulations.  See Add. 24–25, Decree of the \nState  Council,  People’s  Republic  of  China  (No.  322), \nRegulations  on  Procedures  for  Formulation  of  Rules, \nart. 33 (effective Jan. 1, 2002) (“The power to interpret \nrules belongs to the formulating organs of rules.… In-\nterpretations of rules have the same force and effect as \nthe rules themselves.”).13 \n\nFurther,  the  Chinese  diplomatic  note  submitted  to \nthe Second Circuit, JA782–84, underscored the point: \nThe  Ministry’s  brief  stated  “the  official  views  of  the \nPeople’s Republic of China,” JA131.

The Min-\nistry  is  the  equivalent  of  a U.S.  cabinet-level  depart-\nment. Chinese law places the Ministry in charge of for-\neign trade throughout the country.  The Ministry ac-\ncordingly  formulates  strategies,  guidelines,  and  poli-\ncies concerning domestic and foreign trade and inter-\nnational cooperation.  It also drafts and enforces trade \nlaws  and  regulations,  and  regulates  markets.    And \ncontrary  to  Petitioners’  groundless  suggestion,  the \nMinistry’s authority to interpret the regulations at is-\nsue here was established below and is incontestable. \n\nThe Ministry has been actively involved in this liti-\ngation since 2005. It first presented the Chinese gov-\nernment’s authoritative interpretation of Chinese law \nin  2006,  when  it  filed  an  amicus  brief  in  the  district \ncourt. It reaffirmed its position in supplemental sub-\nmissions to the district court in 2008 and 2009, and in \nan amicus brief in the court of appeals in 2014. As both \ncourts  below  observed,  this  was  “historic.”  Pet.  App. \n6a. Never before had “any entity of the Chinese Gov-\nernment  …  appeared  amicus  curiae  before  any  U.S. \ncourt.” Id. at 6a n.5. \n\nThe  Ministry’s  submissions  explained  the  Chinese \ntrade regulations that, at relevant times (2002–2005), \nrequired the defendant companies to coordinate their \n\n1 No  counsel  for  any  party  authored  this  brief  in  whole  or  in \npart, and no other entity or person made any monetary contribu-\ntion  toward  the  preparation  and  submission  of  this  brief.    The \nparties have consenting to the filing of this brief.   \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f2 \n\nexport activities.  China further made clear, in a 2014 \ndiplomatic note to the State Department, that the Min-\nistry spoke for the Chinese Government in this litiga-\ntion. \n\nUnfortunately,  the  Ministry’s  efforts  to  assist  the \ndistrict court in understanding the meaning of its reg-\nulations,  including  by  explaining  the  economic,  cul-\ntural, linguistic, and legal context in which those reg-\nulations  were  created,  were  treated  with  open  suspi-\ncion  and  hostility.    The  district  court  even  asserted \nthat  the  Ministry’s  submissions  reflected  “a  post-hoc \nattempt  to  shield  defendants’  conduct  from  antitrust \nscrutiny.”    Pet.  App.  121a.    Petitioners  and  some  of \ntheir amici have continued that smear campaign here. \n\nThese accusations are profoundly disrespectful and \nwholly  unjustified.    As  the  Second  Circuit  explained, \nthe reasons the district court gave for disparaging the \nMinistry’s  submissions  were  ill-considered  and  at \npoints “nonsensical.”  Pet. App. 27a.  Consistent with \nits obligation to review de novo the district court’s for-\neign-law  determination,  the  Second  Circuit  re-exam-\nined  the  Ministry’s  interpretation,  found  it  “reasona-\nble,”  and  therefore  deferred  to  it.    Id.    The  Ministry \nrespectfully  submits  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  ap-\nproach and conclusions are correct.  A contrary result \nwould signal to private parties that they should follow \nPetitioners’  lead  and  disparage  the  competence  and \nmotives  of  foreign  sovereigns  who  appear  in  U.S. \ncourts.  It  would  likewise  signal  to  foreign  sovereigns \nthat their interpretations of their own laws will not be \nrespected here.  Those signals would seriously disserve \nthe  interests  of  accurate  adjudication  and  interna-\ntional  comity,  to  the  detriment  of  courts,  regulators, \nand regulated parties around the world. \n\n \n\f3 \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nI.  THE SECOND CIRCUIT CORRECTLY HELD \nTHAT A U.S. COURT IS BOUND TO DEFER \nTO  A  FOREIGN  SOVEREIGN’S  REASONA-\nBLE EXPLANATION OF ITS OWN LAW.   \n\nA.  United  States v.  Pink  held  that  a  foreign  sover-\neign’s official interpretation of its law, offered for use \nin U.S. litigation, is “conclusive.”  315 U.S. 203, 218–\n20 (1942).  Pink’s holding is not narrowly confined to \nits facts; instead, as the United States previously told \nthis Court, Pink established that “American courts are \nobligated to accept [a foreign sovereign’s legal] state-\nment at face value” unless it is facially ambiguous, in-\nconsistent, or incredible.  Br. of United States as Ami-\ncus Curiae at 23, Matsushita Elec. Indus. Co. v. Zenith \nRadio  Corp.,  475  U.S.  574  (1985)  (No.  83-2004) \n(Matsushita  U.S.  Br.).    In  Pink,  it  was  enough  that \nsome evidence supported the foreign sovereign’s inter-\npretation, even though the New York courts had held \nthat the voluminous record as a whole supported a dif-\nferent interpretation. \n\nThis Court’s other decisions have similarly relied on \nforeign  governments’  explanations  of  their  own  law, \nsubmitted (as here) through amicus briefs.  The courts \nof appeals, too, have consistently recognized that def-\nerence is warranted to a foreign government’s plausi-\nble interpretation of its own laws.  They have thus de-\nclined to defer where a foreign governmental body does \nnot appear before the court or its interpretive author-\nity is unclear, or where deferring to a changed inter-\npretation  on  appeal  would  disturb  the  finality  of  the \njudgment.    Nothing  of  the  kind  occurred  here.  The \nMinistry  presented  a  single,  unchanging  position \nthroughout this litigation.    \n\n \n\f4 \n\nB.  Deference enhances the accuracy of U.S. courts’ \nforeign-law determinations.  The tools, doctrines, and \nintuitions that serve American judges so well in inter-\npreting U.S. law are frequently unhelpful or even mis-\nleading when it comes to foreign law.  Plain-language \nanalysis  of  translated  materials  is  treacherous,  and \nmay  not  accord  with  foreign  interpretive  principles.  \nSecondary sources may not exist in English.  And ex-\npert testimony frequently comes with a partisan spin. \n\nAccordingly, it is only logical to regard a foreign sov-\nereign’s  official  and  reasonable  interpretation  of  its \nown  law as  “conclusive.”  The  district  court’s  analysis \nhere  vividly illustrates  the  dangers  of  a  contrary  ap-\nproach; the court attempted to decipher the “plain lan-\nguage” of translated regulations, overlooking that Chi-\nnese regulatory regimes rely heavily on other types of \nmaterial and use terms that might seem ambiguous or \neuphemistic  to  an  English-speaker  schooled  only  in \nAmerican law.  This misguided approach led the dis-\ntrict  court  to  accuse  the  Chinese  government  of  at-\ntempting  to  mislead  the  court,  understandably \nprompting a diplomatic protest. \n\nPetitioners  and  the  Solicitor  General  suggest  that \nforeign governments may mislead U.S. courts to pro-\ntect foreign interests, but they can identify no example \nof that happening in this Court or any other.  Notably, \nthe  Ministry  adhered  to  its  interpretation  here  even \nwhen the United States (among others) used the Min-\nistry’s  submissions  in  this  case  to  support  its  claims \nthat China’s trade practices violated WTO standards.  \nThat occurrence illustrates why foreign sovereigns are \nunlikely to espouse positions in U.S. courts they do not \nbelieve.  The positions they take here, in public filings, \nwill  have  consequences  in  domestic  settings  and \naround the world. \n\n \n\f5 \n\nDeference is also critical to international comity.  Re-\njecting a foreign sovereign’s explanation of its own law \ncan imply only two things: that a U.S. court knows a \ncountry’s laws better than its own government, or that \nthe foreign government is not being candid.  Both are \nprofoundly disrespectful.  The Court should not adopt \na rule that encourages litigants to accuse foreign gov-\nernments  of  incompetence  or  deceit,  and  encourages \ncourts  to  reject  foreign  sovereign’s  views  in  precisely \nthose cases that are important enough for them to par-\nticipate directly.   \n\nC.  Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 44.1 did not dis-\ncard the rule of deference to foreign sovereigns.  As the \nSolicitor  General  correctly  acknowledges,  there  is  no \nconflict  between  a  rule  of  deference  and  Rule  44.1’s \ntext.  Nor is there a conflict with Rule 44.1’s goals of \n(a)  making  foreign-law  determinations  questions  of \nlaw, not fact, and (b) removing limitations on the ma-\nterials  a  court  can  consider.    In  domestic  contexts, \ncourts  regularly  grant  deference  on  questions  of  law, \nand consider extrinsic materials in applying deference \ndoctrines.  So too here. \n\nAlthough the parties agree that domestic deference \ndoctrines  should  not  be  transplanted  wholesale  into \nthe  foreign-law  context,  analogies  may  be  illuminat-\ning. Like the Seventh Circuit, the Ministry believes it \nwould be inappropriate for courts to afford greater def-\nerence to executive-agency interpretations of domestic \nstatutes than to foreign government interpretations of \nforeign law. When U.S. courts decline to defer to a for-\neign sovereign’s interpretation of foreign law, they risk \napplying a rule that has never before existed and ap-\nplies to no one else, thereby imposing conflicting legal \nobligations on the parties before them.  And they risk \ninternational discord as a result. \n\n \n\f6 \n\nD.  The Solicitor General’s newly minted standard—\nin  which  any  number  of  “circumstances”  dictate  the \namount of deference due, if any—will not aid courts in \nresolving  difficult  issues  of  foreign  law,  and  will  not \nserve the interests of comity.  Indeed, although the So-\nlicitor General asserts that his approach will “ordinar-\nily”  afford  “substantial  weight”  to  a  foreign  govern-\nment’s interpretation, that assurance is impossible to \nsquare with his position that a court should resolve “a \ndisputed question of foreign law … in the same man-\nner  as  a  court  facing  any  other  unsettled  legal  ques-\ntion.”  The Court should not adopt that unprecedented \napproach. \n\nII.  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS  CORRECTLY \nDEFERRED TO THE MINISTRY’S REASON-\nABLE EXPLANATION OF CHINESE LAW. \n\nA.  The Second Circuit carefully examined the Min-\nistry’s submissions in context and in light of underly-\ning materials.  It also carefully explained the district \ncourt’s  key  analytical  errors—which  together  pro-\nduced a “nonsensical” reading of Chinese law.  Yet Pe-\ntitioners claim the Second Circuit blindly deferred to \nthe  Ministry  and  but  for  that  deference,  the  Second \nCircuit would have embraced the district court’s con-\nstruction.    That  is  a  strawman—the  Second  Circuit \nsaid nothing of the kind.   \n\nThe district court’s criticisms of the Ministry’s posi-\ntion were unfounded.  The Ministry provided a clear, \ndetailed, and cohesive interpretation of relevant Chi-\nnese  law.    The  district  court  appeared  troubled  that \naspects of the regulatory system were not fully spelled \nout in positive enactments, but that is typical of Chi-\nnese law.  Nor did the Ministry fail to distinguish be-\ntween the 1997 and 2002 regulatory regimes; rather, \nit carefully explained that the later regime rested on \n\n \n\f7 \n\nthe same basic concept as the earlier one, but was im-\nplemented differently. \n\nThe Ministry’s position here is also fully consistent \nwith  China’s  statements  to  the  WTO.    Those  state-\nments referred to the pre-2002 system of export quotas \nand licenses, but not to mechanisms such as the veri-\nfication-and-chop  system,  pursuant  to  which  (before \n2008) certain chambers of commerce were granted im-\nplementing authority to coordinate export prices, and \nthereby minimize export dumping issues that Chinese \nmanufacturers  might  encounter.    Indeed,  the  United \nStates later invoked the Ministry’s filings in this very \ncase to argue to the WTO that China controlled export \nprices  in  precisely  this  way,  including  during  the \n2002–2005 period, and the WTO agreed.  The district \ncourt simply misread China’s reference to “export ad-\nministration,”  giving  that  term  a  construction  never \nadopted by the trade specialists in the WTO proceed-\nings—an error Petitioners repeat here.  \n\nB.  There is no merit to the suggestion that the Min-\nistry lacks authority to interpret the regulatory mate-\nrials at issue.  In 2001, China’s State Council promul-\ngated rulemaking procedures that empower the Min-\nistry (and other Chinese agencies) to make and inter-\npret its own regulations.  The Ministry exercised that \nauthority  and,  moreover,  speaks  for  the  People’s  Re-\npublic of China here.  \n\n \n\f8 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  U.S. COURTS ARE BOUND TO DEFER TO A \nFOREIGN  SOVEREIGN’S  REASONABLE \nEXPLANATION OF ITS OWN LAW. \n\nA.  Pink  Held  That  A  Foreign  Sovereign’s \nExplanation  Of  Its  Own  Law  Is  Conclu-\nsive. \n\nThis Court has already held, on materially indistin-\nguishable facts, that a foreign government’s explana-\ntion of its own law, provided for use in U.S. litigation, \nis “conclusive.” Pink, 315 U.S. at 218–20.  That hold-\ning, which the Second Circuit followed below, is fully \nsupported  by  other  decisions  of  this  Court  and  the \ncourts of appeals, and should be sustained. \n\n1.  Pink  held  that  an  official  Soviet  declaration  ex-\nplaining the “intended effect of the Russian decree na-\ntionalizing  [Russian]  insurance  companies”  after  the \nRussian  Revolution  was  “conclusive”  of  the  decree’s \nmeaning under Russian law.  Id. at 218–20 (footnote \nomitted).  As the Solicitor General previously told this \nCourt, Pink establishes that “[o]nce a foreign govern-\nment  presents  a  statement  dealing  with  subjects \nwithin  its  area  of  sovereign  authority …  American \ncourts  are  obligated  to  accept  that  statement  at  face \nvalue;  the  [foreign]  government’s  assertions  concern-\ning the existence and meaning of its domestic law gen-\nerally should be deemed ‘conclusive.’” Matsushita U.S. \nBr.  at  23  (quoting  Pink,  315  U.S.  at  220).    Only \n“[p]lainly ambiguous,” “internally inconsistent,” or fa-\ncially “incredible” assertions do not warrant deference.  \nId. \n\nThe Solicitor General has now flipped positions and, \nlike Petitioners, argues that Pink turned on “unusual” \nand distinguishable facts.  SG Br. 27–29; Pet. Br. 39–\n41.  They argue that (i) “a wealth of record evidence … \n\n \n\f9 \n\nconfirmed” the Soviet interpretation; (ii) the interpre-\ntation came “in response to an explicit invitation from \nthe  U.S.  Executive  Branch”;  and  (iii)  this  Court  first \nfound “that the Commissariat had power to interpret \nRussian law.”  Pet. Br. 41.  These claims are unavail-\ning. \n\nFirst,  Petitioners  and  the  Solicitor  General  misun-\nderstand the facts of Pink.  The New York courts had \nheld—based  on  expert  testimony,  government  docu-\nments,  court  decisions,  and  academic  writings,  see \nMoscow  Fire  Ins.  Co.  v.  Bank  of  N.Y.  &  Tr.  Co.,  294 \nN.Y.S. 648, 683 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1937)—that the nation-\nalization  decrees  “were  not  intended  to  have  effect \nhere.” Moscow Fire Ins. Co. v. Bank of N.Y. & Tr. Co., \n20 N.E.2d 758, 767 (N.Y. 1939), aff’d by an equally di-\nvided court, 309 U.S. 624 (1940).  “Subsequently to the \nhearings in that case,” the United States obtained and \nsubmitted  the  official  Soviet  declaration.    Pink,  315 \nU.S. at 218.  When the issue arose again in Pink, on \nthe same record, id. at 216–17, this Court deemed the \ndeclaration “conclusive.”  It did so even though the dec-\nlaration  contradicted  the  New  York  courts’  holdings \nbased on “all the evidence in the voluminous record,” \nwhich this Court “d[id] not stop to review.”  Id. at 218. \n\nThus, Pink did not defer to the Soviet declaration be-\ncause it  was  supported  by  the  entire  record  (Pet. Br. \n41; SG Br. 10–11, 28–29); it deferred even though the \nlower courts thought the record, on balance, supported \nthe opposite conclusion. \n\nSecond,  although  U.S.  courts  previously  obtained \nforeign  legal  interpretations  “through  official  diplo-\nmatic channels” (SG Br. 28; Pet. Br. 41), that practice \nwas discontinued 40 years ago at this Court’s sugges-\ntion,  with  the  State  Department’s  concurrence.    See \nKristen E. Eichensehr, Foreign Sovereigns As Friends \n\n \n\f10 \n\nof the Court, 102 Va. L. Rev. 289, 299 (2016).  “[F]or-\neign  governments [now]  communicate  their  views  to \nthe  judicial  branch  through …  the  filing  of  formal \nbriefs,” id., as the Ministry did here.2  \n\n Moreover,  China  did  act  through  diplomatic  chan-\nnels.  After the district court ruled, the Chinese Em-\nbassy sent a diplomatic note to the State Department \nhighlighting  that  “China  has  attached  great  im-\nportance to this case” and reiterating that the Minis-\ntry’s  submissions  had  correctly  “described  China’s \ncompulsory  requirements  concerning  vitamin  C  ex-\nports.”    JA782–84.  That  note  was  before  the  Second \nCircuit, just as the Soviet declaration was before the \nNew York courts in Pink.  315 U.S. at 220. \n\nThird, Petitioners now contend (at 42–43) that Pink \nturned on a “threshold” finding that the Soviet decla-\nration  was  issued  pursuant  to  the  Commissariat’s \npower to interpret law, and that the Ministry has not \nshown equivalent authority here.  But insofar as the \nlower courts made no such formal finding, that is be-\ncause  Petitioners  never  raised  this  point  below.    See \nOBB Personenverkehr AG v. Sachs, 136 S. Ct. 390, 398 \n(2015) (“Absent unusual circumstances … we will not \nentertain  arguments  not  made  below.”).    Regardless, \nMOFCOM’s power to authoritatively interpret the reg-\nulatory materials at issue here is confirmed by the rec-\nord, by the diplomatic note, and by Chinese statutory \nlaw.  See infra p. 32.   \n\nThis case is on all fours with Pink. In both cases, a \nforeign governmental department issued a statement \nfor  use  in  U.S.  litigation  regarding  the  specific  issue \n\n2 Nor was the Soviet interpretation “akin to” a certified ques-\ntion to a state high court because it was obtained diplomatically.  \nSG Br. 28.  Certified questions are issued by courts; the Pink dec-\nlaration was obtained by the United States, a litigant. \n\n \n                                            \n\f11 \n\nbeing litigated; its authority to speak on behalf of the \nforeign  nation  was  beyond  dispute;  and  there  was \nother  evidence  of  foreign  law  whose  import  was  dis-\nputed.  The Second Circuit correctly followed Pink by \ndeferring to the Ministry’s reasonable interpretation of \nthe rules that the Ministry and the relevant chamber \nof  commerce  (acting  under  the  Ministry’s  direction) \nmade, implemented, and enforced.   \n\n2.  Contrary to Petitioners’ (at 29) and the Solicitor \nGeneral’s (at 20–21) claims, Fremont v. United States \nfurther supports deference here.  58 U.S. (17 How.) 542 \n(1854).  Fremont concerned the validity of a claimant’s \ntitle to California land, arising from a pre-annexation \ngrant  by  the  Mexican  government.    The  court  noted \nthat  in  similar  cases  it  had  considered  a  variety  of \nsources  to  determine  foreign  law.    Id.  at  557.    There \nwas no question of deference because no official foreign \ninterpretation was proffered.  The Court emphasized, \nhowever, that it “could not, without doing injustice to \nindividuals,  give  to  the  Mexican laws a  more  narrow \nand  strict  construction  than  they  received  from  the \nMexican authorities who were intrusted with their exe-\ncution.”  Id. at 561 (emphasis added).  The Court thus \ndeclined to impose preconditions to the vesting of title \nthat Mexican “regulations for granting lands” seemed \nto require, because title “would have been regarded as \nvested and valid by the Mexican authorities” regard-\nless.  Id. at 561–62.  Fremont thus demonstrates this \nCourt’s  practice  of  accepting  a  foreign  government’s \nunderstanding of foreign law even where a U.S. court \nwriting on a blank slate might reach a different con-\nclusion. \n\n3.  This Court’s more recent decisions have similarly \nrelied  on  foreign  governments’  explanations  of  their \nown law.  In Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California, \n\n \n\f12 \n\nthis  Court  (while  disagreeing  with  the  United  King-\ndom’s  ultimate  policy  recommendation)  accepted  at \nface value the United Kingdom’s explanation of what \nBritish antitrust law did and did not require.  509 U.S. \n764, 798–99 (1993).  Similarly, JPMorgan Chase Bank \nv.  Traffic  Stream  (BVI)  Infrastructure  Ltd.  relied  on \n“the  United  Kingdom’s  own  filings”  and  diplomatic \nnotes to establish the “United Kingdom[’s] … author-\nity over the BVI’s statutory law,” and thus the citizen-\nship of BVI corporations.  536 U.S. 88, 96–97 (2002).  \nAnd Abbott v. Abbott relied on “a Chilean agency[’s]” \nexplanation to hold that Chilean law created a “joint” \nor  “shared”  right  to  determine  a  child’s  place  of  resi-\ndence.  560 U.S. 1, 10 (2010).   \n\nEven now, this Court has amicus briefs before it in \nUnited States v. Microsoft from several foreign author-\nities,  making  arguments  based  on  foreign  law.    E.g., \nEuropean  Commission  Br.  at  8–16,  United  States  v. \nMicrosoft, No. 17-2 (Dec. 13, 2017); U.K. Gov’t Br. at \n5–6, id.  These authorities are surely interested in the \ncase’s outcome and effects on their citizens.  But no one \nwould think these submissions should be disregarded \nbecause of those interests, or on the theory that U.S. \ncourts  better  understand  European  privacy  law  or \nBritish surveillance powers. \n\n4.  Though they have used varying formulations, the \ncourts  of  appeals  have  consistently  concluded  that \nstrong deference to appearing foreign sovereigns’ offi-\ncial interpretations of foreign law is warranted. \n\nIn In re Oil Spill by the Amoco Cadiz, France was a \nplaintiff seeking recovery from Amoco for a massive oil \nspill;  a  key  issue  was  whether  a  French  statute  im-\nposed liability for the clean-up costs at issue.  954 F.2d \n1279,  1289,  1311  (7th  Cir.  1992)  (per  curiam).    The \nstatute  was  not  clear,  and  “[e]ach  side  presented  an \nexpert of the highest skill and repute.”  Id. at 1312.  It \n\n \n\f13 \n\nwas  enough,  however,  that  France’s  interpretation \nwas  “plausible”:  “A  court  of  the  United  States  owes \nsubstantial  deference  to  the  construction  France \nplaces on its domestic law.”  Id.  The Seventh Circuit \nthus  declined  to  “decide  whether  [France’s]  under-\nstanding of the law is correct,” and deferred to it.  Id. \n\nIn Access Telecom, Inc. v. MCI Telecommunications \nCorp., the Fifth Circuit generally embraced Amoco Ca-\ndiz’s approach.  197 F.3d 694, 714 (5th Cir. 1999).  It \nnonetheless declined to follow the guidance stated in a \nMexican  government  circular  because  the  Mexican \nagency was “not before the court”; its interpretive au-\nthority was unclear; and “[m]ore importantly” the cir-\ncular pre-dated a significant change in law.  Id.   \n\nIn  Richmark  Corp.  v.  Timber  Falling  Consultants, \nthe defendant, a company incorporated in China and \n“an  arm  of  the  PRC  government,”  resisted  discovery \nbecause  its  financial  information  “was  classified  a \nstate secret.”  959 F.2d 1468, 1471–72 (9th Cir. 1992).  \nThe  company  produced  a  letter  from  the  “arm  of  the \nState  Council …  in  charge  of  overseeing  [its]  opera-\ntions” confirming this interpretation.  Id. at 1472.  The \nNinth Circuit “accept[ed] as valid the [Chinese] letter \ninterpreting the State Secrets Act,” explaining that a \nU.S. court has “neither the power nor the expertise to \ndetermine for ourselves what PRC law is.”  Id. at 1474 \n& n.7.  The court then balanced China’s “admitted in-\nterest  in  secrecy”  against  the  plaintiffs’  interests  in \ndisclosure to determine whether discovery was appro-\npriate under U.S. law.  Id. at 1474. \n\nUnited States v. McNab, which Petitioners and the \nSolicitor  General  invoke,  is  more  about  finality  than \ndeference.    331  F.3d  1228  (11th  Cir.  2003).    The  de-\nfendants were prosecuted under the Lacey Act for im-\nporting  lobsters  taken  in  violation  of  Honduran  law.  \nId. at 1232.  “Throughout the investigation and trial … \n\n \n\f14 \n\ninterpretation:   \n\ninitial \n\nboth the government and the district court relied upon \nthe  Honduran  officials’  verification  of  the  Honduran \nlaws.”  Id.  The Eleventh Circuit said the district court \ncorrectly  deferred  to  that \n“Among the most logical sources for the court to look \nto  in  its  determination  of  foreign  law  are  the  foreign \nofficials charged with enforcing the laws of their coun-\ntry.…  The  court  reasonably  may  assume  that  state-\nments from foreign officials are a reliable and accurate \nsource ….”  Id. at 1241.  On appeal, however, Hondu-\nras  filed  a  brief that  the  panel  majority  described  as \nasserting for the first time that the Honduran regula-\ntions were invalid or had been retroactively repealed.  \nId. at 1240 & n.23.3  The court declined to upset the \nconvictions on this basis, ruling that it would not sub-\nstitute  deference  for  the  first  opinion  with  deference \nfor  the  second  because  there  “must  be  some  finality \nwith  representations  of  foreign  law.”    Id.  at  1241  & \nn.25.  Here, the Ministry’s position has never varied. \n\nIn McKesson HBOC, Inc. v. Islamic Republic of Iran \n(Pet. Br. 32; SG Br. 19), no instrumentality of the Ira-\nnian  government  offered  an  official  interpretation  of \nIranian  law,  and  deference  was  never  invoked.    271 \nF.3d  1101  (D.C.  Cir.  2001).    Rather,  the  meaning  of \nIranian  law  was  litigated  through  expert  testimony.  \nId. at 1108–09.  Thus, when the D.C. Circuit concluded \nthat  Iran’s  evidence  did  not  establish  the  categorical \nlegal rule Iran’s U.S. counsel asserted, it was not re-\nfusing to defer to an  official interpretation; it merely \nrefused to credit a party’s experts.  Id. at 1109; see Pet. \nfor  Certiorari  at  24–25,  Islamic  Republic  of  Iran  v. \nMcKesson  HBOC,  Inc.,  537  U.S.  941  (2002)  (No.  01-\n\n3 A dissent contended that the appellate amicus brief was the \nonly  official  governmental  statement  presented.    331  F.3d  at \n1247. \n\n \n                                            \n\f15 \n\n1521)  (arguing  Iran  was  entitled  to  summary  judg-\nment  because  its  experts’  “affidavits  and  legal  opin-\nions” were “unrebutted”). \n\nB.  Deference  Serves  The  Interests  of  Accu-\n\nracy and International Comity. \n\nDeference serves two crucial values:  (1) it enhances \nthe accuracy of the resulting legal determination, and \n(2)  it  furthers  international  comity.    And  deference \ndoes  not  surrender  U.S.  prerogatives  to  foreign  na-\ntions.    As  Pink  emphasized,  whether  foreign  law \nshould supply all or part of the rule of decision is a do-\nmestic-law  matter.    315  U.S.  at  221.    The  United \nStates  is  free,  for  example,  to  establish  endangered-\nspecies protections that do not incorporate foreign law. \nCf. McNab, 331 F.3d at 1236.  But where the laws of \nthe  United  States  do  incorporate  foreign-law  stand-\nards,  its  courts  should  defer,  in  all  but  the  most  ex-\ntraordinary  cases,  to  a  foreign  sovereign’s  official  in-\nterpretation of those standards.     \n\n1.  Deference  enhances  accuracy.    U.S.  judges  are \n“likely to miss nuances in the foreign law, to fail to ap-\npreciate  the  way  in  which  one  branch  of  the  other \ncountry’s law interacts with another, or to assume er-\nroneously that the foreign law mirrors U.S. law when \nit does not.” Bodum USA, Inc. v. La Cafetiere, Inc., 621 \nF.3d  624,  638–39  (7th  Cir.  2010)  (Wood,  J.,  concur-\nring).  Some foreign laws will be the subject of analysis \nand  explanation  in  English-language  materials,  but \nmany  others  will  not.    Parties  can  offer  expert  testi-\nmony, but that is expensive and often “adds an adver-\nsary’s spin.”  Id. at 629 (majority op.).  It is thus “logi-\ncal” to defer to a foreign sovereign’s statements, which \na “court reasonably may assume … are a reliable and \naccurate source.” McNab, 331 F.3d at 1241. And defer-\nence is “particularly important” where there are “stark \n\n \n\f16 \n\ndifferences”  between  the  foreign  and  U.S.  legal  sys-\ntems.  Pet. App. 29a. \n\nPetitioners repeatedly invoke the need for accuracy \n(at 27–33), but ignore the risk that a weak or indeter-\nminate deference rule will leave U.S. judges prone to \nfall back on familiar American legal doctrines or intu-\nitions  that  may  be  an  unreliable  compass  in  foreign \nwaters.  See Bader v. Kramer, 484 F.3d 666, 670 (4th \nCir. 2007) (reliance on the “plain and ordinary mean-\ning” of foreign law is “problematic” because it can pro-\nduce a conclusion “divorced from that term’s meaning \nin the law of the [foreign] country”); Whallon v. Lynn, \n230 F.3d 450, 456 (1st Cir. 2000) (“Care must be taken \nto  avoid  imposing  American  legal  concepts  onto  an-\nother legal culture.”).   \n\nThe  district  court’s  analysis  here  illustrates  these \nperils.    The  “Chinese  legal-  and  economic-regulatory \nsystem” is “unique and complex”:  “[T]he Chinese gov-\nernment [] frequently governs by regulations promul-\ngated by various ministries”; “private citizens or com-\npanies may be authorized under  Chinese regulations \nto act in certain circumstances as government agents”; \nand  “an  interpretation  suggested  by  the  plain  lan-\nguage of a governmental directive may not accurately \nreflect Chinese law.”  Pet. App. 29a (omission in origi-\nnal).  And Petitioners offered no expert evidence sup-\nporting their interpretation.  Id. at 59a n.5.  \n\nThe district court thus embarked on a solo mission \nto interpret the Chinese regulatory regime.  It rejected \nthe expert testimony offered by Respondents, and de-\nclined to hear argument from any party at summary \njudgment.  It then pursued a “plain language” review \nof Chinese law, Pet. App. 97a, without asking whether \na  Chinese  lawyer  would  do  the  same.    It  relied  on  a \nseries of unsupported assumptions about whether and \n\n \n\f17 \n\nhow Chinese law could “compel[]” anticompetitive con-\nduct, which the court of appeals correctly rejected as \nillogical.  Id. at 30a–32a.  This analysis led the court \nto  accuse  the  Chinese  government  of  intentional  de-\nception.  Id. at 120–21a (“The 2009 Statement does not \nread  like  a  frank  and  straightforward  explanation  of \nChinese  law.…  [T]he  Ministry’s  assertion  of  compul-\nsion is a post-hoc attempt to shield defendants’ conduct \nfrom antitrust scrutiny”). There was nothing “respect-\nful” (Pet. Br. 4) about this approach, and nothing reli-\nable about it either. \n\nPetitioners say (at 34–35) it is “incoherent” to afford \ngreater  deference  when  a  foreign  sovereign  actually \nappears before a U.S. court.  The courts of appeals dis-\nagree. Compare Amoco Cadiz, 954 F.2d at 1312 (defer-\nence is owed even if “the interpretation may occur in \n(or in anticipation of) litigation”), with Access Telecom, \n197 F.3d at 714 (no deference where, inter alia, Mexi-\ncan  agency  was  “not  before  the  court”).    So  does  the \nSolicitor  General,  who  acknowledges  that  a  foreign \ngovernment’s  direct  participation  ensures  that  the \ncourt receives an interpretation grounded in the spe-\ncific context of the dispute.  SG Br. 25.  And participa-\ntion permits the court to engage directly with counsel \nfor  the  foreign  sovereign,  including  by  posing  ques-\ntions at oral argument.4   \n\nPetitioners and their amici raise the specter of a for-\neign sovereign misleading a U.S. court to protect for-\neign interests (Pet. Br. 36; SG Br. 25), but they cannot \n\n4 The  Solicitor  General  says  (at  24)  the  Second  Circuit’s  de-\nscription  of  the  Ministry’s  submission  as  “a  sworn  evidentiary \nproffer” was “inapt,” but the Ministry submitted a sworn declara-\ntion  authenticating  the  underlying  materials.    Regardless, \nwhether  a  foreign  submission  is  “sworn”  is  not  decisive;  what \nmatters is whether it presents an official, authoritative interpre-\ntation. \n\n \n                                            \n\f18 \n\nidentify  any  instance  of  this  happening  even  though \ndecisions  like  Pink  and  Amoco  Cadiz  have  long  been \non the books.  Little wonder. Foreign governments are \nnot  frequently  parties  in  U.S.  courts,  and  when  they \nare, U.S. law usually predominates, cf. RJR Nabisco v. \nEuropean Cmty., 136 S. Ct. 2090 (2016), even if foreign \nlaw  plays  some  role,  e.g.,  Amoco  Cadiz,  954  F.2d  at \n1289.   \n\nMoreover,  foreign  governments  have  strong  incen-\ntives  to  accurately  explain  their  laws  to  U.S.  courts.  \nBecause U.S. court filings are public, foreign govern-\nments know their statements will endure beyond the \ncase  at  hand,  and  may  have  ramifications  in  their \nhome courts or international tribunals.  This very case \nprovides an exemplar:  The United States (along with \nthe European Union and Mexico) cited the Ministry’s \nfilings as supporting a WTO complaint against China.  \nInfra p. 30.  And if a foreign government were ever to \noffer  a  facially  incredible, inconsistent,  or wholly  un-\nsupported  interpretation,  neither  Pink  nor  the  deci-\nsion below would require deference.  Pet. App. 25a & \nn.8; supra p. 8. \n\n2.  Deference  also  serves  important  international \ncomity  principles.    As  just  explained,  deference  rests \non the premise that foreign sovereigns will accurately \ndescribe their law to U.S. courts.  The Court should not \nadopt  a  rule  that  encourages  lower  courts  to  decide \n“whether the representation of consuls, ambassadors, \nand other representatives of foreign nations is credible \nor made in good faith.”  Zschernig v. Miller, 389 U.S. \n429,  434  (1968)  (cautioning  against  such  inquiries). \nForeign sovereigns will have little interest in partici-\npating in U.S. litigation if their motives inevitably will \nbe  demeaned.  The  result  of  adopting  Petitioners’ \nstandard  would  be  to  deprive  the  courts  of  valuable \n\n \n\f19 \n\nguidance in many cases, and to create needless inter-\nnational friction in others. \n\nThe  Solicitor  General  disputes  that  these  conse-\nquences will follow, since “reject[ing] a foreign govern-\nment’s characterization of its laws does not thereby ac-\ncuse  the  foreign  government  of  misrepresenting  the \npertinent  facts.”    SG  Br.  24  (emphasis  added).    But \nsuch  a  rejection  necessarily  implies  that  the  foreign \ngovernment  is  either  misrepresenting  the  pertinent \nlaw or is so ignorant of its law that an American judge \nknows better. Neither suggestion promotes comity.  Cf. \nBr.  for  Australia,  Canada,  and  United  Kingdom  as \nAmicus Curiae at 9–10, Matsushita, 475 U.S. 574 (urg-\ning that ignoring Pink and allowing a U.S. court to ad-\njudicate  the  veracity  of  a  foreign  sovereign’s  legal \nstatement  “would  be  an  unacceptable  intrusion  into \n[its] sovereignty”). \n\n3.  Some amici contend that strong deference would \n“distort” the “holistic balancing” test this Court has ap-\nplied to determine the effect of foreign law in a variety \nof contexts.  E.g., U.S. Chamber of Commerce Br. 3, 11; \nsee also Am. Antitrust Inst. Br. 4.  These arguments \nconfuse two separate issues: (a) how to determine the \ncontent of foreign law; and (b) once that content is de-\ntermined, what effect foreign law should have in U.S. \ncourts.  See Pink, 315 U.S. at 220–21 (explaining that \nthese  are  “distinct  matter[s]”).    The  latter  question, \nemphasized by these amici, is beyond the scope of the \nquestion  presented.    Likewise,  the  “weighty  separa-\ntion-of-powers  concerns”  in  Pink  (Pet.  Br.  41)  influ-\nenced the analysis of whether U.S. courts should give \n\n \n\f20 \n\neffect to the Russian decree, not the antecedent deter-\nmination of its Russian-law meaning.  315 U.S. at 221–\n34.5 \n\nHere, after properly deferring to the Ministry’s sub-\nmissions,  the  Second  Circuit  turned  to  Sherman  Act \nprecedents to  decide  whether dismissal was required \nas  a  matter  of  comity.    Pet.  App.  12a–18a,  33a–38a. \nThe court’s answer was yes, and this Court declined to \nreview whether comity is an appropriate basis to dis-\nmiss a Sherman Act claim.  Pet. i.  Thus, U.S. law ul-\ntimately controlled this case by determining the effect \nof Chinese law on the outcome. \n\nC.  Neither  Rule  44.1  Nor  Domestic  Defer-\n\nence Doctrines Are Relevant Here. \n\n1.  Petitioners and  the  Solicitor  General  spill  much \nink  arguing  that  the  decision  below—and  Pink,  for \nthat matter—is inconsistent with Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 44.1.  Not so.  Rule 44.1 provides that “[i]n \ndetermining  foreign  law,  the  court  may  consider  any \nrelevant  material  or  source,”  and  the  resulting  deci-\nsion is “a ruling on a question of law.”  Fed. R. Civ. P. \n44.1.    As  the  Solicitor  General  concedes  (at  17),  the \nRule  says  nothing  about  deference  to  foreign  sover-\neigns or the scope of a court’s discretion in reaching a \nsubstantive determination of foreign law.  Contra Pet. \nBr. 31, 33.  And there is no suggestion that the Rules \n\n5 Thus, First National City Bank v. Banco Para el Comercio Ex-\nterior de Cuba, 462 U.S. 611 (1983), does not counsel against def-\nerence.    Contra  U.S.  Chamber  Br.  12–13.    There,  the  Court  ac-\ncepted that a Cuban bank was “a separate and distinct juridical \nentity” from the Cuban government under Cuban law, but applied \ninternational and U.S. law to determine “the effect to be given to \nBancec’s separate juridical status” for FSIA purposes.  462 U.S. \nat 616 n.3, 619, 621.  As in Pink, the Court accepted that Cuban \nlaw had the meaning asserted by Cuban officials, and looked to \nU.S. law to determine the effect of that foreign-law conclusion. \n\n \n                                            \n\f21 \n\nCommittee intended to alter or abrogate Pink in any \nway.  The Second Circuit rightly found no conflict be-\ntween Rule 44.1’s procedures for determining foreign \nlaw  and  Pink’s  rule  of  deference.    Pet.  App.  22a;  cf. \nPink,  315  U.S.  at  220–21  &  nn.4–5  (applying  New \nYork’s procedural rules on how a court may receive ev-\nidence of foreign law). \n\nNor  is  there  any  conflict  between  Pink’s  deference \nrule  and  Rule  44.1’s  purposes  of  (i)  establishing  that \nforeign law’s meaning is a question of law, not fact, and \n(ii) removing limitations on the materials a court may \nconsider.  See Pet. Br. 28, 30–31; SG Br. 14–16.  The \n“interpretation” of a federal statute is equally “a ques-\ntion of law,”  McDermott  Int’l,  Inc.  v.  Wilander,  498 \nU.S. 337, 356 (1991), and yet courts routinely defer to \nagency  interpretations  of  those  statutes,  Encino  Mo-\ntorcars,  LLC  v.  Navarro,  136  S. Ct.  2117,  2124–25 \n(2016).  And the Second Circuit made clear that Pink’s \ndeference rule does not prevent a court from consider-\ning “any relevant material or source.”  Pet. App. 12a, \n22a (emphasis added); see Pink, 315 U.S. at 221 & n.5.   \n\n2.  The parties generally agree that domestic defer-\nence doctrines do not govern here.6  SG Br. 19–20; Pet. \nBr. 47–55; Resp. Br. 31–32.  But Petitioners draw the \nwrong lesson from that fact, arguing there is no basis \nto  “privileg[e]  the  representations  of  foreign  govern-\nments” over those of domestic government bodies.  Pet. \nBr.  47–48.    That  overlooks  critical  differences.    U.S. \ncourts lack the expertise to decipher foreign law, and \nthus risk reaching an erroneous interpretation that—\nbecause it does not actually alter foreign law in non-\nU.S.  applications—imposes  inconsistent  legal  obliga-\ntions on regulated parties.  See Richmark, 959 F.2d at \n\n6 Petitioners’  lengthy  argument  (at  48–55)  that  “the  Chevron \ndoctrine cannot be sensibly applied” here is thus beside the point. \n\n \n                                            \n\f22 \n\n1474 n.7 (court has no “power [ ]or … expertise to de-\ntermine for ourselves what PRC law is”).  Nor can such \nan  error  be  rectified  through  remand  to  a  domestic \nagency or congressional intervention.   \n\nAnother telling difference is that a court’s refusal to \ndefer to a federal or state agency will not cause an in-\nternational  incident.    Rejecting  a  foreign  sovereign’s \ninterpretation of foreign law can have just that result.  \nThe  Chinese  Government  has  already  protested  the \ndistrict court’s disrespectful treatment of the Ministry \nin this case.  JA782–84.  Deference here is thus sup-\nported by comity concerns that simply do not exist in \nthe  domestic  arena.    See  Amoco  Cadiz,  954  F.2d  at \n1312  (“Giving  the  conclusions  of  a  sovereign  nation \nless respect than those of an administrative agency is \nunacceptable.”). \n\nD.  The Solicitor General’s Position Is Hope-\n\nlessly Indeterminate. \n\nSince abandoning its recognition that Pink provides \nthe standard of deference here, supra p. 8, the United \nStates has searched in vain for a clear and consistent \nposition.  Although the Solicitor General now says (at \n19)  that  domestic-deference  “analogies  are  generally \nunhelpful,”  the  Government  argued  in  McNab  that \nSkidmore deference was the proper “analog[ue].”  Brief \nin  Opposition  at  17–18,  McNab  v.  United States, No. \n03-622 (Dec. 29, 2003) (McNab Opp.); but see SG Br. \n21 n.3.  At the certiorari stage in this case, the Govern-\nment  accepted  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  formulation \nwas  “not  necessarily …  problematic.”    Br.  for  United \nStates as Amicus Curiae at 9.  Now the Solicitor Gen-\neral  attacks  the  Second  Circuit’s  “rigid”  standard  (at \n22), but declines to offer any “formula or rule” for def-\nerence.  He instead posits numerous (non-exhaustive) \n“circumstances” that are “relevant,” suggests “the ap-\n\n \n\f23 \n\npropriate weight in each case will depend on the cir-\ncumstances,” and opines that a court should resolve “a \ndisputed question of foreign law … in the same man-\nner  as  a  court  facing  any  other  unsettled  legal  ques-\ntion.” SG Br. 9, 16, 19–20, 21; see also Pet. Br. 54–55.   \n\nThe  Court  should  reject  this  invitation  to  overturn \nevery extant standard and leave the lower courts with \nnone. “[O]pen-ended balancing tests[ ] can yield unpre-\ndictable and at times arbitrary results,” Lexmark Int’l, \nInc.  v.  Static  Control  Components,  Inc.,  134  S. Ct. \n1377, 1392 (2014), and that caution is clearly apt here.  \nNever before have U.S. courts reviewed de novo a for-\neign sovereign’s interpretation of its own laws.  Never \nbefore has that been thought desirable. That standard \nwould not mirror past practice, and it would not mirror \ninternational practice, under which, for example, “any \n[WTO] Member can reasonably expect that considera-\nble deference be given to its views on the meaning of \nits own law.”7  And it is a recipe for chaos and unfair \nsurprise—one-off judicial decisions that do not reflect \nthe  actual  law  of  any  foreign  jurisdiction,  impose  in-\nconsistent  legal  obligations  on  private  parties,  and \ngive rise to unwarranted diplomatic friction.  \n\nThere  is  no  need  for  such  experimentation.    Pink \nheld long ago that a foreign sovereign’s reasonable ex-\nplanation  of  its  own  law  is  conclusive  of  the  foreign-\nlaw  question.    That  rule  is  workable,  supported  by \nstrong  policy  considerations,  consistent  with  long-\n\n7 Panel Report, United States – Sections 301-310 of the Trade \nAct  of  1974,  WTO  Doc.  WT/DS152/R  ¶ 7.19  (adopted  Jan.  27, \n2000),  https://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/dispu_e/wtds152r. \npdf.  The United States  advocates this  “considerable deference” \nstandard in its own WTO submissions.  E.g., Second Written Sub-\nmission of the United States, United States – Section 129(c)(1) of \nthe  Uruguay  Round  Agreements  Act,  WT/DS221,  at  3  (Mar.  8, \n2002), https://goo.gl/bnBYdN. \n\n \n                                            \n\f24 \n\nstanding  practice,  and  unaffected  by  Rule  44.1.    The \nSecond Circuit’s holding was correct. \n\nII.  THE  COURT  OF  APPEALS  CORRECTLY \nDEFERRED TO THE MINISTRY’S REASON-\nABLE  INTERPRETATION  OF  CHINESE \nLAW. \n\nA.  The Second Circuit Properly Determined \nThat The Ministry’s Explanation Of Chi-\nnese Law Was Reasonable. \n\n1.  Petitioners paint the Second Circuit’s standard as \nrequiring  blind  deference  to  foreign  sovereign  inter-\npretations in all cases and without regard to other ev-\nidence.  Pet. Br. 22–23, 26; see SG Br. 22.  Not so.  The \nSecond Circuit recognized that it could “consider any \nrelevant material or source, including the legal author-\nities supplied by the parties on appeal.” Pet. App. 12a.  \nEven after receiving a foreign sovereign’s submission, \na court “must still evaluate the relevant source mate-\nrial  within  the  context  of  each  case.”    Id.  at  23a.    If \n“there is no documentary evidence or reference of law \nproffered  to  support  a  foreign  sovereign’s  interpreta-\ntion of its own laws, deference may be inappropriate.”  \nId. at 25a n.8; see SG Br. 22 n.4.  At bottom, deference \nis proper only if the foreign sovereign’s explanation is \n“reasonable under the circumstances.”  Pet. App. 25a.  \nThat is a sound and fair restatement of Pink’s holding. \n\n2.  In  applying  this  standard,  the  Second  Circuit \npaid “careful attention” to the Chinese regulations at \nissue and the facts surrounding their application.  Pet. \nApp.  27a–33a.    In  particular,  it  observed  that,  “[t]he \n2002 Notice, inter alia, demonstrates that  from 2002 \nto 2005 … Chinese law required Defendants to partic-\nipate  in  the  PVC  regime  in  order  to  export  vitamin \nC.   This  regulatory  regime  allowed  vitamin  C  manu-\n\n \n\f25 \n\nfacturers the export only of vitamin C subject to con-\ntracts  that  complied  with  the  ‘industry-wide  negoti-\nated’ price.”  Id. at 27a.  The court said that, by itself, \nthe term “industry-wide negotiated” might be ambigu-\nous, but pointed out that it would be “nonsensical” to \nrequire regulated parties to comply with such a “mini-\nmum  price  point  if  there  were  no  directive  to  agree \nupon such a price”; the court thus found reasonable the \nMinistry’s explanation that “members of the regulated \nindustry were required to negotiate and agree upon a \nprice.”  Id. at 27a–28a.   \n\nThe court similarly observed that “on their face the \nterms ‘industry self-discipline,’ ‘coordination,’ and ‘vol-\nuntary restraint’” could imply a lack of compulsion, but \naccepted  as  reasonable  the  statement  that  setting \nprices was mandatory, in light of the underlying mate-\nrials and the Ministry’s explanation of the trade regu-\nlations it had adopted.  See Pet. App. 28a (Second Cir-\ncuit stating that “these are terms of art within Chinese \nlaw connoting the government’s expectation that pri-\nvate actors actively self-regulate to achieve the govern-\nment’s  policy  goals”);  JA138,  248–49.    It  was  in  this \ncontext that the Second Circuit said a “court [must] not \nembark on a challenge to a foreign government’s offi-\ncial  representation  to  the  court  regarding  its  laws  or \nregulations, even if that representation is inconsistent \nwith  how  those  laws  might  be  interpreted  under  the \nprinciples of our legal system.”  Pet. App. 26a (empha-\nsis  added);  SG  Br.  22  (omitting  the  italicized  lan-\nguage); Pet. Br. 50 (same).  The point was not that a \ncourt must close its eyes to extrinsic materials; it was \nthat a U.S. court must remain keenly aware of its own \nlimitations as a foreign-law interpreter. \n\nThe Second Circuit then highlighted three key errors \ncommitted  by  the  district  court.  “First,  [the  district \n\n \n\f26 \n\ncourt]  determined  that  whether  Chinese  law  com-\npelled Defendants’ anticompetitive conduct depended \nin part on whether Defendants petitioned the Chinese \nGovernment  to  approve  and  sanction  such  conduct.”  \nPet.  App.  30a. This  was  error  because  the reason  for \nthe  Chinese  legal  requirements  is  both  irrelevant  to \ntheir  existence  and  cannot  be  questioned  under  the \nact-of-state doctrine.  Id. at 31a.  “Second, it relied on \nevidence  that  China’s  price-fixing  laws  were  not  en-\nforced  to  conclude  that  China’s  price  fixing  laws  did \nnot exist.”  Id. at 30a.  This too was error, because it \n“confuses  the  question  of  what  Chinese  law  required \nwith  whether  the  vitamin  C  regulations  were  en-\nforced.”  Id. at 32a.8  “And third, it determined that if \nChinese law did not compel the exact anticompetitive \nconduct  alleged  in  the  complaint,  then  there  was  no \ntrue conflict.”  Id. at 30a.  In fact, a true conflict exists \nwhenever it is impossible to comply with both nations’ \nlaws, which is the case here.  Id. at 32a–33a. \n\n3.  Petitioners do not attempt to defend these errors.  \nThey ignore them, and instead quote—five times—the \nSecond  Circuit’s  observation  that,  had  the  Ministry \nnot appeared in the litigation, the district court’s ap-\nproach  “would  have  been  entirely  appropriate.”    Pet. \nApp. 30a n.10.  Petitioners attempt to spin this into a \n“concession”  that  the  Second  Circuit’s  decision  was \n“[b]ased  solely  on  the  standard  of  ‘binding  deference’ \n\n8 The  Second  Circuit  was  clearly  correct.    We  do  not  decide \nwhether  theft  is  prohibited  by  counting  shoplifting  incidents. \nStealing is illegal, yet it occurs frequently.  Contra Pet. Br. 10–\n11.  Indeed, Petitioners quote the head of the Vitamin C Subcom-\nmittee  urging  “government  departments  to  assist  chambers  of \ncommerce in asserting their authority, so that [the chambers] can \npunish [noncompliant] companies.”  Id. at 12 (first alteration in \noriginal).  This shows not that compulsion was absent, but that \nenforcement was challenging. \n\n \n                                            \n\f27 \n\nthat it imposed.” Pet. Br. 58–59.  Not so.  The Second \nCircuit  determined  correctly  that  the  district  court \nadopted a “nonsensical” interpretation of Chinese law. \nIt simply noted hypothetically that if the Ministry had \nnot  appeared,  the  district  court’s  approach  of  “at-\ntempt[ing] to parse … China’s complex vitamin C mar-\nket regulatory framework” would have been “appropri-\nate.”  Pet. App. 29a–30a & n.10.  The district court’s \nerroneous conclusions received no blessing.  \n\n4.  The district court also offered misguided reasons \n\nfor rejecting the Ministry’s interpretation. \n\nFirst, the district court criticized the Ministry’s 2009 \nstatement  as  “undeserving  of  deference”  because  the \ncourt believed it lacked citations.  Pet. App. 119a–20a.  \nBut the 2009 statement expressly invoked and reiter-\nated the arguments in the Ministry’s two prior submis-\nsions, JA247–48, which provided much of the specific \ncitation to Chinese law that the district court appeared \nto seek, Pet. App. 189a–223a; JA131–33.   \n\nSecond,  the  district  court  said  the  2009  statement \ncontained  “ambiguous  terms  and  phrases,”  Pet.  App. \n120a, particularly as to the meaning and consequences \nof  non-compliance  with  “self-discipline,”  id.  at  132a–\n33a.    Both  the  Ministry  and  Respondents’  expert  ex-\nplained these points, and the district court’s desire to \nsee them spelled out in “a published series of specific \nconduct-dictating prohibitions or compulsions with an \nidentified sanctions system,” Pet. App. 116a, was un-\nrealistic.  In China, as in the United States, not all im-\nportant legal concepts are set forth in positive enact-\nments; for example, what statute would an American \nlawyer cite to prove the existence of non-retroactivity \nor qualified immunity? \n\nThird,  the  district  court  said  the  Ministry’s  2009 \nstatement failed to “distinguish between” the 1997 and \n\n \n\f28 \n\n2002  regulatory  regimes,  Pet.  App.  120a,  a  criticism \nPetitioners reprise here (at 14–15).  But the Ministry’s \namicus  brief—which  contained  separate  sections  de-\nscribing  the  1997  “Initial  Regulations”  and  the  2002 \n“Revised  Regulation[s]”—made  clear  that  the  2002 \namendments  “changed  the  way  in  which  compliance \nwith  the  [Chamber  of  Commerce  of  Medicines  & \nHealth  Products  Importers  &  Exporters’]  ‘coordina-\ntion’ was confirmed.”  Pet. App. 203a, 208a.  Under the \nnew  price-verification-and-chop  system,  or  PVC,  the \nChamber verified each manufacturer’s “contract price \nand volume”:  “If the price was at or above the mini-\nmum acceptable price set by coordination through the \nChamber, the Chamber affixed a special seal, known \nas a ‘chop,’ on the contract and returned it to the man-\nufacturer.”  Id. at 208a–09a.  Export was allowed “only \nif the contract bore the Chamber’s ‘chop’”; noncompli-\nance thus meant “denial by Customs of the ability to \nexport.”  Id. at 209a.9 \n\nAs before, the 2002 regime was adopted to “promote \nindustry self-discipline,” now based on “industry-wide \nnegotiated prices for those export products subject to \nprice review.”  JA99–100; see Pet. App. 208a.  It was \nthus  based  on  the  same  basic  concept  as  before,  but \nimplemented  differently.    Petitioners  make  much  of \nthe  fact  that  the  1997  Charter’s  requirement  to \n“[s]trictly  execute”  the  coordinated  price  was  “abol-\nished”  (Pet.  Br.  15  (alteration  in  original)  (emphasis \nomitted)),  but  neglect  to  mention  the  “resolution” \nadopted at a Chamber-led meeting in late 2001 that, \nunder the PVC regime, “[t]he committed export volume \nas  part  of  the  industry  self-discipline  shall  be  strictly \n\n9 Amici Howson and Clarke suggest (at 21) that Customs might \nhave refused to enforce a regime established by Ministry regula-\ntions  alone, but ignore that  the 2002 Notice issued jointly from \nboth departments, JA99. \n\n \n                                            \n\f29 \n\nimplemented.”  JA459.  Non-compliant exporters “will \nbe punished.”  Id. \n\nFurther, Petitioners’ explanation of the 2002 regime \nmakes no sense.  Petitioners urge the same “nonsensi-\ncal”  view  the  Second  Circuit  rejected:    That  even \nthough the PVC regime permitted export only “if the \ncontract met or exceeded an industry-determined min-\nimum export price,” it allowed manufacturers to “opt-\nout” and “did not prohibit exports in the event that [the \nindustry]  declined  to  reach  a  price  agreement  in  the \nfirst place.”  Pet. Br. 8–9.  Such a regulatory program \nwould be pointless.  Pet. App. 27a–28a.  And the sup-\nposed “opt-out” provision does not say what Petitioners \nclaim:    It  permits  the  suspension  of  price  review  by \n“the customs and chambers,” not by individual manu-\nfacturers.  JA100.  There is no allegation that the reg-\nulators ever exercised this authority.  Nor could man-\nufacturers “opt-out” by resigning from the subcommit-\ntee (Pet. Br. 8–9); non-members were also bound to fol-\nlow  the  industry-wide  negotiated  prices  because  fail-\nure  to  do  so  would  result  in  the  denial  of  a  chop.  \nJA105–06. \n\nPetitioners’ reliance on the supposed plain language \nof the 2002 documents is, like the district court’s, mis-\nplaced:  Petitioners simply assume that Chinese terms \nwhich translate as, e.g., “voluntary,” mean what they \nwould mean to a U.S. lawyer.  E.g., Pet. Br. 7, 9.  These \nmisguided assumptions are not a sound basis to reject \nthe  Chinese  government’s  official  explanation  (sup-\nported by expert testimony) of what these terms actu-\nally mean.  E.g., JA139 (Chinese legal expert explain-\ning:    “In  no  way  was  participation  in  the  process … \n‘voluntary’ in the sense that it could be ignored.”). \n\nFourth,  the  district  court  said,  and  Petitioners  ar-\ngue,  that  the  Ministry’s  position  here  is  inconsistent \nwith China’s statements to the WTO that it “gave up \n\n \n\f30 \n\n‘export administration … of vitamin C’ as of January \n1,  2002.”    Pet.  App.  120a–21a  (omission  in  original); \nPet. Br. 9, 19, 21, 53.  This view reflects the same mis-\nunderstanding as above:  The “export administration” \nChina gave up was not the policy of industrial self-dis-\ncipline  that  required  price  and  output  coordination, \nbut  rather—as  the  WTO  later  found—the  system  of \n“export quotas and licences” for Vitamin C that China \nhad followed until 2002.  WTO, Trade Policy Review: \nPeople’s Republic of China, WT/TPR/S/161, ¶ 141 (Feb. \n28,  2006),  https://goo.gl/iPtMaZ.10    The  2002  Notice \nthus explained that, “in order to accommodate the new \nsituations  since  China’s  entry  into  WTO”  while  still \n“promot[ing] industry self-discipline,” certain products \nwere “no longer subject to supervision and review by \nthe customs” but were instead “subject to [PVC] by the \nchambers.”    JA99  (emphasis  added);  JA428–29  (de-\nscribing the replacement of the 1997 “export licensing” \nregime with the PVC regime).   \n\nThe United States agreed.  In a 2009 WTO proceed-\ning related to raw materials, it relied on the Ministry’s \namicus brief in this case to argue that “China coordi-\nnates export prices for the products at issue through a \n‘system of self-discipline’ based on informal statements \nand oral agreements between traders and export reg-\nulators and where the [relevant chamber of commerce] \ndirects  commodity-specific  branches  or  coordination \n\n10 Amici Clarke and Howson, who claim no trade-law expertise \n(at 1–2), flatly ignore WTO’s summation in declaring it “inescap-\nable”  (at  17)  that  China  made  inconsistent  statements.    They \nseem not to have considered the possibility that their lay under-\nstanding of trade-law terminology is incorrect.   \n\n \n                                            \n\f31 \n\ngroups.”  JA676  (emphasis  added).11    The  WTO  ac-\ncepted that position, holding that “China requires ex-\nporting enterprises to export at set or coordinated ex-\nport  prices  or  otherwise  face  penalties.”    JA722.12  \nThus, the United States and the WTO both said what \nMOFCOM has maintained here: after 2002, China was \nstill  requiring  exporters  to  follow  a  price-setting  re-\ngime, albeit one that took a different form than before. \n\nThere is thus no inconsistency that could undermine \nthe Ministry’s position.  But the district court’s error \nwas more fundamental.  Even if China’s statement re-\ngarding  giving  up  “export  administration”  could  be \nread  as  connoting  an  abandonment  of  every  form  of \nprice or output control for Vitamin C, including indus-\ntrial self-discipline, that would at most establish that \nthe  reading  pressed  by  Petitioners  and  embraced  by \nthe  district  court  is  possible.    Petitioners  have  never \nidentified  any  evidence  that  anyone  contemporane-\nously  read  the  “export  administration”  statement  as \nthey do, and all evidence is that WTO participants did \nnot.  In such circumstances, a court should endeavor \nto reconcile the foreign sovereign’s statements, rather \n\n11 See  also  First  Written  Submission  of  the  United  States  of \nAmerica, China—Measures Related To The Exportation Of Vari-\nous Raw Materials, WT/DS394/DS395/DS398 ¶ 208 & nn.284–90 \n(June 1, 2010), https://goo.gl/95Qiwv (relying heavily on the Min-\nistry’s brief); Opening Oral Statement of Complainants, China—\nMeasures  Related  to  the  Exportation  of  Various  Raw  Materials, \nWT/DS394/DS395/DS398  ¶ 31  (Aug.  31,  2010),  https://goo.gl/ \nGqkcp6 (arguing that China maintained “a system that prevents \nexportation unless the seller meets or exceeds the minimum ex-\nport price”). \n\n12 This  holding  belies  the  notion  that  the  raw-materials  pro-\nceeding is distinguishable because it focused on whether conduct \nwas “attributable to,” rather than “required” by, China.  SG Br. \n31 n.7. \n\n \n                                            \n\f32 \n\nthan jump to the conclusion that the supposed incon-\nsistency is a product of deceitful intent.    Only if such \nreconciliation is impossible should the court consider \ndeclining to defer.  That slow-to-anger approach is sup-\nported by the accuracy and comity considerations dis-\ncussed  above,  and  fully  addresses  the  Solicitor  Gen-\neral’s  (rather  alarmist)  concern  that  foreign  govern-\nments  will  lightly  swap  positions  and  demand  defer-\nence at each turn.  See McNab Opp. at 18–19.  Because \nthere was no inconsistency here—much less an irrec-\noncilable one—the Second Circuit properly deferred to \nthe Ministry’s reasonable interpretation of the regula-\ntions it created. \n\nB.  The Ministry’s Authority To Interpret Its \n\nOwn Rules Is Beyond Dispute. \n\nPetitioners assert for the first time in this Court that \nthe  Ministry  may  lack  authority  to  interpret  its  own \nrules and directives.  This untimely argument is frivo-\nlous.  \n\nThe regulations and requirements at issue indisput-\nably fall within the Ministry’s jurisdiction as “the high-\nest authority within the Chinese Government author-\nized to regulate foreign trade.”  Pet. App. 6a; Foreign \nTrade  Law,  art.  3  (promulgated  by  Standing  Comm. \nNat’l  People’s  Cong.,  May  12,  1994,  revised  Apr.  6, \n2004),  https://goo.gl/sHn37U  (“The  [Ministry]  is  in \ncharge of foreign trade throughout the country pursu-\nant  to  this  Law.”).    The  Ministry  “formulates  strate-\ngies, guidelines and policies concerning domestic and \nforeign trade and international economic cooperation, \ndrafts and enforces laws and regulations governing do-\nmestic and foreign trade, and regulates market opera-\ntion,” and until 2008 the Chamber operated “under the \nMinistry’s direct and active supervision” as part of “a \nregulatory  pricing  regime  mandated  by  the  govern-\n\n \n\f33 \n\nment of China.”  Pet. App. 190a–91a, 196a–97a.  Re-\nspondents’  expert  testified  below,  without  contradic-\ntion, that the Ministry’s “interpretation of its own reg-\nulations  and  policies  carries  decisive  weight  under \nChinese  law.”    JA142.    He  was  correct.    In  2001, \nChina’s State Council promulgated rulemaking proce-\ndures that empower the Ministry to make and inter-\npret its own regulations.  See Add. 24–25, Decree of the \nState  Council,  People’s  Republic  of  China  (No.  322), \nRegulations  on  Procedures  for  Formulation  of  Rules, \nart. 33 (effective Jan. 1, 2002) (“The power to interpret \nrules belongs to the formulating organs of rules.… In-\nterpretations of rules have the same force and effect as \nthe rules themselves.”).13 \n\nFurther,  the  Chinese  diplomatic  note  submitted  to \nthe Second Circuit, JA782–84, underscored the point: \nThe  Ministry’s  brief  stated  “the  official  views  of  the \nPeople’s Republic of China,” JA131.  China spoke here \nwith  one  voice,  and  the  Second  Circuit  correctly  de-\nferred  to  the  Ministry’s  reasonable  interpretation  of \nChinese law.   \n\n13 The English translation in the Addendum was performed by \nPeking University Law School and retrieved from a Chinese com-\nmercial legal database, http://www.lawinfochina.com/, on March \n20, 2018. \n\n \n \n \n                                            \n\f34 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor these reasons and those stated in Respondents’ \n\nbrief, the Court should affirm the judgment below. \n\n    Respectfully submitted, \n\nJOEL M.
