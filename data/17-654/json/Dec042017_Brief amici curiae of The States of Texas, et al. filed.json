Bevin.1  The  States  have  an  interest  in \ncooperating with the federal  government to establish a \nconsistent  and  correct  understanding  of  the  rights  of \naliens  unlawfully  present  in  the  United  States,  as  the \nStates  “bear[]  many  of  the  consequences  of  unlawful \nimmigration.”  Arizona  v.  United  States,  567  U.S.  387, \n397  (2012).  The  States  also  have  “a  legitimate  and \nsubstantial  interest  in  preserving  and  promoting  fetal \nlife,”  as  well  as  an  “interest  in  promoting  respect  for \nhuman  life  at  all  stages  in  the  pregnancy.” Gonzales  v. \nCarhart, 550 U.S. 124, 145, 163 (2007). \n\nsustained—a \n\ncourt  of  appeals \n\nIn  this  case,  the  district  court  entered—and  the  en \ntemporary \nbanc \nrestraining  order  effectively  declaring  that  the  U.S. \nConstitution  confers  on  unlawfully-present  aliens  the \nright  to  an  elective  abortion  that  is  not  medically \nnecessary—even when they have no ties to this country \nother  than  the  fact  of  their  arrest  while  attempting  to \ncross  the  border  unlawfully.

        "2 \n\nbroad rights for unlawfully-present aliens with virtually \nno  connections  to  the  country.  Under  the  reasoning  of \nthe courts below, there will be no meaningful limit on the \nconstitutional  rights  an  unlawfully-present  alien  can \ninvoke simply by attempting to enter this country. This \nrelief  also  contradicts \nlongstanding \nprecedent that full Fifth Amendment rights accorded to \ncitizens can only be extended to those aliens who “have \ncome  within  the  territory  of  the  United  States  and \ndeveloped  substantial  connections  with  this  country.” \nUnited  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez,  494  U.S.  259,  271 \n(1990) (emphasis added). \n\nthe  Court’s \n\nAmici  thus  urge  the  Court  to  vacate  the  court  of \n\nappeals’ judgment.",
        "3 \n\nS U M M A R Y   O F   A R G U M E N T \n\nThe  decisions  below  are  unprecedented.  Until  now, \nno  court  had  ever  declared  that  the  Constitution  gives \nunlawfully-present  aliens  with  virtually  no  ties  to  this \ncountry  the  full  scope  of  affirmative  liberty  rights  ac-\ncorded  to  citizens.  The  district  court  and  the  en  banc \ncourt of appeals thus broke new ground by holding that \nan unlawfully-present alien with virtually no ties to this \ncountry has a constitutional right to an elective abortion. \nThis Court should vacate the court of appeals’ order \nbecause the Constitution does not confer the right to an \nelective abortion on unlawfully-present aliens with virtu-\nally no ties to the country, as Judge Henderson’s dissent \nbelow  rightly  concluded.  Under  long-settled  doctrine, \nthe constitutional rights an alien may invoke depend on \nthe scope of the alien’s ties to this country. It is true that \nall  persons—regardless  of  immigration  status,  and  re-\ngardless of their ties here—have certain cabined consti-\ntutional rights, including baseline procedural protections \nand the right to be free from gross physical abuse. But \nthat  does  not  mean  that  such  unlawfully-present  aliens \nare  accorded  the  panoply  of  affirmative  liberty  rights \nthat citizens and lawfully-present aliens possess.  \n\nThe  States—and  the  State  of  Texas  in  particular—\nare  already  spending  enormous  resources  dealing  with \nunlawful  immigration.  The  court  of  appeals’  decision, \nthough, creates a perverse incentive to unlawfully enter \nthe country. This will further add to the substantial bur-\nden faced by the governmental entities trying to prevent \nand deal with unlawful immigration.",
        "4 \n\nA R G U M E N T \n\nI.  Unlawfully-Present Aliens with Virtually No Con-\nnections  to  the  United  States  Have  No  Constitu-\ntional Right To An Elective Abortion. \n\nThe Court should vacate the decision below because \nthe right asserted does not exist: Unlawfully-present al-\niens with virtually no connections to the country do not \nhave  a  constitutional  right  to  an  elective  abortion.  The \ndistrict court necessarily erred in entering—and the en \nbanc court of appeals erred in upholding—the temporary \nrestraining  order.  See  Winter  v.  NRDC,  555  U.S.  7,  20 \n(2008)  (preliminary  injunctive  relief  unavailable  if  the \nplaintiff  cannot  establish  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the \nmerits); Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 970 (1997) \n(per curiam) (same). \n\n  The  Decisions  Below  Overrode  This  Court’s \nLong-Settled  “Substantial  Connections”  Test, \nWhich  Provides  That  the  Degree  of  Connec-\ntions to This Country Determines the Degree of \nFifth Amendment Rights Accorded to Aliens. \n\nThe  “initial  inquiry”  in  assessing  any  due  process \nclaim is whether the Constitution protects the right the \nplaintiff  asserts.  See,  e.g.,  Meachum  v.  Fano,  427  U.S. \n215, 223-24 (1976). Only after confirming that the right \nat issue exists should a court move on to whether the gov-\nernment has violated that right. See id. The courts below \nthus should have begun their analysis by asking whether \nthe right to an elective abortion recognized by this Court \napplies  to  unlawfully-present  aliens  with  virtually  no \nconnections to this country who were apprehended while \nattempting to cross the border.",
        "5 \n\nThe  answer  to  that  question,  as  Judge  Henderson \ncorrectly  concluded,  is  “plainly—and  easily—no.”  Pet. \nApp. 35a. \n\n1.  The Constitutional Rights of Aliens are De-\ntermined  by  a  Sliding  Scale  Based  on  the \nDegree of Connections the Alien Has to the \nCountry.  \n\n The  Fifth  Amendment  provides  that  “[n]o  person \nshall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law.” This Court has held that unlawfully-\npresent  aliens  are  “persons”  protected  by  the  Fifth \nAmendment. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982). The \nCourt  reiterated  in  2001  that  “once  an  alien  enters  the \ncountry,  the  legal  circumstance  changes,  for  the  Due \nProcess Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within the United \nStates, including aliens, whether their presence here is \nlawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).2 \n\nBut  simply  because  an  individual  is  a  “person”  cov-\nered by the Fifth Amendment, it does not follow that the \nalien  is  necessarily  “due”  the  same  scope  of  rights  ac-\ncorded to citizens or lawfully-present aliens. This Court \nhas held that the rights an alien is “due” depend on the \nconnections that person has established with this coun-\ntry:  United  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez,  494  U.S.  259, \n270 (1990), clarified that Plyler’s Fifth Amendment anal-\nysis “establish[es] only that aliens receive constitutional \nprotections when they have come within the territory of \n\n2 Contrary to the statements in the panel dissent below, amici did \nnot argue that unlawfully-present aliens are not “persons.” Cf. Pet. \nApp. 16a.",
        "6 \n\nthe  United  States  and  developed  substantial  connec-\ntions with this country.” Id. at 271 (emphasis added).  \n\nVerdugo-Urquidez  emerged  from  this  Court’s  bed-\nrock rule that an alien is “accorded a generous and as-\ncending scale of rights as he increases his identity with \nour society.” Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 770 \n(1950) (emphasis added). In other words, as set out first \nin Eisentrager and explained by Verdugo-Urquidez, an \nalien’s connections determine the scope of rights the al-\nien is due. See id. As a person develops increasing con-\nnections  with  this  country,  the  person’s  constitutional \nprotections expand. E.g., Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at \n268-69; see also Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Pro-\nject, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (per curiam) (staying in-\njunction  of  immigration  order  for  aliens  “who  lack  any \nbona  fide  relationship  with  a  person  or  entity  in  the \nUnited  States”).  Initial  lawful  entry  affords  “safe  con-\nduct” and confers “certain rights,” which “become more \nextensive and secure when he makes preliminary decla-\nration of intention to become a citizen, and they expand \nto those of full citizenship upon naturalization.” Eisten-\ntrager, 339 U.S. at 770; see Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. \n21, 32 (1982) (alien’s “constitutional status changes” only \nafter  he  “gains  admission  to  our  country  and  begins  to \ndevelop the ties that go with permanent residence”).  \n\nNo decision of this Court or any other court has ab-\nrogated \nthat  basic  Eisentrager/Verdugo-Urquidez \nframework  of  a  sliding  scale  of  rights  based  on  the  de-\ngree of connections the alien has to the country. In par-\nticular,  Zadvydas  did  not  alter  or  undermine  Verdugo-\nUrquidez’s pronouncement that to invoke the full scope \nof Fifth Amendment rights, an unlawfully-present alien",
        "7 \n\nmust  demonstrate  “substantial  connections.”  See,  e.g., \nIbrahim  v.  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  669  F.3d  983,  997 \n(9th  Cir.  2012)  (applying  “significant  voluntary  connec-\ntion”  test  from  Verdugo-Urquidez);  United  States  v. \nMeza-Rodriguez, 798 F.3d 664, 670 (7th Cir. 2015), cert. \ndenied, 136 S. Ct. 1655 (2016) (same). In fact, Zadvydas \nexpressly limited its analysis to “aliens who were admit-\nted  to  the  United  States  but  subsequently  ordered  re-\nmoved.” 533 U.S. at 682 (emphasis added). By contrast, \n“[a]liens who have not yet gained initial admission to this \ncountry would present a very different question.” Id. \n\n2.  Unlawfully-Present  Aliens  With  Virtually \nNo  Connections  to  the  Country  Lack  the \nPanoply  of  Affirmatively  Liberty  Rights \nthat  Citizens  and  Lawfully-Present  Aliens \nPossess,  Although  They  Do  Have  Baseline \nProcedural Protections and the Right to be \nFree from Gross Physical Abuse. \n\na.  The sliding-scale approach set out in Eisentrager \nand Verdugo-Urquidez recognizes that it is the rare ex-\nception where constitutional rights  are  accorded  to  un-\nlawfully-present aliens with minimal connections to the \ncountry.  Under  that  rare  exception,  the  mere  fact  of \npresence in this country—even unlawful presence—does \nconfer  certain  baseline  constitutional  rights  against \negregious harm, but not affirmative liberty rights. And \neven  when  certain  limited  constitutional  rights  are  ex-\ntended  to  unlawfully-present  aliens,  courts  routinely \nhold  that  the  full  scope  of  a  constitutional  provisions’ \nrights do not extend to such aliens.",
        "8 \n\nFor example, mere unlawful presence confers a basic \nright against “gross physical abuse” in this country. Cas-\ntro v. Cabrera, 742 F.3d 595, 600 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing \nLynch  v.  Cannatella,  810  F.2d  1363,  1370  (5th  Cir. \n1987)). The Constitution protects everyone on U.S. soil, \neven unlawfully-present aliens with no other ties to this \ncountry,  against  the  “wanton  or  malicious  infliction  of \npain” by governmental officials. Id. \n\nThe panel dissent—which the en banc majority below \n“substantially”  adopted,  Pet.  App.  19a—argued  that \namici’s position would mean that the alien here and “eve-\nryone  else  here  without  lawful  documentation—includ-\ning  everyone  under  supervision  pending  immigration \nproceedings  and  all  Dreamers—have  no  constitutional \nright to bodily integrity in any form (absent criminal con-\nviction).”  Pet.  App.  16a.  But  that  does  not  follow  from \namici’s position, and this Court’s precedents do not lead \nto  that  drastic  outcome.  The  “deeply  troubling”  hypo-\ntheticals the panel dissent posited are thus fully resolved \nby a proper application of the Eisentrager/Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez framework. Cf. Pet. App. 16a. \n\nUnder the “ascending scale” of rights articulated in \nJohnson  (339  U.S.  at  770),  reinforced  in  Landon  (459 \nU.S.  at  32),  restated  in  Verdugo-Urquidez  (494  U.S.  at \n268-69)—and  applied  in  Lynch  (810  F.2d  at  1370)  and \nCastro  (742  F.  3d  at  600)—all  persons  on  U.S.  soil  are \nconstitutionally  protected  against  “gross  physical \nabuse.” Castro, 742 F.3d at 600. However, even though \nthe  Constitution  confers  basic  protection  against  gross \nphysical abuse, full Fourth Amendment rights accorded \nto citizens do not apply to unlawfully-present aliens with",
        "9 \n\nonly minimal connections to the country. See, e.g., Cas-\ntro,  742  F.3d  at  599-600  (Fourth  Amendment  does  not \nextend  to  unlawfully-present  aliens  who  remain  in  the \nUnited States illegally, unless they are raising claims of \n“gross physical abuse”); United States v. Vilches-Navar-\nrete,  523  F.3d  1,  13  (1st  Cir.  2008)  (criminal  defendant \nlacked  “substantial  connection”  with  U.S.  necessary  to \ninvoke  Fourth  Amendment  protection  under  Verdugo-\nUrquidez). \n\nIn  addition  to  the  gross-physical-abuse  prohibition, \nthe mere fact of presence in this country—even unlawful \npresence—also confers a certain set of basic procedural \nguarantees  before  the  federal  government  can  deport \nthe individual. See, e.g., Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 523 \n(2003) (it is “well established” that aliens have due-pro-\ncess rights in deportation hearings). But even then, the \nfull scope of procedural due process rights guaranteed to \ncitizens  does  not  extend  to  unlawfully-present  aliens. \nSee, e.g., id. at 521 (“‘In the exercise of its broad power \nover naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly \nmakes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to cit-\nizens.’”  (quoting  Mathews  v.  Diaz,  426  U.S.  67,  79-80 \n(1976)));  accord,  e.g.,  Zadvydas,  533  U.S.  at  718  (Ken-\nnedy, J., dissenting) (“The liberty rights of the aliens be-\nfore us here are subject to limitations and conditions not \napplicable  to  citizens,  however.”  (citing  Mathews,  426 \nU.S. at 79-80)). \n\nIn sum, the fact that basic procedural safeguards and \nprotections against “gross physical abuse” are afforded \nto everyone on U.S. soil does not mean that the full pan-\noply of constitutional rights accorded to citizens extends",
        "10 \n\nto each unlawfully-present alien with only minimal con-\nnections to the country. See Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. \nat 268-69. \n\nb.    Furthermore,  courts  routinely  hold  that  unlaw-\nfully-present  aliens  with  minimal  connections  to  the \ncountry lack affirmative liberty rights.  \n\nFor example, numerous courts have held that unlaw-\nfully-present  aliens  with  minimal  connections  to  the \ncountry do not have the Second Amendment “fundamen-\ntal  right”  (McDonald  v.  City  of  Chicago,  561  U.S.  742, \n778 (2010)) to keep and bear arms. United States v. Por-\ntillo–Munoz, 643 F.3d 437, 442 (5th Cir. 2011) as revised \n(June 29, 2011); United States v. Carpio–Leon, 701 F.3d \n974, 979 (4th Cir. 2012); United States v. Flores, 663 F.3d \n1022, 1023 (8th Cir. 2011) (per curiam); cf. Meza-Rodri-\nguez, 798 F.3d at 669-672 (unlawfully-present alien had \nSecond Amendment rights only because he arrived in the \nU.S. at a young age and lived here for 20 years). \n\nAnd full First Amendment rights do not extend to un-\nlawfully-present  aliens  without  substantial  connections \nto the country. See, e.g., Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. \n310, 362 (2010) (noting federal statute, now codified at 52 \nU.S.C.  §30121,  prohibiting  “foreign  national[s]”  from \nmaking  direct  contributions  or  independent  expendi-\ntures  for  political  speech);  Kleindienst  v.  Mandel,  408 \nU.S. 753, 769-70 (1972) (alien may be returned to home \ncountry for engaging in disfavored political speech in this \ncountry); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (gov-\nernment may restrict alien’s freedom of association).  \n\nThe  Department  of  Justice  has  explicitly  advanced \nthis view in previous litigation. See Federal Defendants’ \nMemorandum  in  Opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for",
        "11 \n\nTRO at 13, Pineda-Cruz v. Thompson, No. 5:15-cv-00326 \n(W.D.  Tex.  May  7,  2015)  (Dkt.  22)  (“Because  Plaintiffs \nnever gained entry into the United States and have not \ndeveloped  substantial  connections  with  this  country, \nthey are not within the scope of individuals contemplated \nby the Supreme Court as being able to raise claims under \nthe First Amendment.”). In fact, the federal government \nhas, on dozens of occasions, argued that unlawfully-pre-\nsent aliens lack the full scope of constitutional rights af-\nforded to citizens. See infra Part II.B.2. \n\nThese principles establishing that unlawfully-present \naliens  lack  affirmative  liberty  rights  held  by  citizens \ncomport with this Court’s declaration that aliens subject \nto  deportation  may  be  detained  as  their  deportation  is \nprocessed. See, e.g., Kim, 538 U.S. at 523 (“At the same \ntime, however, this Court has recognized detention dur-\ning  deportation  proceedings  as  a  constitutionally  valid \naspect  of  the  deportation  process.”).  With  physical  de-\ntention necessarily comes a restriction of liberties. \n\nc.  The affirmative substantive due process right rec-\nognized by the Court to seek the medical procedure of an \nelective abortion is much more analogous to the affirma-\ntive liberty rights courts have repeatedly held are not ac-\ncorded to unlawfully-present aliens who lack substantial \nconnections to the country. In contrast, baseline proce-\ndural safeguards and the basic protection against gross \nphysical abuse are negative prohibitions on drastic gov-\nernment  conduct  (detention  and  removal  without  any \nprocess, and gross physical abuse). \n\nRespondent  has  never  offered  any  authority  to  the \ncontrary. In the proceedings below, respondent argued \nthat the alien’s immigration status has no impact at all",
        "12 \n\non  the  constitutional  rights  she  may  assert.  That  is \nwrong, as the authorities above confirm. Moreover, the \nauthorities respondent relied on below do not establish \nthe right to an elective abortion. \n\nRespondent relied on various abortion cases, includ-\ning  Planned  Parenthood  of  Se.  Pa.  v.  Casey,  505  U.S. \n833,  871  (1992)  (plurality  op.),  for  the  proposition  that \n“the government may not prohibit any woman from mak-\ning the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy be-\nfore  viability.”  Plaintiff’s  Memorandum  in  Support  of \nHer Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and \nMotion  for  Preliminary  Injunction,  Garza  v.  Hargan, \nNo. 1:17-cv-02122 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 2017) Dkt. 3-2 at 9-10 \n(citing  Casey,  505  U.S.  at  871  (plurality  op.);  Whole \nWoman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt,  136  S.  Ct.  2292  (2016); \nPlanned Parenthood of Cent. Missouri v. Danforth, 428 \nU.S. 52, 74 (1976), and Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 633 \nn.12 (1979)). But not one of respondent’s cited cases says \nor implies that the substantive due process right to abor-\ntion recognized by this Court extends to unlawfully-pre-\nsent aliens—especially not those who have no ties to this \ncountry.  \n\nRespondent further offered a string citation of cases, \nbut none of those cases support the proposition that un-\nlawfully-present aliens have the right to an elective abor-\ntion. R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 187 (D.D.C. \n2015), for example, concerned whether the government \ncould continue to detain asylum applicants after those in-\ndividuals  had  demonstrated  a  credible  fear  of  persecu-\ntion. Each of the applicants had family members in the \nUnited  States  who  had  agreed  to  provide  shelter  and \nsupport  for  the  asylum-seekers.  On  those  facts,  and  in",
        "13 \n\nlight of the plaintiffs’ threshold showing of asylum eligi-\nbility, the district court held that they could invoke the \nprotection of the Due Process Clause. Here, the opera-\ntive complaint says nothing about asylum, alleges no con-\nnection to the U.S. at all, and offers no basis to believe \nthat the alien is on track to permanent residence.  \n\nRespondent’s  other  authorities  fare  no  better.  Re-\nspondent claimed the alleged abortion right was derived \nfrom Plyler, 457 U.S. at 210. But as explained above, this \nCourt  explicitly  clarified  and  supplanted  Plyler  in  Ver-\ndugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 270-71. So too with Mathews, \n426 U.S. at 77, which concerned resident aliens who were \nlawfully  admitted  to  the  United  States;  plus,  Mathews \ntoo was clarified and supplanted by Verdugo-Urquidez. \nAnd Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 971 \n(9th Cir. 2004), concerned an alien who had been lawfully \npresent  in  the  U.S.  for  almost  two  decades—in  other \nwords,  someone  who  had  established  “substantial  con-\nnections” under Verdugo-Urquidez. \n\nIn short, none of respondent’s cited authorities sup-\nport  the  extraordinary  constitutional  holding  in  the \ncourts below.  \n\n  The  Operative  Complaint  Confirmed  that  the \nAlien At Issue Here Had No “Substantial Con-\nnections”  to  This  Country,  and  Therefore  Had \nNo Right to an Elective Abortion. \n\nThe operative Complaint (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 1) confirmed \nthat  that  alien  here  had  no  other  connection  to  the \nUnited States:",
        "14 \n\n  Paragraphs 4 and 5 summarized the aliens’ situa-\ntion but offered no allegations establishing a con-\nnection to the United States other than her unlaw-\nful presence. \n\n  Paragraph 13 alleged: “J.D. was detained by the \nfederal  government  and  placed  in  a  federally \nfunded  shelter  in  Texas.  J.D.  is  years  [sic]  old, \npregnant, and told the staff at the shelter where \nshe is currently housed that she wanted an abor-\ntion.” This paragraph admitted that the alien en-\ntered the United States unlawfully but offered no \nallegations  establishing  a  connection  to  the \nUnited States. \n\n  Paragraphs 14 and 15 discussed the alien’s efforts \nto obtain an abortion during her time in custody. \n  Paragraphs 33, 34, 35, 36, and 43 alleged that the \ndefendants restricted the alien’s ability to receive \nan abortion in the United States. \n\nThe alien even admitted below that that she has “no \nlegal immigration status.” Declaration, Dist. Ct. Dkt. 3-2 \nat 3. And the declaration that the alien submitted in sup-\nport of her motion for a temporary restraining order con-\nfirmed no substantial ties to this country: The alien ex-\nplicitly admitted she was “detained upon arrival.” Dist. \nCt. Dkt. 3-3 ¶ 4.  \n\nThose undisputed facts should have resolved this case \n“plainly”  and  “easily,”  as  Judge  Henderson  recognized \nbelow. Pet. App. 35a. Under Verdugo-Urquidez, the alien \nmust show “substantial connections” to assert full Fifth \nAmendment  affirmative  liberty  rights.  494  U.S.  at  271. \nShe did not do so. See Dist. Ct. Dkt. 1. She thus stands at",
        "15 \n\nthe start of the “ascending scale of rights” that individu-\nals climb as they “increase[] [their] identity with our so-\nciety.”  Eisentrager,  339  U.S.  at  770.  At  that  level,  the \nConstitution protects her against “gross physical abuse” \nin this country. Castro, 742 F. 3d at 600. The Constitution \nfurther  confers  some  basic  procedural  guarantees  re-\nlated  to  her  deportation  proceedings.  Kim,  538  U.S.  at \n523.  But  as  Verdugo-Urquidez,  Eisentrager,  and  Kim \nconfirm, it does not accord the affirmative liberty right \nto an elective abortion.  \n\nII.  The  Court  of  Appeals  Did  Not  Even  Cite  This \nCourt’s “Substantial Connections” Test, Which Is \nWell Accepted.  \n\nThe  court  below  entirely  overlooked  the  bedrock \nprinciples  articulated  in  Eisentrager  and  Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez, even though those principles confirm that an un-\nlawfully-present alien with virtually no ties to this coun-\ntry has no right to an elective abortion. That “initial in-\nquiry,” Meachum, 427 U.S. at 223-24, appears nowhere \nin any decision below. The fact that the court of appeals \nnot only reached the wrong result, but also applied the \nfundamentally wrong framework, is further grounds to \nvacate its judgment. See United States v. Munsingwear, \n340 U.S. 36, 40-41 (1950).3 \n\n3 Amici fully briefed this Verdugo-Urquidez framework to the \ncourts below. See Br. for Texas et al., Garza v. Hargan, No. 1:17-\ncv-02122-TSC (D.D.C.) (Oct. 17, 2017); Br. for Texas et al., Garza \nv. Hargan, No. 17-5236 (D.C. Cir.) (Oct. 19, 2017).",
        "16 \n\n  The Courts Below Had a Duty to Apply the Cor-\n\nrect Law.  \n\nAs Judge Henderson’s dissent recognized, Pet. App. \n35a, 42a, regardless of what the parties have argued, the \ncourt of appeals should have decided the predicate con-\nstitutional  question  before  issuing  such  a  momentous \nholding. See,  e.g.,  U.S.  Nat’l  Bank  of  Or.  v.  Indep.  Ins. \nAgents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 447 (1993) (if a party \n“fail[s] to identify and brief” “an issue ‘antecedent to . . . \nand ultimately dispositive of’ the dispute,” an appellate \ncourt  may  consider  the  issue  sua  sponte  (citation  omit-\nted)). After all, “even an explicit concession on this point \nwould not ‘“relieve this Court of the performance of the \njudicial  function”’  of  deciding  the  issues.”  Torres  v. \nPuerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 471 n.3 (1979) (quoting Sibron \nv. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 59 (1968)). Moreover, a govern-\nment’s “concessions cannot be accepted” when they are \ncontrary  to  law.  Massachusetts  v.  United  States,  333 \nU.S. 611, 625 (1948).  \n\nIn short, regardless of what the parties argued, the \ncourt  of  appeals  was  still  required  to  apply  the  correct \nlegal  framework.  See  id.  Because  the  court  of  appeals’ \nwholly incorrect framework is now law, it should be set \naside. \n\n  The  “Substantial  Connections”  Test  Is  Widely \nCited and Applied as Controlling. \n\n1.  The court of appeals’ failure here to address the \nVerdugo-Urquidez substantial-connections, sliding-scale \ntest is particularly striking given that other circuits uni-\nformly and routinely apply this controlling test when de-\ntermining  whether  aliens  can  assert  constitutional",
        "17 \n\nrights. E.g., Meza-Rodriguez, 798 F.3d at 670; Ibrahim, \n669  F.3d  at  995;  United  States  v.  Huitron-Guizar,  678 \nF.3d  1164,  1166  (10th  Cir.  2012);  Portillo-Munoz,  643 \nF.3d at 440; Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d at 13; Atamir-\nzayeva v. United States, 524 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. \n2008);  Nat’l  Council  of  Resistance  of  Iran  v.  Dep’t  of \nState, 251 F.3d 192, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  \n\nAs these citations demonstrate, the arguments amici \nand  Judge  Henderson  advanced  simply  reflect  basic \nprinciples that have governed the rights of aliens for dec-\nades. \n\n2.  In conformance with the circuits’ widespread ad-\nherence  to  this  Court’s  established  precedent,  the  De-\npartment  of  Justice  has  relied  on  Verdugo-Urquidez’s \nsubstantial-connections  test  dozens  of  times  to  argue \nthat  unlawfully-present  aliens  without  sufficient  ties  to \nthe country lack constitutional rights.  \n\nJust  months  ago,  the  Department  argued  in  this \n\nCourt that:  \n\n[A]n alien arrested shortly after crossing the U.S. \nborder surreptitiously cannot lay the same claim \nto  constitutional  protections  as  aliens  who  were \nlawfully  admitted  or  who  entered  illegally  then \nbecame,  “in  a[]  real  sense,  a  part  of  our  popula-\ntion[.]”  \n\nBrief for the Respondents in Opposition, Castro v.

See, e.g., Brief \nfor  the  United  States,  Hernandez  v.  Mesa,  137  S.  Ct. \n2003 (2017) (No. 15-118), 2017 WL 104588 at *35 (arguing",
        "18 \n\nthat, under Verdugo-Urquidez, aliens are “afforded con-\nstitutional protections only when ‘they ha[d] come within \nthe  territory  of  the  United  States  and  developed  sub-\nstantial  connections  with  this  country’”);  Transcript  of \nOral  Argument  at  17,  Jennings  v.

E.g., Reply in \nSupport of Appellants’ Brief, Flores v.

E.g.,  Brief  for  the  United \nStates  as  Appellee,  United  States  v.  Torres,  No. \n15-10492  (9th  Cir.

App’x  684  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (No.  08-50461), \n2008  WL  6822006  (defendant’s  rights  “should \nhave  turned  on  objective  factors  and  practical \nconcerns, such as his citizenship, lack of substan-\ntial ties to the United States . . . .

The court of appeals’ failure to \neven recognize, let alone apply, the proper legal frame-\nwork  confirms  that  its  decision  should  be  vacated.  See \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41. \n\nIII.  If  Left  in  Place,  the  Decision  Below  Will \nExacerbate  Unlawful  Immigration  and  Further \nStrain the States’ Limited Resources. \n\nAs  this  Court  has  recognized,  the  States  already \n“bear[] many of the consequences of unlawful immigra-\ntion.”  Arizona,  567  U.S.  at  397.  In  short,  “[t]he  States \nlose badly needed tax dollars each year due to the pres-\nence of illegal aliens—a clear drain upon their already-\ntaxed resources.” Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d \n591, 631 (S.D. Tex.), aff’d, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), as",
        "22 \n\nrevised (Nov. 25, 2015), aff’d by an equally divided court, \n136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam). If allowed to stand, \nthe court of appeals’ decision will only exacerbate those \nlosses by inviting everyone who reaches this country un-\nlawfully—no  matter  how  briefly—to  demand  the  full \nscope of constitutional rights. \n\nThe  State  of  Texas,  in  particular,  already  expends \nsubstantial resources trying to deal with unlawful immi-\ngration.  Two  decades  ago,  the  Fifth  Circuit  recognized \nthat  Texas’  “educational,  medical,  and  criminal  justice \nexpenditures on undocumented aliens” were over a bil-\nlion  dollars  annually.  Texas  v.  United  States,  106  F.3d \n661,  664  (5th  Cir.  1997).  And  “in  2008,  Texas  incurred \n$716,800,000 in uncompensated medical care provided to \nillegal aliens.” Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 630.   \n\nThe State of Texas continues to incur these stagger-\ning costs caused by unlawful immigration. For example, \nduring  the  2013  fiscal  year  (the  most  recent  year  for \nwhich such data has been compiled) the State of Texas \nalone  spent  approximately  $90  million  on  emergency \nMedicaid  services  for  unlawfully-present  aliens.  See \nTexas Health and Human Services Commission, Report \non Texas Health and Human Services Commission Ser-\nvices  and  Benefits  Provided  to  Undocumented  Immi-\nhttps://hhs.texas.gov/re-\ngrants \nports/2015/02/report-health-and-human-services-com-\nmission-services-and-benefits-provided-undocumented-\nimmigrants. That was almost a $20 million increase over \nthe $71 million spent on such services in 2011, and almost \na  50%  increase  over  the  $62  million  spent  on  such  ser-\nvices  in  2009.  Id.  The  State  of  Texas  further  spent  ap-\nproximately  $38  million  during  the  2013  fiscal  year \n\n2014), \n\n(Dec.",
        "23 \n\nproviding coverage for perinatal care. That was millions \nmore  than  it  spent  in  2011  ($35  million)  and  2009  ($33 \nmillion). Id.  \n\nWhen more benefits are given to unlawfully-present \naliens,  it  will  incentivize  even  more  aliens  to  enter  the \ncountry unlawfully and “will increase the number of in-\ndividuals  that  demand  them.”  Texas,  86  F.  Supp.  3d  at \n634.  The  State’s  Health  and  Human  Services  Commis-\nsion has thus correctly projected the estimated sums will \ncontinue to rise as the number of unlawfully-present al-\niens increases within the State’s borders. See Plaintiff’s \nReply in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction at \n53,  Texas  v.  U.S.,  86  F. Supp. 3d  591  (S.D.  Tex.  2015) \n(No.  1:14-cv-00254).  Plus,  unlawfully-present  aliens  are \nless likely to have health insurance and are more likely \nto rely on emergency rooms or public clinics for health \ncare. Congressional Budget Office, The Impact of Unau-\nthorized Immigrants on the Budgets of State and Local \nGovernments (Dec. 2007), at 8, https://www.cbo.gov/pub-\nlication/41645.  \n\nThe rapid increase in unaccompanied minors such as \nthe  alien  here  accounts  for  much  of  those  cost  trends. \nFrom 2011 to 2014, the number of unaccompanied minors \napprehended  at  the  border  more  than  quadrupled—\nfrom 17,109 in 2011 to 73,741 in 2014. U.S. Government \nAccountability  Office,  Unaccompanied  Children:  HHS \nCan Take Further Actions to Monitor Their Care, GAO-\n16-180  (Feb.  2016),  at  4,  https://www.gao.gov/prod-\nucts/GAO-16-180.  Of  those  73,741,  nearly  57,500  were \nturned over to the care of the Office of Refugee Resettle-\nment. Id. at 1. This rapid increase “has at times strained",
        "24 \n\nORR’s capacity to find shelter beds,” id. at 2, and “cre-\nated challenges for the communities in which these chil-\ndren  are  eventually  placed.”  Id.  Furthermore,  the  in-\ncrease in facilities combined with insufficient resources \nhave prevented ORR from performing required on-site \nmonitoring of facilities, in some cases for several years. \nId. at 26-27. \n\nLarge influxes of unaccompanied minors also strain \nStates’ education resources. The State of Texas bears the \ncost of about $9,473 per child for the public education of \nunlawfully-present alien children. Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d \nat  630.  From  October  2013  to  September  2014,  “Texas \nabsorbed  additional  education  costs  of  at \nleast \n$58,531,100 stemming from illegal immigration.” Id.  \n\nThe  costs  are  not  just  financial.  This  Court  in  Ari-\nzona  recognized  the  “disproportionate  share  of  serious \ncrime”  committed  by  unlawfully-present  aliens  in  Ari-\nzona’s  most  populous  county.  567  U.S.  at  398.  Indeed, \n“there  is  an  ‘epidemic  of  crime,  safety  risks,  serious \nproperty  damage,  and  environmental  problems’  associ-\nated  with  the  influx  of  illegal  migration  across  private \nland near the Mexican border.” Id. (citation omitted). \n\nStates like amici “cannot protect themselves from the \ncosts inflicted” by a massive uptick in the number of in-\ndividuals  able  “to  compel  state  action.”  Texas,  86  F. \nSupp. 3d at 620. That is why the States have consistently \nfought against any effort to “explicitly or impli[citly] so-\nlicit immigrants to enter the United States illegally.” Id. \nat 630.  \n\nYet the decision below does exactly that. The court of \nappeals’  decision  effectively  announces  that  anyone  on \nEarth has any number of constitutional rights simply by",
        "25 \n\nbeing  apprehended  while  trying  to  cross  the  United \nStates border unlawfully. This holding will make the un-\nlawful  immigration  crisis  worse  and  further  strain  the \nbudgets  and  resources  of  governments  throughout  the \nNation. \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nThe federal government has suggested that respond-\nent  counsel’s  efforts  to  thwart  this  Court’s  review  may \nwarrant disciplinary action. Pet. 26-28. The propriety of \nsuch action could turn on representations in documents \namici cannot review. See, e.g., Pet. 12-13. Because amici \ndo not have access to these materials, amici are unable to \ntake  a  definitive  position  on  this  issue.  But  it  is  abun-\ndantly  clear  that  the  federal  government  intended  to \nseek this Court’s review in an expeditious matter within \n24  hours  of  the  court  of  appeals’  en  banc  decision.  See \nPet.  9,  11.  At  a  minimum,  these  extraordinary  circum-\nstances further warrant vacatur.",
        "26 \n\nC O N C L U S IO N \n\nThe petition for a writ of certiorari should be granted, \nthe judgment of the court of appeals should be vacated, \nand the case should be remanded to the court of appeals \nwith instructions to remand to the district court for dis-\nmissal of all claims for prospective relief regarding preg-\nnant unaccompanied minors.  \n\nDECEMBER 2017 \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\nLESLIE RUTLEDGE \nAttorney General of \n   Arkansas \n\nM.

Bevin.1  The  States  have  an  interest  in \ncooperating with the federal  government to establish a \nconsistent  and  correct  understanding  of  the  rights  of \naliens  unlawfully  present  in  the  United  States,  as  the \nStates  “bear[]  many  of  the  consequences  of  unlawful \nimmigration.”  Arizona  v.  United  States,  567  U.S.  387, \n397  (2012).  The  States  also  have  “a  legitimate  and \nsubstantial  interest  in  preserving  and  promoting  fetal \nlife,”  as  well  as  an  “interest  in  promoting  respect  for \nhuman  life  at  all  stages  in  the  pregnancy.” Gonzales  v. \nCarhart, 550 U.S. 124, 145, 163 (2007). \n\nsustained—a \n\ncourt  of  appeals \n\nIn  this  case,  the  district  court  entered—and  the  en \ntemporary \nbanc \nrestraining  order  effectively  declaring  that  the  U.S. \nConstitution  confers  on  unlawfully-present  aliens  the \nright  to  an  elective  abortion  that  is  not  medically \nnecessary—even when they have no ties to this country \nother  than  the  fact  of  their  arrest  while  attempting  to \ncross  the  border  unlawfully.

Under  the  reasoning  of \nthe courts below, there will be no meaningful limit on the \nconstitutional  rights  an  unlawfully-present  alien  can \ninvoke simply by attempting to enter this country. This \nrelief  also  contradicts \nlongstanding \nprecedent that full Fifth Amendment rights accorded to \ncitizens can only be extended to those aliens who “have \ncome  within  the  territory  of  the  United  States  and \ndeveloped  substantial  connections  with  this  country.” \nUnited  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez,  494  U.S.  259,  271 \n(1990) (emphasis added). \n\nthe  Court’s \n\nAmici  thus  urge  the  Court  to  vacate  the  court  of \n\nappeals’ judgment.  \n\n \n \n\f3 \n\nS U M M A R Y   O F   A R G U M E N T \n\nThe  decisions  below  are  unprecedented.  Until  now, \nno  court  had  ever  declared  that  the  Constitution  gives \nunlawfully-present  aliens  with  virtually  no  ties  to  this \ncountry  the  full  scope  of  affirmative  liberty  rights  ac-\ncorded  to  citizens.  The  district  court  and  the  en  banc \ncourt of appeals thus broke new ground by holding that \nan unlawfully-present alien with virtually no ties to this \ncountry has a constitutional right to an elective abortion. \nThis Court should vacate the court of appeals’ order \nbecause the Constitution does not confer the right to an \nelective abortion on unlawfully-present aliens with virtu-\nally no ties to the country, as Judge Henderson’s dissent \nbelow  rightly  concluded.  Under  long-settled  doctrine, \nthe constitutional rights an alien may invoke depend on \nthe scope of the alien’s ties to this country. It is true that \nall  persons—regardless  of  immigration  status,  and  re-\ngardless of their ties here—have certain cabined consti-\ntutional rights, including baseline procedural protections \nand the right to be free from gross physical abuse. But \nthat  does  not  mean  that  such  unlawfully-present  aliens \nare  accorded  the  panoply  of  affirmative  liberty  rights \nthat citizens and lawfully-present aliens possess.  \n\nThe  States—and  the  State  of  Texas  in  particular—\nare  already  spending  enormous  resources  dealing  with \nunlawful  immigration.  The  court  of  appeals’  decision, \nthough, creates a perverse incentive to unlawfully enter \nthe country. This will further add to the substantial bur-\nden faced by the governmental entities trying to prevent \nand deal with unlawful immigration. \n\n \n \n\f4 \n\nA R G U M E N T \n\nI.  Unlawfully-Present Aliens with Virtually No Con-\nnections  to  the  United  States  Have  No  Constitu-\ntional Right To An Elective Abortion. \n\nThe Court should vacate the decision below because \nthe right asserted does not exist: Unlawfully-present al-\niens with virtually no connections to the country do not \nhave  a  constitutional  right  to  an  elective  abortion.  The \ndistrict court necessarily erred in entering—and the en \nbanc court of appeals erred in upholding—the temporary \nrestraining  order.  See  Winter  v.  NRDC,  555  U.S.  7,  20 \n(2008)  (preliminary  injunctive  relief  unavailable  if  the \nplaintiff  cannot  establish  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the \nmerits); Mazurek v. Armstrong, 520 U.S. 968, 970 (1997) \n(per curiam) (same). \n\n  The  Decisions  Below  Overrode  This  Court’s \nLong-Settled  “Substantial  Connections”  Test, \nWhich  Provides  That  the  Degree  of  Connec-\ntions to This Country Determines the Degree of \nFifth Amendment Rights Accorded to Aliens. \n\nThe  “initial  inquiry”  in  assessing  any  due  process \nclaim is whether the Constitution protects the right the \nplaintiff  asserts.  See,  e.g.,  Meachum  v.  Fano,  427  U.S. \n215, 223-24 (1976). Only after confirming that the right \nat issue exists should a court move on to whether the gov-\nernment has violated that right. See id. The courts below \nthus should have begun their analysis by asking whether \nthe right to an elective abortion recognized by this Court \napplies  to  unlawfully-present  aliens  with  virtually  no \nconnections to this country who were apprehended while \nattempting to cross the border.  \n\n \n \n\f5 \n\nThe  answer  to  that  question,  as  Judge  Henderson \ncorrectly  concluded,  is  “plainly—and  easily—no.”  Pet. \nApp. 35a. \n\n1.  The Constitutional Rights of Aliens are De-\ntermined  by  a  Sliding  Scale  Based  on  the \nDegree of Connections the Alien Has to the \nCountry.  \n\n The  Fifth  Amendment  provides  that  “[n]o  person \nshall be . . . deprived of life, liberty, or property, without \ndue process of law.” This Court has held that unlawfully-\npresent  aliens  are  “persons”  protected  by  the  Fifth \nAmendment. Plyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 210 (1982). The \nCourt  reiterated  in  2001  that  “once  an  alien  enters  the \ncountry,  the  legal  circumstance  changes,  for  the  Due \nProcess Clause applies to all ‘persons’ within the United \nStates, including aliens, whether their presence here is \nlawful, unlawful, temporary, or permanent.” Zadvydas v. \nDavis, 533 U.S. 678, 693 (2001).2 \n\nBut  simply  because  an  individual  is  a  “person”  cov-\nered by the Fifth Amendment, it does not follow that the \nalien  is  necessarily  “due”  the  same  scope  of  rights  ac-\ncorded to citizens or lawfully-present aliens. This Court \nhas held that the rights an alien is “due” depend on the \nconnections that person has established with this coun-\ntry:  United  States  v.  Verdugo-Urquidez,  494  U.S.  259, \n270 (1990), clarified that Plyler’s Fifth Amendment anal-\nysis “establish[es] only that aliens receive constitutional \nprotections when they have come within the territory of \n\n2 Contrary to the statements in the panel dissent below, amici did \nnot argue that unlawfully-present aliens are not “persons.” Cf. Pet. \nApp. 16a.  \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f6 \n\nthe  United  States  and  developed  substantial  connec-\ntions with this country.” Id. at 271 (emphasis added).  \n\nVerdugo-Urquidez  emerged  from  this  Court’s  bed-\nrock rule that an alien is “accorded a generous and as-\ncending scale of rights as he increases his identity with \nour society.” Johnson v. Eisentrager, 339 U.S. 763, 770 \n(1950) (emphasis added). In other words, as set out first \nin Eisentrager and explained by Verdugo-Urquidez, an \nalien’s connections determine the scope of rights the al-\nien is due. See id. As a person develops increasing con-\nnections  with  this  country,  the  person’s  constitutional \nprotections expand. E.g., Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at \n268-69; see also Trump v. Int’l Refugee Assistance Pro-\nject, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (per curiam) (staying in-\njunction  of  immigration  order  for  aliens  “who  lack  any \nbona  fide  relationship  with  a  person  or  entity  in  the \nUnited  States”).  Initial  lawful  entry  affords  “safe  con-\nduct” and confers “certain rights,” which “become more \nextensive and secure when he makes preliminary decla-\nration of intention to become a citizen, and they expand \nto those of full citizenship upon naturalization.” Eisten-\ntrager, 339 U.S. at 770; see Landon v. Plasencia, 459 U.S. \n21, 32 (1982) (alien’s “constitutional status changes” only \nafter  he  “gains  admission  to  our  country  and  begins  to \ndevelop the ties that go with permanent residence”).  \n\nNo decision of this Court or any other court has ab-\nrogated \nthat  basic  Eisentrager/Verdugo-Urquidez \nframework  of  a  sliding  scale  of  rights  based  on  the  de-\ngree of connections the alien has to the country. In par-\nticular,  Zadvydas  did  not  alter  or  undermine  Verdugo-\nUrquidez’s pronouncement that to invoke the full scope \nof Fifth Amendment rights, an unlawfully-present alien \n\n \n \n\f7 \n\nmust  demonstrate  “substantial  connections.”  See,  e.g., \nIbrahim  v.  Dep’t  of  Homeland  Sec.,  669  F.3d  983,  997 \n(9th  Cir.  2012)  (applying  “significant  voluntary  connec-\ntion”  test  from  Verdugo-Urquidez);  United  States  v. \nMeza-Rodriguez, 798 F.3d 664, 670 (7th Cir. 2015), cert. \ndenied, 136 S. Ct. 1655 (2016) (same). In fact, Zadvydas \nexpressly limited its analysis to “aliens who were admit-\nted  to  the  United  States  but  subsequently  ordered  re-\nmoved.” 533 U.S. at 682 (emphasis added). By contrast, \n“[a]liens who have not yet gained initial admission to this \ncountry would present a very different question.” Id. \n\n2.  Unlawfully-Present  Aliens  With  Virtually \nNo  Connections  to  the  Country  Lack  the \nPanoply  of  Affirmatively  Liberty  Rights \nthat  Citizens  and  Lawfully-Present  Aliens \nPossess,  Although  They  Do  Have  Baseline \nProcedural Protections and the Right to be \nFree from Gross Physical Abuse. \n\na.  The sliding-scale approach set out in Eisentrager \nand Verdugo-Urquidez recognizes that it is the rare ex-\nception where constitutional rights  are  accorded  to  un-\nlawfully-present aliens with minimal connections to the \ncountry.  Under  that  rare  exception,  the  mere  fact  of \npresence in this country—even unlawful presence—does \nconfer  certain  baseline  constitutional  rights  against \negregious harm, but not affirmative liberty rights. And \neven  when  certain  limited  constitutional  rights  are  ex-\ntended  to  unlawfully-present  aliens,  courts  routinely \nhold  that  the  full  scope  of  a  constitutional  provisions’ \nrights do not extend to such aliens.  \n\n \n \n\f8 \n\nFor example, mere unlawful presence confers a basic \nright against “gross physical abuse” in this country. Cas-\ntro v. Cabrera, 742 F.3d 595, 600 (5th Cir. 2014) (citing \nLynch  v.  Cannatella,  810  F.2d  1363,  1370  (5th  Cir. \n1987)). The Constitution protects everyone on U.S. soil, \neven unlawfully-present aliens with no other ties to this \ncountry,  against  the  “wanton  or  malicious  infliction  of \npain” by governmental officials. Id. \n\nThe panel dissent—which the en banc majority below \n“substantially”  adopted,  Pet.  App.  19a—argued  that \namici’s position would mean that the alien here and “eve-\nryone  else  here  without  lawful  documentation—includ-\ning  everyone  under  supervision  pending  immigration \nproceedings  and  all  Dreamers—have  no  constitutional \nright to bodily integrity in any form (absent criminal con-\nviction).”  Pet.  App.  16a.  But  that  does  not  follow  from \namici’s position, and this Court’s precedents do not lead \nto  that  drastic  outcome.  The  “deeply  troubling”  hypo-\ntheticals the panel dissent posited are thus fully resolved \nby a proper application of the Eisentrager/Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez framework. Cf. Pet. App. 16a. \n\nUnder the “ascending scale” of rights articulated in \nJohnson  (339  U.S.  at  770),  reinforced  in  Landon  (459 \nU.S.  at  32),  restated  in  Verdugo-Urquidez  (494  U.S.  at \n268-69)—and  applied  in  Lynch  (810  F.2d  at  1370)  and \nCastro  (742  F.  3d  at  600)—all  persons  on  U.S.  soil  are \nconstitutionally  protected  against  “gross  physical \nabuse.” Castro, 742 F.3d at 600. However, even though \nthe  Constitution  confers  basic  protection  against  gross \nphysical abuse, full Fourth Amendment rights accorded \nto citizens do not apply to unlawfully-present aliens with \n\n \n \n\f9 \n\nonly minimal connections to the country. See, e.g., Cas-\ntro,  742  F.3d  at  599-600  (Fourth  Amendment  does  not \nextend  to  unlawfully-present  aliens  who  remain  in  the \nUnited States illegally, unless they are raising claims of \n“gross physical abuse”); United States v. Vilches-Navar-\nrete,  523  F.3d  1,  13  (1st  Cir.  2008)  (criminal  defendant \nlacked  “substantial  connection”  with  U.S.  necessary  to \ninvoke  Fourth  Amendment  protection  under  Verdugo-\nUrquidez). \n\nIn  addition  to  the  gross-physical-abuse  prohibition, \nthe mere fact of presence in this country—even unlawful \npresence—also confers a certain set of basic procedural \nguarantees  before  the  federal  government  can  deport \nthe individual. See, e.g., Demore v. Kim, 538 U.S. 510, 523 \n(2003) (it is “well established” that aliens have due-pro-\ncess rights in deportation hearings). But even then, the \nfull scope of procedural due process rights guaranteed to \ncitizens  does  not  extend  to  unlawfully-present  aliens. \nSee, e.g., id. at 521 (“‘In the exercise of its broad power \nover naturalization and immigration, Congress regularly \nmakes rules that would be unacceptable if applied to cit-\nizens.’”  (quoting  Mathews  v.  Diaz,  426  U.S.  67,  79-80 \n(1976)));  accord,  e.g.,  Zadvydas,  533  U.S.  at  718  (Ken-\nnedy, J., dissenting) (“The liberty rights of the aliens be-\nfore us here are subject to limitations and conditions not \napplicable  to  citizens,  however.”  (citing  Mathews,  426 \nU.S. at 79-80)). \n\nIn sum, the fact that basic procedural safeguards and \nprotections against “gross physical abuse” are afforded \nto everyone on U.S. soil does not mean that the full pan-\noply of constitutional rights accorded to citizens extends \n\n \n \n\f10 \n\nto each unlawfully-present alien with only minimal con-\nnections to the country. See Verdugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. \nat 268-69. \n\nb.    Furthermore,  courts  routinely  hold  that  unlaw-\nfully-present  aliens  with  minimal  connections  to  the \ncountry lack affirmative liberty rights.  \n\nFor example, numerous courts have held that unlaw-\nfully-present  aliens  with  minimal  connections  to  the \ncountry do not have the Second Amendment “fundamen-\ntal  right”  (McDonald  v.  City  of  Chicago,  561  U.S.  742, \n778 (2010)) to keep and bear arms. United States v. Por-\ntillo–Munoz, 643 F.3d 437, 442 (5th Cir. 2011) as revised \n(June 29, 2011); United States v. Carpio–Leon, 701 F.3d \n974, 979 (4th Cir. 2012); United States v. Flores, 663 F.3d \n1022, 1023 (8th Cir. 2011) (per curiam); cf. Meza-Rodri-\nguez, 798 F.3d at 669-672 (unlawfully-present alien had \nSecond Amendment rights only because he arrived in the \nU.S. at a young age and lived here for 20 years). \n\nAnd full First Amendment rights do not extend to un-\nlawfully-present  aliens  without  substantial  connections \nto the country. See, e.g., Citizens United v. FEC, 558 U.S. \n310, 362 (2010) (noting federal statute, now codified at 52 \nU.S.C.  §30121,  prohibiting  “foreign  national[s]”  from \nmaking  direct  contributions  or  independent  expendi-\ntures  for  political  speech);  Kleindienst  v.  Mandel,  408 \nU.S. 753, 769-70 (1972) (alien may be returned to home \ncountry for engaging in disfavored political speech in this \ncountry); Galvan v. Press, 347 U.S. 522, 531 (1954) (gov-\nernment may restrict alien’s freedom of association).  \n\nThe  Department  of  Justice  has  explicitly  advanced \nthis view in previous litigation. See Federal Defendants’ \nMemorandum  in  Opposition  to  Plaintiffs’  Motion  for \n\n \n \n\f11 \n\nTRO at 13, Pineda-Cruz v. Thompson, No. 5:15-cv-00326 \n(W.D.  Tex.  May  7,  2015)  (Dkt.  22)  (“Because  Plaintiffs \nnever gained entry into the United States and have not \ndeveloped  substantial  connections  with  this  country, \nthey are not within the scope of individuals contemplated \nby the Supreme Court as being able to raise claims under \nthe First Amendment.”). In fact, the federal government \nhas, on dozens of occasions, argued that unlawfully-pre-\nsent aliens lack the full scope of constitutional rights af-\nforded to citizens. See infra Part II.B.2. \n\nThese principles establishing that unlawfully-present \naliens  lack  affirmative  liberty  rights  held  by  citizens \ncomport with this Court’s declaration that aliens subject \nto  deportation  may  be  detained  as  their  deportation  is \nprocessed. See, e.g., Kim, 538 U.S. at 523 (“At the same \ntime, however, this Court has recognized detention dur-\ning  deportation  proceedings  as  a  constitutionally  valid \naspect  of  the  deportation  process.”).  With  physical  de-\ntention necessarily comes a restriction of liberties. \n\nc.  The affirmative substantive due process right rec-\nognized by the Court to seek the medical procedure of an \nelective abortion is much more analogous to the affirma-\ntive liberty rights courts have repeatedly held are not ac-\ncorded to unlawfully-present aliens who lack substantial \nconnections to the country. In contrast, baseline proce-\ndural safeguards and the basic protection against gross \nphysical abuse are negative prohibitions on drastic gov-\nernment  conduct  (detention  and  removal  without  any \nprocess, and gross physical abuse). \n\nRespondent  has  never  offered  any  authority  to  the \ncontrary. In the proceedings below, respondent argued \nthat the alien’s immigration status has no impact at all \n\n \n \n\f12 \n\non  the  constitutional  rights  she  may  assert.  That  is \nwrong, as the authorities above confirm. Moreover, the \nauthorities respondent relied on below do not establish \nthe right to an elective abortion. \n\nRespondent relied on various abortion cases, includ-\ning  Planned  Parenthood  of  Se.  Pa.  v.  Casey,  505  U.S. \n833,  871  (1992)  (plurality  op.),  for  the  proposition  that \n“the government may not prohibit any woman from mak-\ning the ultimate decision to terminate her pregnancy be-\nfore  viability.”  Plaintiff’s  Memorandum  in  Support  of \nHer Application for a Temporary Restraining Order and \nMotion  for  Preliminary  Injunction,  Garza  v.  Hargan, \nNo. 1:17-cv-02122 (D.D.C. Oct. 14, 2017) Dkt. 3-2 at 9-10 \n(citing  Casey,  505  U.S.  at  871  (plurality  op.);  Whole \nWoman’s  Health  v.  Hellerstedt,  136  S.  Ct.  2292  (2016); \nPlanned Parenthood of Cent. Missouri v. Danforth, 428 \nU.S. 52, 74 (1976), and Bellotti v. Baird, 443 U.S. 622, 633 \nn.12 (1979)). But not one of respondent’s cited cases says \nor implies that the substantive due process right to abor-\ntion recognized by this Court extends to unlawfully-pre-\nsent aliens—especially not those who have no ties to this \ncountry.  \n\nRespondent further offered a string citation of cases, \nbut none of those cases support the proposition that un-\nlawfully-present aliens have the right to an elective abor-\ntion. R.I.L-R v. Johnson, 80 F. Supp. 3d 164, 187 (D.D.C. \n2015), for example, concerned whether the government \ncould continue to detain asylum applicants after those in-\ndividuals  had  demonstrated  a  credible  fear  of  persecu-\ntion. Each of the applicants had family members in the \nUnited  States  who  had  agreed  to  provide  shelter  and \nsupport  for  the  asylum-seekers.  On  those  facts,  and  in \n\n \n \n\f13 \n\nlight of the plaintiffs’ threshold showing of asylum eligi-\nbility, the district court held that they could invoke the \nprotection of the Due Process Clause. Here, the opera-\ntive complaint says nothing about asylum, alleges no con-\nnection to the U.S. at all, and offers no basis to believe \nthat the alien is on track to permanent residence.  \n\nRespondent’s  other  authorities  fare  no  better.  Re-\nspondent claimed the alleged abortion right was derived \nfrom Plyler, 457 U.S. at 210. But as explained above, this \nCourt  explicitly  clarified  and  supplanted  Plyler  in  Ver-\ndugo-Urquidez, 494 U.S. at 270-71. So too with Mathews, \n426 U.S. at 77, which concerned resident aliens who were \nlawfully  admitted  to  the  United  States;  plus,  Mathews \ntoo was clarified and supplanted by Verdugo-Urquidez. \nAnd Kwai Fun Wong v. United States, 373 F.3d 952, 971 \n(9th Cir. 2004), concerned an alien who had been lawfully \npresent  in  the  U.S.  for  almost  two  decades—in  other \nwords,  someone  who  had  established  “substantial  con-\nnections” under Verdugo-Urquidez. \n\nIn short, none of respondent’s cited authorities sup-\nport  the  extraordinary  constitutional  holding  in  the \ncourts below.  \n\n  The  Operative  Complaint  Confirmed  that  the \nAlien At Issue Here Had No “Substantial Con-\nnections”  to  This  Country,  and  Therefore  Had \nNo Right to an Elective Abortion. \n\nThe operative Complaint (Dist. Ct. Dkt. 1) confirmed \nthat  that  alien  here  had  no  other  connection  to  the \nUnited States: \n\n \n \n\f14 \n\n  Paragraphs 4 and 5 summarized the aliens’ situa-\ntion but offered no allegations establishing a con-\nnection to the United States other than her unlaw-\nful presence. \n\n  Paragraph 13 alleged: “J.D. was detained by the \nfederal  government  and  placed  in  a  federally \nfunded  shelter  in  Texas.  J.D.  is  years  [sic]  old, \npregnant, and told the staff at the shelter where \nshe is currently housed that she wanted an abor-\ntion.” This paragraph admitted that the alien en-\ntered the United States unlawfully but offered no \nallegations  establishing  a  connection  to  the \nUnited States. \n\n  Paragraphs 14 and 15 discussed the alien’s efforts \nto obtain an abortion during her time in custody. \n  Paragraphs 33, 34, 35, 36, and 43 alleged that the \ndefendants restricted the alien’s ability to receive \nan abortion in the United States. \n\nThe alien even admitted below that that she has “no \nlegal immigration status.” Declaration, Dist. Ct. Dkt. 3-2 \nat 3. And the declaration that the alien submitted in sup-\nport of her motion for a temporary restraining order con-\nfirmed no substantial ties to this country: The alien ex-\nplicitly admitted she was “detained upon arrival.” Dist. \nCt. Dkt. 3-3 ¶ 4.  \n\nThose undisputed facts should have resolved this case \n“plainly”  and  “easily,”  as  Judge  Henderson  recognized \nbelow. Pet. App. 35a. Under Verdugo-Urquidez, the alien \nmust show “substantial connections” to assert full Fifth \nAmendment  affirmative  liberty  rights.  494  U.S.  at  271. \nShe did not do so. See Dist. Ct. Dkt. 1. She thus stands at \n\n \n \n\f15 \n\nthe start of the “ascending scale of rights” that individu-\nals climb as they “increase[] [their] identity with our so-\nciety.”  Eisentrager,  339  U.S.  at  770.  At  that  level,  the \nConstitution protects her against “gross physical abuse” \nin this country. Castro, 742 F. 3d at 600. The Constitution \nfurther  confers  some  basic  procedural  guarantees  re-\nlated  to  her  deportation  proceedings.  Kim,  538  U.S.  at \n523.  But  as  Verdugo-Urquidez,  Eisentrager,  and  Kim \nconfirm, it does not accord the affirmative liberty right \nto an elective abortion.  \n\nII.  The  Court  of  Appeals  Did  Not  Even  Cite  This \nCourt’s “Substantial Connections” Test, Which Is \nWell Accepted.  \n\nThe  court  below  entirely  overlooked  the  bedrock \nprinciples  articulated  in  Eisentrager  and  Verdugo-Ur-\nquidez, even though those principles confirm that an un-\nlawfully-present alien with virtually no ties to this coun-\ntry has no right to an elective abortion. That “initial in-\nquiry,” Meachum, 427 U.S. at 223-24, appears nowhere \nin any decision below. The fact that the court of appeals \nnot only reached the wrong result, but also applied the \nfundamentally wrong framework, is further grounds to \nvacate its judgment. See United States v. Munsingwear, \n340 U.S. 36, 40-41 (1950).3 \n\n3 Amici fully briefed this Verdugo-Urquidez framework to the \ncourts below. See Br. for Texas et al., Garza v. Hargan, No. 1:17-\ncv-02122-TSC (D.D.C.) (Oct. 17, 2017); Br. for Texas et al., Garza \nv. Hargan, No. 17-5236 (D.C. Cir.) (Oct. 19, 2017). \n\n \n \n                                            \n \n\f16 \n\n  The Courts Below Had a Duty to Apply the Cor-\n\nrect Law.  \n\nAs Judge Henderson’s dissent recognized, Pet. App. \n35a, 42a, regardless of what the parties have argued, the \ncourt of appeals should have decided the predicate con-\nstitutional  question  before  issuing  such  a  momentous \nholding. See,  e.g.,  U.S.  Nat’l  Bank  of  Or.  v.  Indep.  Ins. \nAgents of Am., Inc., 508 U.S. 439, 447 (1993) (if a party \n“fail[s] to identify and brief” “an issue ‘antecedent to . . . \nand ultimately dispositive of’ the dispute,” an appellate \ncourt  may  consider  the  issue  sua  sponte  (citation  omit-\nted)). After all, “even an explicit concession on this point \nwould not ‘“relieve this Court of the performance of the \njudicial  function”’  of  deciding  the  issues.”  Torres  v. \nPuerto Rico, 442 U.S. 465, 471 n.3 (1979) (quoting Sibron \nv. New York, 392 U.S. 40, 59 (1968)). Moreover, a govern-\nment’s “concessions cannot be accepted” when they are \ncontrary  to  law.  Massachusetts  v.  United  States,  333 \nU.S. 611, 625 (1948).  \n\nIn short, regardless of what the parties argued, the \ncourt  of  appeals  was  still  required  to  apply  the  correct \nlegal  framework.  See  id.  Because  the  court  of  appeals’ \nwholly incorrect framework is now law, it should be set \naside. \n\n  The  “Substantial  Connections”  Test  Is  Widely \nCited and Applied as Controlling. \n\n1.  The court of appeals’ failure here to address the \nVerdugo-Urquidez substantial-connections, sliding-scale \ntest is particularly striking given that other circuits uni-\nformly and routinely apply this controlling test when de-\ntermining  whether  aliens  can  assert  constitutional \n\n \n \n\f17 \n\nrights. E.g., Meza-Rodriguez, 798 F.3d at 670; Ibrahim, \n669  F.3d  at  995;  United  States  v.  Huitron-Guizar,  678 \nF.3d  1164,  1166  (10th  Cir.  2012);  Portillo-Munoz,  643 \nF.3d at 440; Vilches-Navarrete, 523 F.3d at 13; Atamir-\nzayeva v. United States, 524 F.3d 1320, 1325 (Fed. Cir. \n2008);  Nat’l  Council  of  Resistance  of  Iran  v.  Dep’t  of \nState, 251 F.3d 192, 202 (D.C. Cir. 2001).  \n\nAs these citations demonstrate, the arguments amici \nand  Judge  Henderson  advanced  simply  reflect  basic \nprinciples that have governed the rights of aliens for dec-\nades. \n\n2.  In conformance with the circuits’ widespread ad-\nherence  to  this  Court’s  established  precedent,  the  De-\npartment  of  Justice  has  relied  on  Verdugo-Urquidez’s \nsubstantial-connections  test  dozens  of  times  to  argue \nthat  unlawfully-present  aliens  without  sufficient  ties  to \nthe country lack constitutional rights.  \n\nJust  months  ago,  the  Department  argued  in  this \n\nCourt that:  \n\n[A]n alien arrested shortly after crossing the U.S. \nborder surreptitiously cannot lay the same claim \nto  constitutional  protections  as  aliens  who  were \nlawfully  admitted  or  who  entered  illegally  then \nbecame,  “in  a[]  real  sense,  a  part  of  our  popula-\ntion[.]”  \n\nBrief for the Respondents in Opposition, Castro v. Dep’t \nof  Homeland  Sec.,  137  S.  Ct.  1581  (2017)  (No.  16-812), \n2017 WL 1046315, at *17.  \n\nThat is not the only time this year that the Depart-\nment made that argument in this Court. See, e.g., Brief \nfor  the  United  States,  Hernandez  v.  Mesa,  137  S.  Ct. \n2003 (2017) (No. 15-118), 2017 WL 104588 at *35 (arguing \n\n \n \n\f18 \n\nthat, under Verdugo-Urquidez, aliens are “afforded con-\nstitutional protections only when ‘they ha[d] come within \nthe  territory  of  the  United  States  and  developed  sub-\nstantial  connections  with  this  country’”);  Transcript  of \nOral  Argument  at  17,  Jennings  v.  Rodriguez,  No.  15-\n1204 (U.S. October 3, 2017) (Q: “is your argument about \nthe new admits, the people who are coming to the border, \npremised on the idea that they simply have no constitu-\ntional rights at all?” A: “It is premised on that.”).4   \n\nThe Department has made similar arguments in the \nFifth Amendment context in other courts. E.g., Reply in \nSupport of Appellants’ Brief, Flores v. Sessions, 862 F.3d \n863 (9th Cir. 2017) (No. 17-55208), 2017 WL 1055525, at \n*13 n.6 (“Aliens identified at the border who have not had \nany contact with the United States—even if they are sub-\nsequently paroled into the territorial United States dur-\ning  the  resolution  of  their  applications  for  admission—\nare not entitled to any process other than that provided \nby statute.”); Brief for Appellee, United States v. Kole, \n164  F.3d  164  (3d  Cir.  1998)  (No.  96-5457),  1996  WL \n33453512, at *24 (“the Constitution was ‘not intended to \nextend to aliens in the same degree as to citizens’”); Brief \nfor  Respondent,  Wigglesworth  v.  I.N.S.,  319  F.3d  951 \n(7th Cir. 2003) (No. 02-1209), 2002 WL 32170294, at *19-\n*21 (“In order for the due process clause to apply, there \nmust be an identifiable life, liberty or property interest. \nIt is clear that any liberty interest [petitioner] may have \n\n4 The Department later modified its response to suggest that al-\niens might have some rights (which is also consistent with amici’s \nposition,  as  explained  above),  but  certainly  not  the  full  scope  af-\nforded citizens. Tr. at 17-18. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f19 \n\nin this regard is so weak that she clearly has no right to \na  hearing  before  an  immigration  judge…[petitioner]  is \nnot a permanent resident of the United States or even a \ntemporary resident.”).  \n\nAnd the Department has explicitly relied on the Ei-\nsentrager “ascending scale” analysis to argue against ex-\npanded due process rights for unlawfully-present aliens. \nE.g., Brief for Appellee United States, United States v. \nRaya-Vaca, 771 F.3d 1195 (9th Cir. 2014) (No. 13-50129), \n2013  WL  6221846,  at  *13–15  (“[T]here  has  long  been  a \nsliding-scale approach to determining the rights to be af-\nforded to aliens by the Due Process Clause. Under that \napproach, aliens generally enjoy more rights as a func-\ntion of their legality/longevity in this country. On one end \nof the scale is the undocumented alien; in the middle is \nthe lawful permanent resident; and at the opposite end is \nthe naturalized citizen. As an alien moves from one end \nof the scale to the other, his rights increase . . .”); Brief \nfor Defendant-Appellee Robert S. Mueller, Arar v. Ash-\ncroft, 532 F.3d 157 (2d Cir. 2008) (No. 06-4216-CV), 2007 \nWL 7285642 at * 32-33 (similar); Brief for Cross-Appel-\nlees  and  Reply  Brief  for  Appellants,  Gutierrez  v.

E.g.,  Federal  Defendants’ \nMemorandum in Opposition to Plaintiffs’ Motion \nfor  TRO  at  13,  Pineda-Cruz  v.  Thompson,  No. \n\n \n \n\f20 \n\n5:15-cv-00326  (W.D.  Tex.  May  7,  2015)  (Dkt.  22) \n(“Because  Plaintiffs  never  gained  entry  into  the \nUnited States and have not developed substantial \nconnections with this country, they are not within \nthe scope of individuals contemplated by the Su-\npreme Court as being able to raise claims under \nthe First Amendment.”). \n\n•  Second  Amendment.  E.g.,  Brief  for  the  United \nStates  as  Appellee,  United  States  v.  Torres,  No. \n15-10492  (9th  Cir.  July  15,  2016),  2016  WL \n3878372, at *22 (“unauthorized aliens do not have \na Second Amendment right to bear arms”); Brief \nand Short Appendix of Plaintiff-Appellee, United \nStates v. Meza-Rodriguez, 798 F.3d 664 (7th Cir. \n2015), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 1655 (2016) (No. 14-\n3271),  2015  WL  2064443,  at*13-*15  (“[T]he  gov-\nernment asserts that the term ‘the people’ within \nthe Second Amendment properly excludes illegal \naliens.”);  Brief  for  the  United  States,  United \nStates  v.

Rangel-Hernandez,  597  F.  App'x  553 \n(10th Cir. 2015) (No. 14-7056), 2015 WL 222869, at \n*8-*17  (arguing  that  an  unlawfully-present  alien \nhas no Second Amendment rights). \n\n•  Fourth Amendment. E.g., Appellee’s Brief, Cas-\ntro v. Cabrera, 742 F.3d 595 (5th Cir. 2014) (No. \n13-40017),  2013  WL  8635071,  at  *25  (“Plaintiffs \nwho were seeking admission as aliens were not en-\ntitled  to  constitutional  protections,  because  they \n\n \n \n\f21 \n\nhad  not  yet  ‘come  within  the  territory  of  the \nUnited States.’”). \n\n•  Sixth  Amendment.  E.g.,  Reply  Brief  for  Appel-\nlant United States at 9, United States v. Ospina, \n317  F.  App’x  684  (9th  Cir.  2009)  (No.  08-50461), \n2008  WL  6822006  (defendant’s  rights  “should \nhave  turned  on  objective  factors  and  practical \nconcerns, such as his citizenship, lack of substan-\ntial ties to the United States . . . . In [defendant]'s \ncase,  that  right  must  be  considered  diminished, \nrelative  to  the  speedy  trial  right  of  others  with \nmore substantial ties to the United States, living \nwithin  the  sovereign  or  diplomatic  reach  of  the \nUnited States.”). \n\nThese authorities confirm that the analyses set out in \nVerdugo-Urquidez  and  Eisentrager  not  only  are  axio-\nmatic, but that they are routinely applied in the exact sit-\nuation this case presents. The court of appeals’ failure to \neven recognize, let alone apply, the proper legal frame-\nwork  confirms  that  its  decision  should  be  vacated.  See \nMunsingwear, 340 U.S. at 40-41. \n\nIII.  If  Left  in  Place,  the  Decision  Below  Will \nExacerbate  Unlawful  Immigration  and  Further \nStrain the States’ Limited Resources. \n\nAs  this  Court  has  recognized,  the  States  already \n“bear[] many of the consequences of unlawful immigra-\ntion.”  Arizona,  567  U.S.  at  397.  In  short,  “[t]he  States \nlose badly needed tax dollars each year due to the pres-\nence of illegal aliens—a clear drain upon their already-\ntaxed resources.” Texas v. United States, 86 F. Supp. 3d \n591, 631 (S.D. Tex.), aff’d, 809 F.3d 134 (5th Cir. 2015), as \n\n \n \n\f22 \n\nrevised (Nov. 25, 2015), aff’d by an equally divided court, \n136 S. Ct. 2271 (2016) (per curiam). If allowed to stand, \nthe court of appeals’ decision will only exacerbate those \nlosses by inviting everyone who reaches this country un-\nlawfully—no  matter  how  briefly—to  demand  the  full \nscope of constitutional rights. \n\nThe  State  of  Texas,  in  particular,  already  expends \nsubstantial resources trying to deal with unlawful immi-\ngration.  Two  decades  ago,  the  Fifth  Circuit  recognized \nthat  Texas’  “educational,  medical,  and  criminal  justice \nexpenditures on undocumented aliens” were over a bil-\nlion  dollars  annually.  Texas  v.  United  States,  106  F.3d \n661,  664  (5th  Cir.  1997).  And  “in  2008,  Texas  incurred \n$716,800,000 in uncompensated medical care provided to \nillegal aliens.” Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d at 630.   \n\nThe State of Texas continues to incur these stagger-\ning costs caused by unlawful immigration. For example, \nduring  the  2013  fiscal  year  (the  most  recent  year  for \nwhich such data has been compiled) the State of Texas \nalone  spent  approximately  $90  million  on  emergency \nMedicaid  services  for  unlawfully-present  aliens.  See \nTexas Health and Human Services Commission, Report \non Texas Health and Human Services Commission Ser-\nvices  and  Benefits  Provided  to  Undocumented  Immi-\nhttps://hhs.texas.gov/re-\ngrants \nports/2015/02/report-health-and-human-services-com-\nmission-services-and-benefits-provided-undocumented-\nimmigrants. That was almost a $20 million increase over \nthe $71 million spent on such services in 2011, and almost \na  50%  increase  over  the  $62  million  spent  on  such  ser-\nvices  in  2009.  Id.  The  State  of  Texas  further  spent  ap-\nproximately  $38  million  during  the  2013  fiscal  year \n\n2014), \n\n(Dec. \n\n \n \n\f23 \n\nproviding coverage for perinatal care. That was millions \nmore  than  it  spent  in  2011  ($35  million)  and  2009  ($33 \nmillion). Id.  \n\nWhen more benefits are given to unlawfully-present \naliens,  it  will  incentivize  even  more  aliens  to  enter  the \ncountry unlawfully and “will increase the number of in-\ndividuals  that  demand  them.”  Texas,  86  F.  Supp.  3d  at \n634.  The  State’s  Health  and  Human  Services  Commis-\nsion has thus correctly projected the estimated sums will \ncontinue to rise as the number of unlawfully-present al-\niens increases within the State’s borders. See Plaintiff’s \nReply in Support of Motion for Preliminary Injunction at \n53,  Texas  v.  U.S.,  86  F. Supp. 3d  591  (S.D.  Tex.  2015) \n(No.  1:14-cv-00254).  Plus,  unlawfully-present  aliens  are \nless likely to have health insurance and are more likely \nto rely on emergency rooms or public clinics for health \ncare. Congressional Budget Office, The Impact of Unau-\nthorized Immigrants on the Budgets of State and Local \nGovernments (Dec. 2007), at 8, https://www.cbo.gov/pub-\nlication/41645.  \n\nThe rapid increase in unaccompanied minors such as \nthe  alien  here  accounts  for  much  of  those  cost  trends. \nFrom 2011 to 2014, the number of unaccompanied minors \napprehended  at  the  border  more  than  quadrupled—\nfrom 17,109 in 2011 to 73,741 in 2014. U.S. Government \nAccountability  Office,  Unaccompanied  Children:  HHS \nCan Take Further Actions to Monitor Their Care, GAO-\n16-180  (Feb.  2016),  at  4,  https://www.gao.gov/prod-\nucts/GAO-16-180.  Of  those  73,741,  nearly  57,500  were \nturned over to the care of the Office of Refugee Resettle-\nment. Id. at 1. This rapid increase “has at times strained \n\n \n \n\f24 \n\nORR’s capacity to find shelter beds,” id. at 2, and “cre-\nated challenges for the communities in which these chil-\ndren  are  eventually  placed.”  Id.  Furthermore,  the  in-\ncrease in facilities combined with insufficient resources \nhave prevented ORR from performing required on-site \nmonitoring of facilities, in some cases for several years. \nId. at 26-27. \n\nLarge influxes of unaccompanied minors also strain \nStates’ education resources. The State of Texas bears the \ncost of about $9,473 per child for the public education of \nunlawfully-present alien children. Texas, 86 F. Supp. 3d \nat  630.  From  October  2013  to  September  2014,  “Texas \nabsorbed  additional  education  costs  of  at \nleast \n$58,531,100 stemming from illegal immigration.” Id.  \n\nThe  costs  are  not  just  financial.  This  Court  in  Ari-\nzona  recognized  the  “disproportionate  share  of  serious \ncrime”  committed  by  unlawfully-present  aliens  in  Ari-\nzona’s  most  populous  county.  567  U.S.  at  398.  Indeed, \n“there  is  an  ‘epidemic  of  crime,  safety  risks,  serious \nproperty  damage,  and  environmental  problems’  associ-\nated  with  the  influx  of  illegal  migration  across  private \nland near the Mexican border.” Id. (citation omitted). \n\nStates like amici “cannot protect themselves from the \ncosts inflicted” by a massive uptick in the number of in-\ndividuals  able  “to  compel  state  action.”  Texas,  86  F. \nSupp. 3d at 620. That is why the States have consistently \nfought against any effort to “explicitly or impli[citly] so-\nlicit immigrants to enter the United States illegally.” Id. \nat 630.  \n\nYet the decision below does exactly that. The court of \nappeals’  decision  effectively  announces  that  anyone  on \nEarth has any number of constitutional rights simply by \n\n \n \n\f25 \n\nbeing  apprehended  while  trying  to  cross  the  United \nStates border unlawfully. This holding will make the un-\nlawful  immigration  crisis  worse  and  further  strain  the \nbudgets  and  resources  of  governments  throughout  the \nNation. \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nThe federal government has suggested that respond-\nent  counsel’s  efforts  to  thwart  this  Court’s  review  may \nwarrant disciplinary action. Pet. 26-28. The propriety of \nsuch action could turn on representations in documents \namici cannot review. See, e.g., Pet. 12-13. Because amici \ndo not have access to these materials, amici are unable to \ntake  a  definitive  position  on  this  issue.  But  it  is  abun-\ndantly  clear  that  the  federal  government  intended  to \nseek this Court’s review in an expeditious matter within \n24  hours  of  the  court  of  appeals’  en  banc  decision.  See \nPet.  9,  11.
