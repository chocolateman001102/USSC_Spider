Circuit \n\nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \n\n     Founded  in  1989,  amicus  curiae  Legal  Center  for \nDefense  of  Life  (“Legal  Center”)  is  a  nonprofit  New \nJersey \ndefending \nconstitutional rights of those who advocate on behalf \nof  unborn  children,  and  the  interests  of  the  unborn \nthemselves.  The Legal Center includes a network of \n\ncorporation \n\ndedicated \n\nto \n\n1  Amicus  files  this  brief  after  providing  the  requisite  ten  days’ \nprior  written  notice  and  receiving  written  consent  by  all  the \nparties.    Pursuant  to  Rule  37.6,  counsel  for  amicus  curiae \nauthored this brief in whole, no counsel for a party authored this \nbrief  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  no  person  or  entity –  other  than \namicus, its members, and its counsel – contributed monetarily to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief.",
        "2 \n\nattorneys who together have volunteered thousands of \nhours  of  pro  bono  services  in  defense  of  pro-life \nadvocates.     \n\nThe Legal Center has a direct and vital interest in \nopposing the creation of a new constitutional right to \nabortion by illegal aliens, and in defending the orderly \nadministration of justice when this issue is in dispute, \nas in this case. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nIllegal aliens do not have a constitutional right to \nenter  the  United  States  to  have  an  abortion,  or  to \nobtain  an  abortion  while  remaining  here  illegally.  \nMoreover,  no  one  has  a  right  to  compel  the  federal \ngovernment to be complicit in the procurement of an \nabortion.  The terse en banc judgment below is in error \non  both  fundamental  principles  of  law.    The  Petition \nshould  be  granted  to  vacate  the  judgment  or  correct \nthese significant errors of national importance. \n\nAt  a  minimum,  as  argued  by  the  United  States \nhere,  the  decision  below  should  be  vacated  as  moot.  \n(Pet. 20-24, relying on United States v. Munsingwear, \nInc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950), and similar authorities).  \nIn  addition,  this  Court  should  recognize  that  the \ndecision  below  was  a  radical  departure  from  the \ndecisions of this Court, which is an independent basis \nfor  granting certiorari.    Neither  the  Constitution  nor \neven  judge-made  law  supports what the D.C. Circuit \nen banc implicitly held below in compelling the federal \ngovernment to be complicit in an abortion by an illegal \nalien in Texas.  If not vacated or reversed, it is likely \nthere will be attempts to use the decision below as an \nimproper precedent nationwide.  The supervisory role",
        "3 \n\nof  this  Court  requires  reversal  of  these  substantial \nerrors before they propagate further. \n\nIn  addition,  this  Court  should  disapprove  with \ndiscipline the legal tactics used below in obtaining an \nabortion in the middle of the night – scheduled at 4:15 \na.m. (Pet. 11) – timed to thwart orderly review by this \nCourt.  That conduct increased the medical risks to the \n17-year-old girl J.D., and infringed on her right to fully \ninformed consent.  Such legally motivated tactics are \nbelow  the  standards  of  this  Court  and  the  legal \nprofession, and should be chastised accordingly. \n\nThe  Solicitor  General’s  Petition  for  a  Writ  of \nCertiorari  should  be  granted  because  the  decision \nbelow  cannot  stand,  and  the  legal  tactics  used  to \ndisrupt  the  orderly  administration  of  justice  should \nnot go unpunished.   \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI. \n\nTHE  DECISION  BELOW  ERRONEOUSLY \nDECIDED IMPORTANT FEDERAL QUESTIONS \nIN CONFLICT WITH RELEVANT DECISIONS OF \nTHIS COURT.  \n\nThis  Court  has  been  clear  that  the  federal \ngovernment  can  prefer  childbirth  over  abortion,  and \nthus  there  is  no  constitutional  right  for  anyone  to \ncompel  complicity  by  the  federal  government  in \nobtaining  an  abortion.    In  the  case  of  seeking  an \nabortion  for  an  illegal  alien  held  in  federal  custody, \nsuch  complicity  is  inherently  sought  by  the  attempt \nitself.  The decision below squarely conflicts with the \nfundamental  principle  of  abortion  jurisprudence  that",
        "4 \n\nthe  federal  government  can  side  completely  with \nchildbirth rather than abortion. \n\nMoreover, illegal aliens do not have a right to have \nan  abortion  in  the  United  States.    Yet  the  decision \nbelow implicitly and improperly invented such a new \nright where none exists. \n\nA.  The  Decision  Below  Erred  in  Compelling \nComplicity by the Federal Government in \nProcuring an Abortion. \n\n“[A]  State \n\nis  permitted  to  enact  persuasive \nmeasures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if \nthose  measures  do  not  further  a  health  interest.”  \nPlanned  Parenthood  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833,  886 \n(1992).    This  concept  is  central  to  the  longstanding \nprecedent that the federal government may fund the \ncosts  of  childbirth  while  refusing  to  fund  expenses \nrelating  to  abortion.    See  Harris  v.  McRae,  448  U.S. \n297, 325 (1980) (“Congress has [properly] established \nincentives  that  make  childbirth  a  more  attractive \nalternative than abortion.”). \n\nDespite  this,  a  concurring  opinion  below  stated \n\nthat: \n\nWhat is forcing J.D. to carry on this pregnancy is \nnot  J.D.’s  choice.  It  is  not  Texas  law.  It  is  the \nfederal government’s refusal to allow an abortion to \ngo  forward.  The  government’s  refusal  to  release \nJ.D. from custody is not just a substantial obstacle; \nit  is  a  full-on,  unqualified  denial  of  and  flat \nprohibition  on  J.D.’s  right  to  make  her  own \nreproductive choice. \n\n(Pet. App. 8a, Millett, J., concurring).   \n\nIn  fact  no  one,  and  certainly  not  the  federal \ngovernment, has been depriving J.D. of her full ability",
        "5 \n\nto  end  her  illegal  presence  in  this  country  by  simply \nreturning  home.    J.D.  entered  here  illegally  against \nthe will of the United States government and contrary \nto  applicable  law.    She  has  been  able  to  leave  this \ncountry at any time.  It would be as though someone \nhad  entered  a  religious  hospital  that  declines  to \nperform abortions and then refuses to leave until she \nobtains one at that hospital.  The Constitution does not \ncompel  a  religious  hospital  –  or  the  United  States \ngovernment – to be complicit in a sought-for abortion. \n\nB.  The Decision Below Erred in Assuming an \nIllegal Alien Has a Right to an Abortion. \nThe  United  States  is  not  a  sanctuary  for  all \nforeigners who want an elective abortion, particularly \nwhen the laws of their home country prohibit it, as in \nthis case.  Yet that is the basis of the ruling below, in \nassuming  that  a  foreigner  who  was  eight  weeks \npregnant when she illegally entered the United States \nsomehow has a constitutional right to obtain abortion \nhere.  J.D. is a trespasser on American soil, and has no \nlegitimate right to demand an abortion here. \n\nAn illegal alien has a status no greater than that of \na  trespasser  at  common  law,  who  may  be  properly \ndetained and restricted in movement, especially if the \ntrespasser  is  unwilling  to  leave.    A  landowner  who \nrestricts  the  movement  of  a  defiant  trespasser  is  not \nliable for false imprisonment.  See, e.g., Prinz v. Greate \nBay Casino Corp., 705 F.2d 692, 694 (3d Cir. 1983) (“If \nhe could not lawfully remain there was probable cause \nfor his detention as a defiant trespasser, which in New \nJersey \nfalse \nimprisonment.”).  \n\nis  a  defense \n\ncharge  of \n\nto  a \n\nMost  other  countries  of  the  world  properly  have \nlaws against abortion, in contrast with the framework",
        "6 \n\nof  unlimited  abortion  in  the  United  States  as \nestablished in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and \nDoe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973).  Elective abortion \nis illegal in the country from which J.D. came.  (Pet. \n37a)    Indeed,  elective  abortion  is  properly  illegal  in \nmuch  of  Central  and  South  America.    See,  e.g., \nJohanna  Zacarias,  Note:  “Suffering  in  Silence:  The \nUrgent  Need  to  Address  El  Salvador’s  Lack  of \nReproductive Rights,” 47 Geo. Wash. Int'l L. Rev. 233, \n239  (2015)  (“After  April  20,  1998,  all  abortions  - \nincluding those which were previously allowed - were \ncriminalized and [t]he abortion provisions were placed \nin a new section of the Penal Code that details offenses \nagainst the ‘human life in formation.’”). \n\nMiddle  Eastern  countries  likewise  have  laws \nagainst  abortion  that  are  stricter  than  in  the  United \nStates.   In Israel, for example, abortion is allowed only \nif  there  is  an  application  to  and  approval  by  a \nPregnancy  Termination  Committee,  and  “as  of  1993, \nlegal  access  to  abortion  had  been  narrowed  through \nstricter \nlimitations  on  the  discretion  of”  those \ncommittees to approve abortion.  Noya Rimalt, “When \nRights  Don’t  Talk:  Abortion  Law  and  the  Politics  of \nCompromise,”  28  Yale  J.L.  &  Feminism  327,  355 \n(2017).    Respect  for  abortion  laws  in  other  nations \nshould  benefit  from  the  same  level  of  international \ncomity  that  other  legal  issues  receive,  such  as  the \nmatter  of  personal  jurisdiction.    See  Daimler  AG  v. \nBauman,  134  S.  Ct.  746,  763  (2014)  (reversing  the \nNinth Circuit for having “paid little heed to the risks \nto  international  comity  its  expansive  view  of  general \njurisdiction posed”).",
        "7 \n\nIn  Plyler  v.  Doe,  a  5-4  Supreme  Court  ruled  that \nchildren of illegal aliens have a constitutional right to \nattend  public  schools  free  of  cost,  and  that  this  right \ncannot be denied by States.  But J.D. is an illegal alien \nherself,  and  the  rationale  in  Plyler  does  not  apply  to \nthe issue of whether an illegal alien herself has a right \nto an abortion: \n\nPersuasive arguments support the view that a \nState may withhold its beneficience from those \nwhose very presence within the United States \nis the product of their own unlawful conduct. \nThese arguments do not apply with the same force \nto classifications imposing disabilities on the minor \nchildren of such illegal entrants. At the least, those \nwho  elect  to  enter  our  territory  by  stealth  and  in \nviolation of our law should be prepared to bear the \nconsequences, \nlimited  to, \ndeportation.  \n\nincluding,  but  not \n\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 219-20 (1982) (emphasis in \noriginal).  Here illegally herself, J.D. has no right to a \nfree  public  education  under  the  Plyler  decision,  and \nshe has no constitutional right to an abortion in Texas. \n\nII. \n\nTHE  HURRIED,  MIDDLE-OF-THE-NIGHT \nABORTION  INCREASED  MEDICAL  RISK, \nUNDERMINED  INFORMED  CONSENT,  AND  IS \nORDERLY \nA \nTHE \nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. \n\nBLIGHT \n\nON \n\nThe  hurried,  middle-of-the-night2  abortion  put  a \n17-year-old  girl  at  heightened  medical  risk,  and \n\n2 The abortion was scheduled for 4:15 a.m.  (Pet. 11)",
        "8 \n\ndeprived  her  of  fully  informed  consent  for  the  life-\nchanging  procedure. \n  Even  many  who  support \nlegalized abortion would agree that the circumstances \nand timing of the abortion below are not a proper way \nto terminate a pregnancy or resolve an ongoing legal \ndispute about one.  What transpired in this case is a \nblight  on  the  orderly  administration  of  justice,  and \nmight  be  characterized  by  a  future  observer  as \nuncivilized. \n\nHad  a  State  hurriedly  executed  a  prisoner  in  the \nmiddle of the night to avert review by this Court, there \nis  little  doubt  that  this  Court  would  harshly  and \nunanimously condemn it.  Such chicanery is even less \nappropriate in the context of an abortion, where fully \ninformed  consent  by  the  patient,  without  any  time \npressures, is essential. \n\nA.  Risk  of  Medical  Harm  Was  Increased  by \n\nthe Middle-of-the-Night Abortion. \n\nElective  surgery \n\nis  more  dangerous  when \nconducted  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  for  obvious \nreasons.  Surgeons are more likely to be fatigued, and \nless support staff is typically available both to assist in \nthe  procedure  and  to  address  complications.    The \npatient herself may be more fatigued.  Whatever the \ncauses,  night  surgery  is  widely  known  to  carry  an \nincreased risk of medical harm to the patient.  See, e.g., \n“Night  Surgeries  Linked  to  Risks,”  Business  Daily \n(Oct.  17,  2017)  (study  of  15,000  surgeries  showed  a \nmassive  50%  increase  in  complications  when  done \nbetween the hours of 9pm and 7am).3 \n\n3  https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/night-surgeries-linked-\nto-risks/ar-AAtFk2q (viewed 11/26/17).",
        "9 \n\nResearch  shows  that  sleep  deprivation  is  as \nharmful to clinical performance as alcohol intoxication \nis,  and  experts  advise  against  performing  elective \nsurgery under such circumstances: \n\nSleep  deprivation  adversely  affects \nperformance \nperformance as severely as alcohol intoxication. \n\nclinical \npsychomotor \n\nimpairs \n\nand \n\nMichael  Nurok,  M.D.,  Ph.D.,  Charles  A.  Czeisler, \nPh.D.,  M.D.,  and  Lisa  Soleymani  Lehmann,  M.D., \nPh.D., \n“Sleep  Deprivation,  Elective  Surgical \nProcedures, and Informed Consent,” N. Engl. J. Med. \n2010; 363:2577-2579 (Dec. 30, 2010).4 \n\nThe  rushed,  middle-of-the-night  abortion  on  J.D. \nput  her  at  unjustified  medical  risk.    It  may  not  be \nknown  for  years  if  her  cervix  was  damaged  by  the \nprocedure, thereby causing her problems with future \npregnancies.    Complications  from  abortion  include \nboth  immediate  harm  and  long-term  effects.    In \naddition  she  may  be  scarred  psychologically  by  the \ninherently  frightening  timing  of  the  procedure.  \nPatients  to  be  seen  the  following  day  by  the  same \npractitioners  were  also  jeopardized,  given  that  the \nsleep deprivation is as deleterious as intoxication. \n\nFor legal advantage, a foreign 17-year-old girl was \nsubjected  to  increased  risk  to  her  health,  in  order  to \nideologically  motivated  precedent.  \nestablish  an \nRegardless  of  whether  J.D.  or  ensuing  patients \nsuffered  actual  harm,  an  attempt  at  legal  advantage \ndoes  not  justify  inflicting  greater  medical  risk  on  a \nminor. \n\n4  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1007901  (viewed \n11/23/17).",
        "10 \n\nB.  The Right to Revoke Consent Is Deprived \nby  a  Time-Pressured,  Middle-of-the-Night \nAbortion. \n\nA  woman’s  right  to  revoke  consent  remains \nessential until the abortion begins, and she has a right \nto have full clarity of thought until that life-changing \nmoment.  Even in the context of capital punishment, \nwhere  no  consent \nis  required,  this  Court  has \nprohibited  executions  where  there  are  doubts  about \nthe  lack  of  clarity  of  mind.    See,  e.g.,  Panetti  v. \nQuarterman,  551  U.S.  930,  934  (2007)  (overturning \ncapital  punishment  where  doubts  were  raised  about \nthe mental clarity of the subject, observing that “‘the \nEighth  Amendment  prohibits  a  State  from  carrying \nout a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane.’  \nThe  prohibition  applies  despite  a  prisoner’s  earlier \ncompetency  to  be  held  responsible  for  committing  a \ncrime  and  to  be  tried  for it.”)  (quoting  Ford  v. \nWainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 409-410 (1986)). \n\nHad J.D. confessed to a crime under circumstances \nsimilar  to  how  the  abortion  was  performed,  her \nconfession would likely be deemed non-consensual and \ninadmissible. The Ninth Circuit held as follows: \n\nCommencing the interrogation of a teenager after \nmidnight,  and  pressing  it  past  3:00  a.m.,  absent \nsome showing that delay would risk the destruction \nof evidence or other such harm, creates far too great \na  risk  that  a  false  confession  will  be  extracted, \nleading  to  the  unjust  conviction  of  an  innocent \nperson. \n\nTaylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992, 1013 (9th Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 543 U.S. 1038 (2004).",
        "11 \n\nJ.D. was merely 17 years old while in a land foreign \nto her, and one can only wonder what she was told to \nexplain why the abortion was being done in the middle \nof the night.  This Court held the following about an \ninterrogation  of  a  15-year-old  boy  in  “the  dead  of \nnight”: \n\nAge 15 is a tender and difficult age for a boy of any \nrace.  He  cannot  be  judged  by  the  more  exacting \nstandards  of  maturity.  That  which  would  leave  a \nman  cold  and  unimpressed  can  overawe  and \noverwhelm  a  lad  in  his  early  teens.  This  is  the \nperiod  of  great  instability  which  the  crisis  of \nlad, \nadolescence \nquestioned through the dead of night by relays of \npolice, is a ready victim of the inquisition. \n\nproduces.  A \n\n15-year-old \n\nHaley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 599 (1948). \n\nIt is plausible, even likely, that J.D. did not feel she \nhad much of a choice to decline the middle-of-the-night \nabortion,  or  to  request  more  time  to  reconsider \nwhether  to  have  it.    She  was  probably  told  it  was \nnecessary  to  have  it  done  immediately,  and  she  may \nhave felt she did not have a right to change her mind.  \nThat is not true consent, and that is inconsistent with \nthe  applicable  Texas  law  requiring  informed  consent \nafter  counseling.    See  Pet.  69a,  ¶  6  (referencing \napplication  of  Texas’s  “state-mandated  counseling” \nrequirement). \n\nC.  The  Abortion  Violated \nAdministration of Justice. \n\nthe  Orderly \n\nZealous \n\nrepresentation \n\nend  where \nunnecessary  risks  to  health  and  safety  begin, \nparticularly  for  a  minor  such  as  J.D.    Moreover,  the \norderly administration of justice depends on respect by \n\nshould",
        "12 \n\nofficers of the court – its licensed attorneys – for legal \nprocedure.  Deference to the orderly procedure of this \nCourt was lacking in the rushed abortion below. \n\nWere this a case of capital punishment rather than \nan  abortion  dispute,  there  is  little  doubt  that  this \nCourt would discipline any attorney who arranged for \na  surprise  execution  by  a  State  in  order  to  deny  this \nCourt  full  review  of  the  issue.    The  integrity  of  legal \nprocess  suffers  if  such  conduct  goes  unaddressed.  \nIndeed, it is difficult to see why such conduct would not \nbe repeated in future cases, if there is no sanction of it \nhere. \n\n“An  attorney  acts  not  only  as  a  client’s \nrepresentative, but also as an officer of the court, and \nhas a duty to serve both masters.”  Bus.

The  conduct  in  procuring  the  middle-of-the-\nnight abortion, as recounted by Petitioner (Pet. 10-17), \ndoes not comport with the obligations of an attorney to \nserve as an officer of the Court. \n\nIn both Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the plaintiffs \nopposed  or  regretted  positions  that  their  attorneys \ntook.  In Doe, the plaintiff Sandra Cano later testified \nbefore  the  United  States  Senate  Committee  on  the \nJudiciary that she never even sought an abortion: \n\nI only sought legal assistance to get a divorce from \nmy  husband  and  to  get  my  children  from  foster \ncare. I was very vulnerable: poor and pregnant with \nmy  fourth  child,  but  abortion  never  crossed  my \nmind.    Although  it  apparently  was  utmost  in  the \nmind of the attorney from whom I sought help. At \none point during the legal proceedings, it was \nnecessary for me to flee to Oklahoma to avoid",

Please  understand  even  though  I  have \nlived  what  many  would  consider  an  unstable  life \nand overcome many devastating circumstances, at \nNO TIME did I ever have an abortion. I did not seek \nan abortion nor do I believe in abortion. \n\nLinda L. Schlueter, “40th Anniversary of Roe v.

Wade, the plaintiff Norma \nMcCorvey  later  brought  a  lawsuit  in  an  attempt  to \nreverse the outcome that had supposedly been in her \nfavor.  While this Court declined to review her appeal, \nJudge  Edith  Jones  on  the  Fifth  Circuit  remarked  on \nhow  “the  Court  will  never  be  able  to  examine  its \nfactual  assumptions  on  a  record  made  in  court.”  \nMcCorvey  v.

Circuit \n\nINTEREST OF AMICUS CURIAE1 \n\n     Founded  in  1989,  amicus  curiae  Legal  Center  for \nDefense  of  Life  (“Legal  Center”)  is  a  nonprofit  New \nJersey \ndefending \nconstitutional rights of those who advocate on behalf \nof  unborn  children,  and  the  interests  of  the  unborn \nthemselves.  The Legal Center includes a network of \n\ncorporation \n\ndedicated \n\nto \n\n1  Amicus  files  this  brief  after  providing  the  requisite  ten  days’ \nprior  written  notice  and  receiving  written  consent  by  all  the \nparties.    Pursuant  to  Rule  37.6,  counsel  for  amicus  curiae \nauthored this brief in whole, no counsel for a party authored this \nbrief  in  whole  or  in  part,  and  no  person  or  entity –  other  than \namicus, its members, and its counsel – contributed monetarily to \nthe preparation or submission of this brief. \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n                                                 \n\f2 \n\nattorneys who together have volunteered thousands of \nhours  of  pro  bono  services  in  defense  of  pro-life \nadvocates.     \n\nThe Legal Center has a direct and vital interest in \nopposing the creation of a new constitutional right to \nabortion by illegal aliens, and in defending the orderly \nadministration of justice when this issue is in dispute, \nas in this case. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nIllegal aliens do not have a constitutional right to \nenter  the  United  States  to  have  an  abortion,  or  to \nobtain  an  abortion  while  remaining  here  illegally.  \nMoreover,  no  one  has  a  right  to  compel  the  federal \ngovernment to be complicit in the procurement of an \nabortion.  The terse en banc judgment below is in error \non  both  fundamental  principles  of  law.    The  Petition \nshould  be  granted  to  vacate  the  judgment  or  correct \nthese significant errors of national importance. \n\nAt  a  minimum,  as  argued  by  the  United  States \nhere,  the  decision  below  should  be  vacated  as  moot.  \n(Pet. 20-24, relying on United States v. Munsingwear, \nInc., 340 U.S. 36, 39 (1950), and similar authorities).  \nIn  addition,  this  Court  should  recognize  that  the \ndecision  below  was  a  radical  departure  from  the \ndecisions of this Court, which is an independent basis \nfor  granting certiorari.    Neither  the  Constitution  nor \neven  judge-made  law  supports what the D.C. Circuit \nen banc implicitly held below in compelling the federal \ngovernment to be complicit in an abortion by an illegal \nalien in Texas.  If not vacated or reversed, it is likely \nthere will be attempts to use the decision below as an \nimproper precedent nationwide.  The supervisory role \n\n \n\f3 \n\nof  this  Court  requires  reversal  of  these  substantial \nerrors before they propagate further. \n\nIn  addition,  this  Court  should  disapprove  with \ndiscipline the legal tactics used below in obtaining an \nabortion in the middle of the night – scheduled at 4:15 \na.m. (Pet. 11) – timed to thwart orderly review by this \nCourt.  That conduct increased the medical risks to the \n17-year-old girl J.D., and infringed on her right to fully \ninformed consent.  Such legally motivated tactics are \nbelow  the  standards  of  this  Court  and  the  legal \nprofession, and should be chastised accordingly. \n\nThe  Solicitor  General’s  Petition  for  a  Writ  of \nCertiorari  should  be  granted  because  the  decision \nbelow  cannot  stand,  and  the  legal  tactics  used  to \ndisrupt  the  orderly  administration  of  justice  should \nnot go unpunished.   \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI. \n\nTHE  DECISION  BELOW  ERRONEOUSLY \nDECIDED IMPORTANT FEDERAL QUESTIONS \nIN CONFLICT WITH RELEVANT DECISIONS OF \nTHIS COURT.  \n\nThis  Court  has  been  clear  that  the  federal \ngovernment  can  prefer  childbirth  over  abortion,  and \nthus  there  is  no  constitutional  right  for  anyone  to \ncompel  complicity  by  the  federal  government  in \nobtaining  an  abortion.    In  the  case  of  seeking  an \nabortion  for  an  illegal  alien  held  in  federal  custody, \nsuch  complicity  is  inherently  sought  by  the  attempt \nitself.  The decision below squarely conflicts with the \nfundamental  principle  of  abortion  jurisprudence  that \n\n\f4 \n\nthe  federal  government  can  side  completely  with \nchildbirth rather than abortion. \n\nMoreover, illegal aliens do not have a right to have \nan  abortion  in  the  United  States.    Yet  the  decision \nbelow implicitly and improperly invented such a new \nright where none exists. \n\nA.  The  Decision  Below  Erred  in  Compelling \nComplicity by the Federal Government in \nProcuring an Abortion. \n\n“[A]  State \n\nis  permitted  to  enact  persuasive \nmeasures which favor childbirth over abortion, even if \nthose  measures  do  not  further  a  health  interest.”  \nPlanned  Parenthood  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833,  886 \n(1992).    This  concept  is  central  to  the  longstanding \nprecedent that the federal government may fund the \ncosts  of  childbirth  while  refusing  to  fund  expenses \nrelating  to  abortion.    See  Harris  v.  McRae,  448  U.S. \n297, 325 (1980) (“Congress has [properly] established \nincentives  that  make  childbirth  a  more  attractive \nalternative than abortion.”). \n\nDespite  this,  a  concurring  opinion  below  stated \n\nthat: \n\nWhat is forcing J.D. to carry on this pregnancy is \nnot  J.D.’s  choice.  It  is  not  Texas  law.  It  is  the \nfederal government’s refusal to allow an abortion to \ngo  forward.  The  government’s  refusal  to  release \nJ.D. from custody is not just a substantial obstacle; \nit  is  a  full-on,  unqualified  denial  of  and  flat \nprohibition  on  J.D.’s  right  to  make  her  own \nreproductive choice. \n\n(Pet. App. 8a, Millett, J., concurring).   \n\nIn  fact  no  one,  and  certainly  not  the  federal \ngovernment, has been depriving J.D. of her full ability \n\n\f5 \n\nto  end  her  illegal  presence  in  this  country  by  simply \nreturning  home.    J.D.  entered  here  illegally  against \nthe will of the United States government and contrary \nto  applicable  law.    She  has  been  able  to  leave  this \ncountry at any time.  It would be as though someone \nhad  entered  a  religious  hospital  that  declines  to \nperform abortions and then refuses to leave until she \nobtains one at that hospital.  The Constitution does not \ncompel  a  religious  hospital  –  or  the  United  States \ngovernment – to be complicit in a sought-for abortion. \n\nB.  The Decision Below Erred in Assuming an \nIllegal Alien Has a Right to an Abortion. \nThe  United  States  is  not  a  sanctuary  for  all \nforeigners who want an elective abortion, particularly \nwhen the laws of their home country prohibit it, as in \nthis case.  Yet that is the basis of the ruling below, in \nassuming  that  a  foreigner  who  was  eight  weeks \npregnant when she illegally entered the United States \nsomehow has a constitutional right to obtain abortion \nhere.  J.D. is a trespasser on American soil, and has no \nlegitimate right to demand an abortion here. \n\nAn illegal alien has a status no greater than that of \na  trespasser  at  common  law,  who  may  be  properly \ndetained and restricted in movement, especially if the \ntrespasser  is  unwilling  to  leave.    A  landowner  who \nrestricts  the  movement  of  a  defiant  trespasser  is  not \nliable for false imprisonment.  See, e.g., Prinz v. Greate \nBay Casino Corp., 705 F.2d 692, 694 (3d Cir. 1983) (“If \nhe could not lawfully remain there was probable cause \nfor his detention as a defiant trespasser, which in New \nJersey \nfalse \nimprisonment.”).  \n\nis  a  defense \n\ncharge  of \n\nto  a \n\nMost  other  countries  of  the  world  properly  have \nlaws against abortion, in contrast with the framework \n\n\f6 \n\nof  unlimited  abortion  in  the  United  States  as \nestablished in Roe v. Wade, 410 U.S. 113 (1973), and \nDoe v. Bolton, 410 U.S. 179 (1973).  Elective abortion \nis illegal in the country from which J.D. came.  (Pet. \n37a)    Indeed,  elective  abortion  is  properly  illegal  in \nmuch  of  Central  and  South  America.    See,  e.g., \nJohanna  Zacarias,  Note:  “Suffering  in  Silence:  The \nUrgent  Need  to  Address  El  Salvador’s  Lack  of \nReproductive Rights,” 47 Geo. Wash. Int'l L. Rev. 233, \n239  (2015)  (“After  April  20,  1998,  all  abortions  - \nincluding those which were previously allowed - were \ncriminalized and [t]he abortion provisions were placed \nin a new section of the Penal Code that details offenses \nagainst the ‘human life in formation.’”). \n\nMiddle  Eastern  countries  likewise  have  laws \nagainst  abortion  that  are  stricter  than  in  the  United \nStates.   In Israel, for example, abortion is allowed only \nif  there  is  an  application  to  and  approval  by  a \nPregnancy  Termination  Committee,  and  “as  of  1993, \nlegal  access  to  abortion  had  been  narrowed  through \nstricter \nlimitations  on  the  discretion  of”  those \ncommittees to approve abortion.  Noya Rimalt, “When \nRights  Don’t  Talk:  Abortion  Law  and  the  Politics  of \nCompromise,”  28  Yale  J.L.  &  Feminism  327,  355 \n(2017).    Respect  for  abortion  laws  in  other  nations \nshould  benefit  from  the  same  level  of  international \ncomity  that  other  legal  issues  receive,  such  as  the \nmatter  of  personal  jurisdiction.    See  Daimler  AG  v. \nBauman,  134  S.  Ct.  746,  763  (2014)  (reversing  the \nNinth Circuit for having “paid little heed to the risks \nto  international  comity  its  expansive  view  of  general \njurisdiction posed”). \n\n \n \n\f7 \n\nIn  Plyler  v.  Doe,  a  5-4  Supreme  Court  ruled  that \nchildren of illegal aliens have a constitutional right to \nattend  public  schools  free  of  cost,  and  that  this  right \ncannot be denied by States.  But J.D. is an illegal alien \nherself,  and  the  rationale  in  Plyler  does  not  apply  to \nthe issue of whether an illegal alien herself has a right \nto an abortion: \n\nPersuasive arguments support the view that a \nState may withhold its beneficience from those \nwhose very presence within the United States \nis the product of their own unlawful conduct. \nThese arguments do not apply with the same force \nto classifications imposing disabilities on the minor \nchildren of such illegal entrants. At the least, those \nwho  elect  to  enter  our  territory  by  stealth  and  in \nviolation of our law should be prepared to bear the \nconsequences, \nlimited  to, \ndeportation.  \n\nincluding,  but  not \n\nPlyler v. Doe, 457 U.S. 202, 219-20 (1982) (emphasis in \noriginal).  Here illegally herself, J.D. has no right to a \nfree  public  education  under  the  Plyler  decision,  and \nshe has no constitutional right to an abortion in Texas. \n\nII. \n\nTHE  HURRIED,  MIDDLE-OF-THE-NIGHT \nABORTION  INCREASED  MEDICAL  RISK, \nUNDERMINED  INFORMED  CONSENT,  AND  IS \nORDERLY \nA \nTHE \nADMINISTRATION OF JUSTICE. \n\nBLIGHT \n\nON \n\nThe  hurried,  middle-of-the-night2  abortion  put  a \n17-year-old  girl  at  heightened  medical  risk,  and \n\n2 The abortion was scheduled for 4:15 a.m.  (Pet. 11) \n\n \n \n                                                 \n\f8 \n\ndeprived  her  of  fully  informed  consent  for  the  life-\nchanging  procedure. \n  Even  many  who  support \nlegalized abortion would agree that the circumstances \nand timing of the abortion below are not a proper way \nto terminate a pregnancy or resolve an ongoing legal \ndispute about one.  What transpired in this case is a \nblight  on  the  orderly  administration  of  justice,  and \nmight  be  characterized  by  a  future  observer  as \nuncivilized. \n\nHad  a  State  hurriedly  executed  a  prisoner  in  the \nmiddle of the night to avert review by this Court, there \nis  little  doubt  that  this  Court  would  harshly  and \nunanimously condemn it.  Such chicanery is even less \nappropriate in the context of an abortion, where fully \ninformed  consent  by  the  patient,  without  any  time \npressures, is essential. \n\nA.  Risk  of  Medical  Harm  Was  Increased  by \n\nthe Middle-of-the-Night Abortion. \n\nElective  surgery \n\nis  more  dangerous  when \nconducted  in  the  middle  of  the  night,  for  obvious \nreasons.  Surgeons are more likely to be fatigued, and \nless support staff is typically available both to assist in \nthe  procedure  and  to  address  complications.    The \npatient herself may be more fatigued.  Whatever the \ncauses,  night  surgery  is  widely  known  to  carry  an \nincreased risk of medical harm to the patient.  See, e.g., \n“Night  Surgeries  Linked  to  Risks,”  Business  Daily \n(Oct.  17,  2017)  (study  of  15,000  surgeries  showed  a \nmassive  50%  increase  in  complications  when  done \nbetween the hours of 9pm and 7am).3 \n\n3  https://www.msn.com/en-za/news/other/night-surgeries-linked-\nto-risks/ar-AAtFk2q (viewed 11/26/17). \n\n                                                 \n\f9 \n\nResearch  shows  that  sleep  deprivation  is  as \nharmful to clinical performance as alcohol intoxication \nis,  and  experts  advise  against  performing  elective \nsurgery under such circumstances: \n\nSleep  deprivation  adversely  affects \nperformance \nperformance as severely as alcohol intoxication. \n\nclinical \npsychomotor \n\nimpairs \n\nand \n\nMichael  Nurok,  M.D.,  Ph.D.,  Charles  A.  Czeisler, \nPh.D.,  M.D.,  and  Lisa  Soleymani  Lehmann,  M.D., \nPh.D., \n“Sleep  Deprivation,  Elective  Surgical \nProcedures, and Informed Consent,” N. Engl. J. Med. \n2010; 363:2577-2579 (Dec. 30, 2010).4 \n\nThe  rushed,  middle-of-the-night  abortion  on  J.D. \nput  her  at  unjustified  medical  risk.    It  may  not  be \nknown  for  years  if  her  cervix  was  damaged  by  the \nprocedure, thereby causing her problems with future \npregnancies.    Complications  from  abortion  include \nboth  immediate  harm  and  long-term  effects.    In \naddition  she  may  be  scarred  psychologically  by  the \ninherently  frightening  timing  of  the  procedure.  \nPatients  to  be  seen  the  following  day  by  the  same \npractitioners  were  also  jeopardized,  given  that  the \nsleep deprivation is as deleterious as intoxication. \n\nFor legal advantage, a foreign 17-year-old girl was \nsubjected  to  increased  risk  to  her  health,  in  order  to \nideologically  motivated  precedent.  \nestablish  an \nRegardless  of  whether  J.D.  or  ensuing  patients \nsuffered  actual  harm,  an  attempt  at  legal  advantage \ndoes  not  justify  inflicting  greater  medical  risk  on  a \nminor. \n\n4  http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp1007901  (viewed \n11/23/17). \n\n                                                 \n \n\f10 \n\nB.  The Right to Revoke Consent Is Deprived \nby  a  Time-Pressured,  Middle-of-the-Night \nAbortion. \n\nA  woman’s  right  to  revoke  consent  remains \nessential until the abortion begins, and she has a right \nto have full clarity of thought until that life-changing \nmoment.  Even in the context of capital punishment, \nwhere  no  consent \nis  required,  this  Court  has \nprohibited  executions  where  there  are  doubts  about \nthe  lack  of  clarity  of  mind.    See,  e.g.,  Panetti  v. \nQuarterman,  551  U.S.  930,  934  (2007)  (overturning \ncapital  punishment  where  doubts  were  raised  about \nthe mental clarity of the subject, observing that “‘the \nEighth  Amendment  prohibits  a  State  from  carrying \nout a sentence of death upon a prisoner who is insane.’  \nThe  prohibition  applies  despite  a  prisoner’s  earlier \ncompetency  to  be  held  responsible  for  committing  a \ncrime  and  to  be  tried  for it.”)  (quoting  Ford  v. \nWainwright, 477 U.S. 399, 409-410 (1986)). \n\nHad J.D. confessed to a crime under circumstances \nsimilar  to  how  the  abortion  was  performed,  her \nconfession would likely be deemed non-consensual and \ninadmissible. The Ninth Circuit held as follows: \n\nCommencing the interrogation of a teenager after \nmidnight,  and  pressing  it  past  3:00  a.m.,  absent \nsome showing that delay would risk the destruction \nof evidence or other such harm, creates far too great \na  risk  that  a  false  confession  will  be  extracted, \nleading  to  the  unjust  conviction  of  an  innocent \nperson. \n\nTaylor v. Maddox, 366 F.3d 992, 1013 (9th Cir.), cert. \ndenied, 543 U.S. 1038 (2004). \n\n\f11 \n\nJ.D. was merely 17 years old while in a land foreign \nto her, and one can only wonder what she was told to \nexplain why the abortion was being done in the middle \nof the night.  This Court held the following about an \ninterrogation  of  a  15-year-old  boy  in  “the  dead  of \nnight”: \n\nAge 15 is a tender and difficult age for a boy of any \nrace.  He  cannot  be  judged  by  the  more  exacting \nstandards  of  maturity.  That  which  would  leave  a \nman  cold  and  unimpressed  can  overawe  and \noverwhelm  a  lad  in  his  early  teens.  This  is  the \nperiod  of  great  instability  which  the  crisis  of \nlad, \nadolescence \nquestioned through the dead of night by relays of \npolice, is a ready victim of the inquisition. \n\nproduces.  A \n\n15-year-old \n\nHaley v. Ohio, 332 U.S. 596, 599 (1948). \n\nIt is plausible, even likely, that J.D. did not feel she \nhad much of a choice to decline the middle-of-the-night \nabortion,  or  to  request  more  time  to  reconsider \nwhether  to  have  it.    She  was  probably  told  it  was \nnecessary  to  have  it  done  immediately,  and  she  may \nhave felt she did not have a right to change her mind.  \nThat is not true consent, and that is inconsistent with \nthe  applicable  Texas  law  requiring  informed  consent \nafter  counseling.    See  Pet.  69a,  ¶  6  (referencing \napplication  of  Texas’s  “state-mandated  counseling” \nrequirement). \n\nC.  The  Abortion  Violated \nAdministration of Justice. \n\nthe  Orderly \n\nZealous \n\nrepresentation \n\nend  where \nunnecessary  risks  to  health  and  safety  begin, \nparticularly  for  a  minor  such  as  J.D.    Moreover,  the \norderly administration of justice depends on respect by \n\nshould \n\n\f12 \n\nofficers of the court – its licensed attorneys – for legal \nprocedure.  Deference to the orderly procedure of this \nCourt was lacking in the rushed abortion below. \n\nWere this a case of capital punishment rather than \nan  abortion  dispute,  there  is  little  doubt  that  this \nCourt would discipline any attorney who arranged for \na  surprise  execution  by  a  State  in  order  to  deny  this \nCourt  full  review  of  the  issue.    The  integrity  of  legal \nprocess  suffers  if  such  conduct  goes  unaddressed.  \nIndeed, it is difficult to see why such conduct would not \nbe repeated in future cases, if there is no sanction of it \nhere. \n\n“An  attorney  acts  not  only  as  a  client’s \nrepresentative, but also as an officer of the court, and \nhas a duty to serve both masters.”  Bus. Guides, Inc. v. \nChromatic  Communs.  Enters.,  498  U.S.  533,  564 \n(1991).    The  conduct  in  procuring  the  middle-of-the-\nnight abortion, as recounted by Petitioner (Pet. 10-17), \ndoes not comport with the obligations of an attorney to \nserve as an officer of the Court. \n\nIn both Roe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton, the plaintiffs \nopposed  or  regretted  positions  that  their  attorneys \ntook.  In Doe, the plaintiff Sandra Cano later testified \nbefore  the  United  States  Senate  Committee  on  the \nJudiciary that she never even sought an abortion: \n\nI only sought legal assistance to get a divorce from \nmy  husband  and  to  get  my  children  from  foster \ncare. I was very vulnerable: poor and pregnant with \nmy  fourth  child,  but  abortion  never  crossed  my \nmind.    Although  it  apparently  was  utmost  in  the \nmind of the attorney from whom I sought help. At \none point during the legal proceedings, it was \nnecessary for me to flee to Oklahoma to avoid \n\n\f13 \n\nthe  pressure  being  applied  to  have  the \nabortion  scheduled  for  me  by  this  same \nattorney.  Please  understand  even  though  I  have \nlived  what  many  would  consider  an  unstable  life \nand overcome many devastating circumstances, at \nNO TIME did I ever have an abortion. I did not seek \nan abortion nor do I believe in abortion. \n\nLinda L. Schlueter, “40th Anniversary of Roe v. Wade: \nReflections Past, Present and Future,” 40 Ohio N.U.L. \nRev. 105, 122-123 (2013) (quoting the Hearing Before \nthe  Subcomm.  on  the  Constitution,  Civil  Rights,  and \nProperty  Rights,  of  the  S.  Judiciary  Comm.,  109th \nCong.  (2005),  statement  of  Sandra  Cano,  emphasis \nadded).   \n\nAs to the “Roe” in Roe v. Wade, the plaintiff Norma \nMcCorvey  later  brought  a  lawsuit  in  an  attempt  to \nreverse the outcome that had supposedly been in her \nfavor.  While this Court declined to review her appeal, \nJudge  Edith  Jones  on  the  Fifth  Circuit  remarked  on \nhow  “the  Court  will  never  be  able  to  examine  its \nfactual  assumptions  on  a  record  made  in  court.”  \nMcCorvey  v.  Hill,  385  F.3d  846,  852  (5th  Cir.  2004) \n(Jones,  J.,  concurring),  cert.  denied,  543  U.S.  1154 \n(2005).  “Thus, the ‘facts’ that gave rise to the cases of \nRoe v. Wade and Doe v. Bolton were based on lies and \ndeception.”  Schlueter, supra at 123. \n\nto \n\nare \n\nlimits \n\nThere \n\nnecessary \n\nzealous \nrepresentation.  “The obligations owed by the attorney \nto the client are defined by the professional codes, not \nby  the  …  entity  from  which  …  compensation  is \nderived.”    Polk  Cty.  v.  Dodson,  454  U.S.  312,  327 \n(1981).    Subjecting  a  17-year-old  foreign  girl  to \nheightened medical risk, and depriving her of her full \nright  to  revoke  consent,  in  a  rushed  elective  medical \n\n\f14 \n\noperation  timed  to  deprive  this  Court  of  jurisdiction, \ntransgresses  those  limits.    Such  conduct  interfered \nwith the orderly administration of justice in a shocking \nmanner, and should be addressed accordingly by this \nCourt. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons and  those  stated  in  the \nPetition for a Writ of Certiorari, it should be granted. \n\n Respectfully submitted, \n\nANDREW L.
