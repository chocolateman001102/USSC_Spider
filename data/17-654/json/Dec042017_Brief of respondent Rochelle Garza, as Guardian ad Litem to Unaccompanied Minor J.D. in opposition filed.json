        "INTRODUCTION \n\nJane Doe is a 17-year-old who came to this country \nwithout  her  parents.1  She  was  apprehended  by  the \nU.S.  government  and  has  been  detained  since \nSeptember  2017  in  a  shelter  run  by  a  federal \ngovernment  grantee.  After  receiving  a  medical \nexamination  and  being  informed  she  was  pregnant, \nMs. Doe told shelter staff that she wanted an abortion. \nWith the help of two court-appointed representatives, \nshe  received  permission  from  a  Texas  state  court  to \nbypass the State’s parental consent law and to consent \nto  the  abortion  herself.  She  then  sought  to  attend \nstate-mandated  pre-abortion  counseling  at  a  local \nclinic. Pursuant to a policy adopted in March 2017 by \nthe  Director  of  the  Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement \n(ORR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS)—and in stark contrast to the policies \nof U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nand  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  (BOP)—the  government \nrefused  to  allow  Ms.  Doe  to  attend  any  abortion-\nrelated appointments.  \n\nMs. Doe brought suit in federal district court seeking \nto enforce her right to an abortion, consistent with the \nConstitution  and  the  state  court’s  order.  The \ngovernment  did  not  contest  Ms.  Doe’s  claim  that  she \nhas  a  constitutional  right  to  an  abortion.  Nor  did  it \nargue  that  allowing  her  to  attend  the  appointments \nwould  violate  statutory  restrictions  on  the  use  of \nfederal  funds  or  any  federal  regulations.  Instead,  it \nargued that it should not have to “facilitate” her access \nto an abortion—even if it did not pay for, or transport \nMs.  Doe  to,  any  appointments.  Because  she  was  in \nfederal  custody,  this  policy  prevented  Ms.  Doe  from \n\n1 Respondent Garza is Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem.",
        "2 \n\nexercising what the government did not contest is her \nconstitutional right.    \n\nOn  October  18,  2017,  the  district  court  issued  a \ntemporary restraining order (TRO) that, among other \nthings,  directed  the  defendants  to  allow  Ms.  Doe  to \nattend the necessary appointments. The same day, the \ngovernment  sought  an  emergency  stay  pending \nappeal,  which  a  panel  of  the  D.C.  Circuit  granted  in \npart on October 20. On October 24, however, the D.C. \nCircuit  en  banc  granted  rehearing  and  denied  the \ngovernment’s emergency request for a stay. This time, \nthe government did not seek an immediate stay, even \nthough nothing precluded it from doing so. On the next \nday,  October  25,  one  month  after  the  state  court \nauthorized Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she finally \nhad the procedure.  \n\nHaving  failed  to  seek  an  emergency  stay  from  this \nCourt on October 24, as it had from the D.C. Circuit on \nthe  day  the  district  court  granted  the  TRO,  the \ngovernment  filed  this  petition  nine  days  after  the \nevents that it claims have rendered the issues in this \ncase moot. The government does not seek review of the \nsingle  legal  issue  decided  by  the  court  of  appeals—\nwhether  the  government’s  application  for  a  stay \npending appeal met the standards for obtaining such \nrelief.  Rather,  it  asks  this  Court  to  vacate  that \nemergency,  interlocutory  ruling  on  the  ground  that \nsome of Ms. Doe’s claims for relief have been mooted \nby  her  abortion.  The  government  then  suggests  that \nthis  Court  should  decide,  in  the  first  instance,  that \nclaims Ms. Doe seeks to bring on behalf of herself and \na class are likewise moot and dismiss those claims now \nwhile \nin  district  court. \nSimultaneously,  the  government  suggests  that  this \nCourt should consider issuing an order to show cause \n\nthey  remain  pending",
        "3 \n\nwhy  disciplinary  action  should  not  be  taken  against \nrespondent’s  counsel  “in  light  of  the  extraordinary \ncircumstances of this case.” Pet. 26.  \n\nit \n\nit \n\nof \n\nBut \n\nreview; \n\nis  the  government’s  petition  that \n\nis \nextraordinary:  The  government  asks  this  Court  to \ngrant  certiorari  without  identifying  any  question \nworthy \nseeks  vacatur  under \ncircumstances  that  the  government  has  repeatedly \nargued  do  not  warrant  this  Court’s  intervention;  it \nasks this Court to direct dismissal of an array of claims \nnot implicated by the decision below before any lower \ncourt  has  passed  on  them;  and  it  suggests  that  this \nCourt consider disciplinary action against lawyers for \nfaithfully fulfilling their ethical duties to their client.  \n\nThe  petition  should  be  denied  for  at  least  three \nreasons. First, as the government acknowledges, even \nwhere a case has become moot, the Court should not \ngrant  review  for  purposes  of  vacating a lower  court’s \ndecision unless the petition independently presents an \nissue that would have been worthy of review prior to \nbecoming moot. Yet the government identifies no such \nissue.  The  only  question  decided  below  was  whether \nthe government had met the requirements for a stay \nof  a  TRO  pending  appeal.  That  narrow,  fact-bound \nissue, as to which the court of appeals applied the legal \nstandard urged by both sides, is not remotely worthy \nof  this  Court’s  review.  No  other  issues  are  presented \nbecause the court below did not decide any.   \n\nSecond, even if the decision below presented an issue \nworthy  of  this  Court’s  review,  the  relief  the \ngovernment  seeks  would  not  be  warranted.  The \ngovernment’s argument that this Court should vacate \nthe  decision  below  and  direct  the  dismissal  of  all \nclaims  for  prospective  relief  regarding  pregnant",
        "4 \n\nunaccompanied  minors  on  the  grounds  that  they  are \nmoot  is  erroneous.  The  claims  in  this  case  regarding \nthe treatment of pregnant minors are currently being \nlitigated in the district court, and finding that they are \nmoot  would  contravene \nthis  Court’s  decisions \nrecognizing  exceptions  to  mootness  in  cases  like  this \none where the factual basis for the claim is of a fleeting \nnature.   \n\nThird, vacatur is intended to protect parties who are \nprevented from appealing and who would be harmed \nby  the  binding  effects  of  the  mooted  ruling  on  future \nlitigation.  In  this  case,  however,  and  consistent  with \nestablished  law,  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  interlocutory \ndecision  denying  a  stay  has  no  preclusive  effect  on \nfuture  litigation.  Moreover,  the  government  failed  to \ntake  the  steps  necessary  to  preserve  its  appellate \nrights, and in all events retains a full opportunity to \nseek  review  of  the  future  litigation  following  final \njudgment on those claims.  \n\nFinally, the government’s suggestion that this Court \nshould  consider  issuing  an  order  to  show  cause  why \nrespondent’s  counsel  should  not  be  disciplined \nprovides  no  basis  to  find  that  counsel’s  conduct \npresents grounds for concern, much less sanction. The \npetition does not present legal or factual grounds  for \nits  suggestion  that  respondent’s  counsel  may  have \nviolated any applicable rule of professional conduct. To \nthe  contrary,  the  government’s  recitation  of  events \nshows that it failed to seek a stay from this Court in a \ntimely  manner  based  on  assumptions  it  made  about \nthe timing of Ms. Doe’s procedure, not on the basis of \nany commitments from Ms. Doe’s lawyers.",
        "5 \n\nCOUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nA.  Facts \n\nIn early September 2017, Jane Doe, a young woman \nof 17, entered the United States without her parents. \nShe was apprehended by U.S. authorities and placed \nin  HHS  custody  in  a  shelter  run  by  a  federal \ngovernment  grantee  in  Texas.  Through  ORR,  HHS \nexercises its responsibility for the “care and custody of \nall  unaccompanied \nincluding \nalien \nresponsibility for their detention, where appropriate.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  A  nationwide  consent  decree \nrequires ORR and its shelters to provide “appropriate \nroutine medical . . . care, family planning services, and \nemergency  health \nservices.”  Stipulated \nSettlement  Agreement,  Ex.  1  at  1,  Flores  v.  Reno,  \nNo. CV-85-4544 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 1997). \n\nchildren, \n\ncare \n\nletter \n\ninforming  grantees  of \n\nOn March 4, 2017, the Acting Director of ORR issued \na \nits  policy  of \n“prohibit[ing]  [shelters]  from  taking  any  action  that \nfacilitates an abortion without direction and approval \nfrom  the  Director  of  ORR,”  D.D.C.  Dkt.  No.  3-5,  a \npolicy  that  effectively  gives  the  ORR  Director  veto \npower over a young woman’s abortion decision. \n\nOnce in HHS custody, Ms. Doe was given a medical \nexamination  and  told  that  she  was  pregnant. \n10/17/2017  White  Decl.  ¶  7.  She  informed  her \ncustodians  that  she  wished  to  terminate  the \npregnancy. Id. ¶ 8. ORR directed the shelter to inform \nMs.  Doe’s  mother  of  her  pregnancy  over  Ms.  Doe’s \nobjection.  Appellee’s  Opp.  to  Mot.  for  Stay  Pending \nAppeal  7  (Oct.  19,  2017).  The  government  also \nrequired Ms. Doe to attend a counseling session at an \nanti-abortion  center.  10/13/2017  Amiri  Decl.  ¶  2; \n10/11/2017 Doe Decl. ¶ 13.",
        "6 \n\nTo  obtain  an  abortion  under  Texas  law,  a  minor \nmust obtain parental consent or a court order finding \nthat  she  “is  mature  and  sufficiently  well informed  to \nmake the decision” on her own, or that “the notification \nand attempt to obtain consent would not be in the best \ninterest  of  the  minor.”  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Ann. \n§ 33.003(i)(1)–(2). A state court appointed a guardian \nad  litem  and  an  attorney  ad  litem  for  Ms.  Doe  and, \nwith  their  assistance,  she  received  a  court  order  on \nSeptember 25 granting her authority to consent to an \nabortion  without  the  knowledge  or  consent  of  her \nparents or legal guardian. Pet. App. 69a.  \n\nUnder  Texas  law,  Ms.  Doe  first  had  to  attend \ncounseling at least 24 hours in advance of the abortion \nwith the physician who would perform the procedure. \nPet. App. 70a. When Ms. Doe requested permission to \nattend that counseling on September 27, ORR refused. \n10/17/2017 White Decl. ¶ 10.2  \n\nORR  took  this  position  notwithstanding  contrary \nICE  and  BOP  policies  that  allow  detained  women  to \nobtain  abortions,  and  despite  the  government’s \nposition in this case that Ms. Doe would have been free \nto have an abortion if ORR placed her with a sponsor, \nsee  Appellants’  Emergency  Mot.  for  Stay  Pending \nAppeal 11 (Oct. 18, 2017). \n\nB.  Procedural History \n\nOn  October  13,  2017,  Ms.  Doe’s  guardian  ad  litem \nfiled suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia  against  the  Acting  Secretary  of  HHS  and \n\n2 In response, Ms. Doe filed a lawsuit in Texas state court on \nOctober 5, alleging state-law neglect by the shelter. That case is \nsealed and has been removed to federal court. Appellee’s Opp. to \nMot. for Stay Pending Appeal 10 n.6 (Oct. 19, 2017).",
        "7 \n\nother department officials on behalf of Ms. Doe and a \nputative  class  of  “all  other  pregnant  unaccompanied \nin  ORR  custody  nationwide, \nimmigrant  minors \nincluding those who will become pregnant during the \npendency of this lawsuit,” Compl. ¶ 47. The complaint \nalleges,  among  other  things,  that  the  defendants \nviolated  the  Constitution  by  “obstructing,  interfering \nwith, or blocking [the minors’] access to abortion” and \nby  revealing \n[the  minors’] \n“information  about \npregnancy  and  abortions  to  their  parents  or  other \nfamily members, including immigration sponsors.” Id. \n¶¶ 55–56.  Respondent  simultaneously  sought  a  TRO \nto  prevent  the  government  “from  obstructing  [Ms. \nDoe’s]  access  to  abortion.”  Id.  at  15.  On  October  18, \nrespondent moved for class certification.  \n\nThe district court granted a TRO later on October 18, \nrequiring defendants either to transport Ms. Doe or to \nallow  her  to be  transported  “to  the  abortion  provider \nclosest to [the] shelter in order to obtain the counseling \nrequired  by  state  law  on  October  19,  2017,  and  to \nobtain  the  abortion  procedure  on  October  20,  2017 \nand/or  October  21,  2017,  as  dictated  by  the  abortion \nproviders’ availability and any medical requirements.” \nPet  App.  73a.  It  also  temporarily  restrained  the \ndefendants  from  “further  forcing  [Ms.  Doe]  to  reveal \nher  abortion  decision  to  anyone,  or  revealing  it  to \nanyone themselves” or from retaliating against her or \nthe  shelter.  Id.  at  74a.  Within  five  hours  that  same \nday, the government not only filed a notice of appeal \nin the D.C. Circuit, but also an emergency motion for \na stay pending appeal, and a request for a temporary \nadministrative  stay  while  the  court  considered  the \nstay pending appeal. Pet. 8.  \n\nOn  October  19,  a  panel  of  the  D.C.  Circuit \nadministratively  stayed  the  TRO  to  the  extent  it",
        "8 \n\npertained  to  Ms.  Doe’s  transportation  to  obtain  an \nabortion  on  October  20  or  21.  Order  (Oct.  19,  2017). \nThe  court  did  not  stay  other  parts  of  the  TRO, \nincluding  the  portion  relating  to  the  counseling \nappointment on October 19. Id. Ms. Doe received state-\nmandated counseling on October 19. Pet. 11. \n\nFollowing  oral  argument,  the  panel  issued  a  per \ncuriam decision on October 20 in which it vacated the \nportion  of  the  TRO  that  required  the  defendants  to \ntransport Ms. Doe to either counseling or an abortion. \nThe  panel  noted  that  the  government  “has  assumed, \nfor purposes of this case, that [Ms. Doe] . . . possesses \na  constitutional  right  to  obtain  an  abortion  in  the \nUnited States.” Pet. App. 2a–3a. The panel found that \nreleasing Ms. Doe to a sponsor, which the government \nstated  it  was  attempting  to  do,  “does  not  unduly \nburden  the  minor’s  right  under  Supreme  Court \nprecedent to an abortion . . . . so long as the process of \nsecuring  a  sponsor  to  whom  the  minor  is  released \noccurs expeditiously.” Id. at 2a (emphasis added). The \ncourt  therefore  remanded  to  the  district  court  with \ninstructions  to  allow  HHS  eleven  more  days—until \n5:00  p.m.  on  October  31—to  secure  a  sponsor  and \nrelease  Ms.  Doe.  If  no  sponsor  was  approved  in  that \ntime, the order provided that Ms. Doe could seek a new \nTRO  “or  other  appropriate  order,”  which  the \ngovernment “may . . . immediately appeal.” Id.  \n\nJudge Millett dissented. She pointed out that there \nwas  no  “factual  basis  to  think  that  remand  will \naccomplish anything but a forced continuation” of Ms. \nDoe’s  pregnancy,  given  the  government’s  failure  to \nidentify a sponsor after six weeks. Pet App. 13a. Judge \nMillett observed, moreover, that the vetting process for \nrigorous”  and \n“understandably \nsponsors  was \ncontrolled  by  HHS.  Id.  On  the  other  side  of  the",
        "9 \n\nbalance, Judge Millett wrote, “[e]very day that goes by \nis another day that the federal government forces [Ms. \nDoe]  to  carry  an  unwanted  pregnancy  forward.  Days \nalso  increase  the  health  risks  associated  with  an \nabortion  procedure . . . .  [I]f  [she]  is  17  or  18  weeks \nalong by the time this issue is resolved, the doctors at \nthe South Texas clinic nearest to her (assuming it still \nhas  availability)  will  likely  no  longer  be  willing  to \nperform the procedure.” Id. at 14a. \n\nOn Sunday, October 22, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem \nfiled  an  emergency  petition  for  rehearing  en  banc  in \nthe D.C. Circuit. Shortly before 2 p.m. Central Time3 \non  October  24,  the  D.C.  Circuit  en  banc  granted  the \npetition  for  rehearing  and  denied  the  government’s \nmotion for a stay pending appeal. The court concluded \nthat  the  government  had  “not  met  the  stringent \nrequirements for a stay pending appeal, substantially \nfor  the  reasons”  set  forth  in  Judge  Millett’s  dissent \nfrom  the  panel  decision.  Pet.  App.  19a  (citation \nomitted). At this point in time, the government could \nhave immediately sought a stay from this Court,4 just \nas it had immediately sought a stay from the court of \nappeals when the district court entered the TRO. But \nit chose not to.  \n\nFollowing  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  decision,  Ms.  Doe’s \nguardian ad litem filed an emergency motion to amend \nthe TRO in the district court. Pet. 10. The district court \ngranted the motion shortly after 4 p.m. on October 24 \nand  issued  an  amended  TRO  that  required  the \ndefendants  to  transport  Ms.  Doe,  or  allow  her  to  be \ntransported,  “promptly  and  without  delay,  on  such \n\n3 All times listed in this brief reflect Central Time. \n\n4 See Sup.

App.  66a.  Again,  the  government  could  have \nsought a stay from this Court at this point, but did not.  \n\nC.  Post-TRO Events  \n\nUpon receiving the amended TRO at about 4:15 p.m., \nMs.  Doe’s  guardian  ad  litem  emailed  shelter  and \nDepartment  of  Justice  (DOJ)  personnel  requesting \nthat they transport Ms. Doe to the clinic.

Pet’rs’ Ex. E.  \n\nAt  6:17  p.m.,  Ms.  Doe’s  attorney  emailed  DOJ \nattorneys to say that the doctor was unable to stay that \nevening,  and  that  “[t]he  ad  litems  will  arrange  with \nthe  shelter  to  have  [Ms.  Doe]  arrive  at  the  clinic  at  \n7:30  a.m.”  the  next  morning.  Pet’rs’  Ex.  F.  A  few \nminutes  later,  Ms.  Doe’s  guardian  informed  shelter \nand DOJ personnel that Ms. Doe “has an appointment \ntomorrow morning at 7:30 a.m.” at the clinic and “must \nbe there on time.” Pet’rs’ Ex. G. The shelter confirmed \nthat it would make “necessary arrangements to ensure \nminor is present.” Pet’rs’ Ex. H.   \n\nAt  8:13  p.m.,  another  DOJ  attorney  emailed  Ms. \nDoe’s attorneys to say that DOJ intended to seek a stay \nfrom  the  Supreme  Court  the  next  morning.  Resp’ts’ \nEx. 1.  One  of  Ms.  Doe’s  attorneys  emailed  back  to \nthank the attorney for letting him know. Id. \n\nAt 9:31 p.m., Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem informed \nshelter  and  DOJ  personnel \nthat  Ms.  Doe’s \n“appointment  has  been  moved  to  4:15  a.m.  at  the \naddress  provided.”  Pet’rs’  Ex.

In response to DOJ inquiries, Ms. \nDoe’s  attorney  confirmed  this  fact  in  an  email  at  \n9:00 a.m. Pet. 15.   \n\nAlthough the petition states that at the time Ms. Doe \nhad her abortion the government “believed that it had \nidentified  a  potentially  suitable  sponsor,”  and \n“believed that the process could be completed within a \nweek,” id. at 6, it is now more than a month later, and \nthe government still has not approved a sponsor; Ms. \nDoe remains in ORR custody. Had it not been for court \nintervention, Ms. Doe would still be pregnant, against \nher will, today.",
        "13 \n\nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \n\nI.  THE  DECISION  BELOW  DOES  NOT \nPRESENT  A  LEGAL  ISSUE  WORTHY  OF \nTHIS COURT’S REVIEW. \n\nHaving failed to seek a timely stay, the government \nnow asks the Court to grant review of an interlocutory \norder  that  it  contends  is  moot.  By  the  government’s \nown  reasoning,  the  underlying  decision  presents  no \nmerits issues on which the Court could rule, even if it \nwere  so  inclined.  Instead,  the  government  asks  the \nCourt  to  grant  review  to  vacate  the  D.C.  Circuit’s \ndecision, a form of relief this Court has described as an \n“extraordinary  remedy,”  U.S.  Bancorp  Mortg.  Co.  v. \nBonner Mall P’ship, 513 U.S. 18, 26 (1994).   \n\nTo  succeed  in  this  unusual  plea,  the  government \nmust—consistent  with  its  own  longstanding  view—\ndemonstrate that the case would have independently \nwarranted  this  Court’s  review  had  it  not  become  (in \nthe government’s view) moot. See Pet. 23 n.4. It “has \nbeen the consistent position of the United States” that \n“the Court should deny review of cases (or claims) that \nhave  become  moot  after  the  court  of  appeals  entered \nits  judgment  but  before  this  Court  has  acted  on  the \npetition,  when  such  cases  (or  claims)  do  not  present \nany  question  that  would  independently  be  worthy  of \nthis Court’s review.” U.S. Amicus Br. at 10, McFarling \nv.  Monsanto  Co.,  545  U.S.  1139  (2005)  (No.  04-31) \n(cert.  denied);  see  U.S.  Br.  in  Opp.  at  5–8,  Velsicol \nChem. Corp. v. United States, 435 U.S. 942 (1978) (No. \n77-900)  (cert.  denied);  Stephen  M.  Shapiro  et  al., \nSupreme  Court  Practice §  19.4,  at  968  n.33  (10th  ed. \n2013)  (noting  that  the  Court  appears  to  follow  the \ngovernment’s approach). This rule recognizes that this \n“discretionary  and  exercised \nCourt’s  review \n\nis",
        "14 \n\ncircumspectly,”  and  that  “there  is  no  unfairness  in \nleaving  the  lower  court’s  decision  intact”  where  “the \nCourt would have denied certiorari in any event.” U.S. \nBr.  in  Opp.  at  12–13,  Enron  Power  Mktg.,  Inc.  v.

In \nfact, the petition barely presents any affirmative legal \nargument that the D.C. Circuit’s decision would have \nwarranted this Court’s review if the government had \nsought  review  on  the  merits.  It  does  not  directly \nclaim—because  it  cannot—that  the  court  of  appeals’ \ndecision  denying  a  stay  conflicts  with  any  other \ncircuit’s decision, or with a prior decision of this Court. \nSee  Sup.  Ct.  R.  10.  Instead,  the  petition  contains  a \nsingle sentence that merely notes that prior decisions \nof  this  Court  support  the  view  that  “the  government \ngenerally  need  not  facilitate  abortions.”  Pet.  22 \n(emphasis added).  \n\nThe lower court did not, however, resolve the merits \nof Ms. Doe’s constitutional claim or the government’s \nargument  that  its  refusal  to  “facilitate”  Ms.  Doe’s \nabortion  did  not  impose  an  unconstitutional  “undue \nburden” on Ms. Doe.6 The only matter decided below—\nand  therefore  the  only  question  the  government’s \npetition  could  have  presented—was  whether  the \ngovernment’s emergency motion for a stay of the TRO \npending  appeal  should  be  denied  because  the \n\n6 Because the government did not dispute below that Ms. Doe \nhas a constitutional right to an abortion, it does not and could not \nappropriately raise that issue here.",
        "15 \n\ngovernment had “not met the stringent requirements” \nfor such relief. Pet. App. 19a.  \n\nThat narrow question is manifestly unworthy of this \nCourt’s review. Indeed, the government does not claim \notherwise.  Nor  does  it  raise  that  legal  issue  for  this \nCourt’s consideration. See Pet. I. And for good reason. \nThe test for a stay pending appeal is highly fact-bound \nand inherently individualized. See Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S.  418,  426  (2009)  (court  weighs  multiple  factors: \napplicant’s likelihood of success on the merits, whether \napplicant  will  suffer  irreparable  injury,  balance  of \nhardships, and public interest).7 The petition does not \nargue  that  the  court  of  appeals  applied  the  incorrect \nlegal  test.  And  review  of  the  court  of  appeals’ \napplication of Nken to the facts here is plainly not the \nstuff of certiorari. See Sup. Ct. R. 10; c.f., U.S. Br. in \nOpp. at 8, Walmer v. Dep’t of Def., 516 U.S. 974 (1995) \n(No. 95-230) (cert. denied) (urging denial of review of \npreliminary injunction ruling where the only question \nproperly presented is the application of the established \nstandard to “case-specific” facts). \n\nEven  if  the  court  of  appeals  had  ruled  on  the \nconstitutionality of the government’s actions—and in \nmerely denying a stay pending appeal it manifestly did \nnot—such a decision would not conflict with any of the \ncases the government cites. In those cases, the Court \nactions  were \nfound \nconstitutional  because  they  “place[d]  no  obstacles—\nabsolute or otherwise—in the pregnant woman’s path \nto  an  abortion.”  Harris  v.  McRae,  448  U.S.  297,  314 \n(1980)  (quoting  Maher  v.

Casey,  505  U.S.  833,  876 \n(1992) (undue burden standard). Because Ms. Doe was \n(and still is) in U.S. custody, the government’s refusal \nto permit her to attend her appointments places her in \na wholly different position.   \n\n  The  petition  does  not,  moreover,  explain  why  the \ngovernment  has  an  interest  in  restricting  access  to \nabortions by minors in its custody, but not adults in its \ncustody.  The  government  does  not  dispute  that  it \ntransports women and “arrange[s]” for abortions when \nthey  are  in  ICE  or  BOP  custody.8  Yet,  in  apparent \nconflict with these policies, the government states that \nany steps to provide access to an abortion give rise to \nthe interests it asserts, even if the government were to \nplay no role in transporting or paying for an abortion. \nSee Appellants’ Resp. to Pet. for Reh’g En Banc 11–12 \n(Oct.  23,  2017).9  Indeed,  in  its  efforts  to  defeat  class \ncertification,  the  government  now  represents  in  the \nongoing district court proceedings that HHS does not \nhave  a  “policy”  prohibiting  minors  from  attending \nabortion-related appointments and questions whether \nthere  are  any  other  cases  in  which  the  defendants \n\n8 See ICE, Detention Standard 4.4, Medical Care (Women), at \n325  (revised  Dec.  2016),  https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-\nstandards/2011/4-4.pdf (if an ICE detainee requests abortion, ICE \n“shall arrange for transportation at no cost” to the detainee); 28 \nC.F.R. § 551.23(c) (federal inmate may decide whether to have an \nabortion and, if she does, “the Clinical Director shall arrange for \nan abortion to take place”). \n\n9 See also Pet.

This  Court’s  review  of \ninterlocutory  determinations  is  the  exception  rather \nthan the rule. See Va. Military Inst. v. United States, \n508  U.S.  946,  946  (1993)  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in \ndenial  of  writ  of  certiorari).  Here,  the  government \nitself argued that en banc review was “premature” and \n“inappropriate at this interlocutory stage of the case” \nbecause of the lack of a well-developed factual record \ngiven the expedited proceedings. Appellants’ Resp. to \nPet. for Reh’g En Banc 12–14 (Oct. 23, 2017) (focusing \non claims about the sponsorship process and Ms. Doe’s \nimmigration  status);  see  also  Pet.  App.  63a  n.6 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (factual record in this case \nis both “under-developed” and “still unclear and hotly \ncontested”). \n\nIn short, the petition fails to show—or even to argue \nin full—that the decision below warrants this Court’s \nreview. \n\nII.  MS.  DOE’S  CLAIMS  REGARDING  THE \nTREATMENT OF PREGNANT MINORS ARE \nNOT MOOT. \n\nThe  only  question the  government  presents  for  the \nCourt’s  review  is  whether  it  should  vacate  the  D.C. \nCircuit’s  decision  and  remand  with  instructions  to \ndismiss  “all  claims  for  prospective  relief  regarding \npregnant unaccompanied minors” on the ground that \nsuch claims were mooted by Ms. Doe’s abortion. Pet. I, \n19 (emphasis added). The government fails, however,",
        "18 \n\nto demonstrate that any of the claims for prospective \nrelief in Ms. Doe’s complaint regarding the treatment \nof  pregnant  unaccompanied  minors  are  moot.  The \nrelief  it  requests  from  this  Court—vacatur  of  the \ndenial of a stay pending appeal followed by dismissal \nof  an  array  of  claims  that  are  still  being  litigated \nbelow—is therefore unwarranted.10 \n\nAs an initial matter, Ms. Doe indisputably has live \nclaims for injunctive relief to prevent the government \nfrom retaliating against her for her decision to have an \nabortion and to prevent it from disclosing information \nabout  her abortion  decision  to third  parties.  See  Pet. \nApp.  67a  (amended  TRO);  Order  (Oct.  30,  2017) \n(extending  portions  of  the  TRO);  Compl.  16.  The \ngovernment appears to agree that these claims remain \nlive.  See  Pet.  24  (discussing  disclosure  claim).11  Ms. \nDoe also seeks to bring these claims on behalf of the \nclass. Compl. 16. \n\nIn  addition,  Ms.  Doe’s  claims  regarding  access  to \nabortion—for  which  she  also  seeks  injunctive  relief, \nCompl. 15–16—fall  into  established  exceptions  to \nmootness.  See,  e.g.,  Roe  v.  Wade,  410  U.S.  113,  125 \n(1973) (“[p]regnancy provides a classic justification for \na conclusion of nonmootness”). This is particularly the \ncase here, where Ms. Doe brings these claims on behalf \nof both herself and a class of minors in HHS custody. \n\n10 The  government  does  not  claim—indeed  it  could  not—that \nvacatur  is  warranted  because  the  case  has  become  moot.  Thus, \neven  in  its  own  view,  the  Court’s  “general  practice”  under \nMunsingwear would not be appropriate here. Pet. 24. Instead, it \nrequests that this Court decide in the first instance that certain \nof Ms. Doe’s claims are moot and direct their dismissal.  \n\n11 Indeed,  the  government  has  filed  a  still-pending  motion \nseeking  to  modify  the  TRO  to  permit  it  to  disclose  Ms.  Doe’s \nabortion.

        "19 \n\nCompl.  ¶¶  55–56.  Indeed,  courts  have  recognized  in \nthe  class  action  context  that  claims  based  on \ntemporary  conditions  may  continue  even  if  the \nputative named plaintiff’s claims become moot during \nthe  litigation.  The  government  is  therefore  incorrect \nthat  “claims  for  injunctive  relief”  related  to  the \nputative  class  are  moot.  Pet.  25.  This  Court  has \nrepeatedly  stated  that  a  class  action  remains  live  in \nvarious  circumstances  where  a  motion  for  class \ncertification  was  filed  prior  to  the  named  plaintiff’s \nclaim  becoming  moot.  See,  e.g.,  Cty.  of  Riverside  v. \nMcLaughlin,  500  U.S.  44,  52  (1991)  (“That  the  class \nwas  not  certified  until  after  the  named  plaintiffs’ \nclaims  had  become  moot  does  not  deprive  us  of \njurisdiction.”);  U.S.  Parole  Comm’n  v.  Geraghty,  445 \nU.S. 388, 398–99 (1980) (“named plaintiff may litigate \nthe class certification issue despite loss of his personal \nstake in the outcome of the litigation” when claims are \n“capable  of  repetition,  yet  evading  review,”  or \n“inherently  transitory”);  Swisher  v.  Brady,  438  U.S. \n204, 213 n.11 (1978); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, \n110 n.11 (1975); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402 n.11 \n(1975).   \n\nIn this case, Ms. Doe moved for class certification on \nOctober  18,  when  she  was  indisputably  a  member  of \nthe  putative  class.  And  the  primary  claim  on  which \nMs. Doe seeks to represent a class—the right to access \nabortion  services  while  in  U.S.  custody—is  the \narchetypal example of a claim that is both inherently \ntransitory  and  “capable  of  repetition  yet  evading \nreview.” See, e.g., Roe, 410 U.S. at 125; Doe v. Bolton, \n410 U.S. 179, 187 (1973); Doe v. Charleston Area Med. \nCtr.,  Inc.,  529  F.2d  638,  644  (4th  Cir.  1975); \nCiarpaglini  v.

Here,  Ms.  Doe  was \nnot  only  pregnant  but  also  in  federal  custody,  “[t]he \nlength of [which] . . . is impossible to predict.” Thorpe \nv.  Dist.  of  Columbia,  916  F.  Supp.  2d  65,  67  (D.D.C. \n2013); see also Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 399.  \n\nThe  government  argues  that  these  exceptions  to \nclass  action  mootness  cannot  apply  in  this  case \nbecause “[w]e simply do not know whether the district \ncourt  could  have  ruled  on  Ms.  Doe’s  motion  for  class \ncertification  before  her  interest  .  .  .  otherwise  would \nhave expired.” Pet. 26. But this is not the test. Instead, \ncourts look to the uncertainty surrounding the length \nof the condition as a general matter. See Geraghty, 445 \nU.S. at 399 (“It is by no means certain that any given \nindividual,  named  as  plaintiff,  would  be  in  [custody] \nlong  enough  for  a  district  judge  to  certify  the  class.” \n(emphasis added) (quoting Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 110, \nn.11));  Olson  v.  Brown,  594  F.3d  577,  582  (7th  Cir. \n2010)  (“it  is  uncertain  that  any  potential  named \nplaintiff in the class of inmates would have a live claim \nlong enough for a district court to certify a class”).   \n\nfor \n\nrequest \n\nThe  government’s \n\nthis  Court’s \nintervention should be rejected. Its argument that Ms. \nDoe’s claims for prospective relief regarding pregnant \nunaccompanied minors have been mooted is incorrect. \nThe  litigation  continues  below,  and  there  is  no \njustification  for  this Court  to  disrupt  that  process  by \nprematurely dismissing Ms. Doe’s legal claims.12 \n\n12 The petition does not, moreover, cite cases where this Court \nhas granted review in order to direct vacatur of an interlocutory \nruling in such a posture.",
        "21 \n\nIII.  VACATUR IS NOT WARRANTED. \n\nThe  government’s  asserted  rationale  for  vacatur  is \nequally unpersuasive. The petition seeks to vacate the \nD.C. Circuit’s decision to ensure that the ruling does \nnot “spawn[] any legal consequences.” Pet. 23 (quoting \nUnited States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 41 (1950)). \nEven if this rationale constituted sufficient grounds for \nthe  Court  to  grant  discretionary  review  and  vacate \n(and  the  government  agrees  it  does  not,  see  supra \nSection  I),  the  supposed  “legal  consequences”  are \nwholly  illusory.  No  purpose  would  be  served  by  the \nrelief  the  government  seeks.  The  D.C.  Circuit’s \ninterlocutory stay decision controls none of the issues \nbeing litigated. If and when the courts below reach the \nmerits  and  resolve  the  outstanding  issues,  the \ngovernment  will  have  a  full  opportunity  to  seek \nfurther review.   \n\nThe  government  points  to  Ms.  Doe’s  Bivens  claims \nand her putative class action as matters that it fears \nwill be “constrained” by the decision below. Pet. 23–24. \nThat  argument  might  carry  force  had  the  court  of \nappeals  actually  resolved  the  merits  of  any  issue \npresented  in  the  complaint.  But,  as  explained  above, \nthe  only  issue  before  the  court  of  appeals,  and  all  it \ndecided, was whether the defendants were entitled to \na  stay  pending  appeal.  Particularly  given  the \nsummary nature of its order, this interlocutory ruling \nwill  not  “constrain”  a  future  court  that  is  presented \nwith  the  merits  following  full  briefing.  See  18B \nCharles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal \nPractice  &  Procedure  §  4478.5,  at  797  (2d  ed.  2002) \n(“law of the case is not established by . . . denial of a \nstay . . . pending appeal”). Even rulings on preliminary \ninjunctive  relief  are  not  controlling  with  respect  to \nsubsequent  final  determinations  on  the  merits.  See \nUniv.  of  Tex.  v.  Camenisch,  451  U.S.  390,  394–95",
        "22 \n\n(1981); Berrigan v. Sigler, 499 F.2d 514, 518 (D.C. Cir. \n1974).  The  government  will  be  free  to  seek  both \nappellate  court  review  and  this  Court’s  review  when \nthe case reaches final judgment on the merits—which \nis  yet  another  reason  for  denying  the  petition.  See \nMount  Soledad  Mem’l  Ass’n  v.  Trunk,  567  U.S.  944 \n(2012) (Alito, J., concurring in denial of certiorari).   \n\nAt bottom, the government appears to be asking the \nCourt  for  a  do-over  in  light  of  its  failure  to  seek \nimmediate review of the court of appeals’ decision. But \nthat  is  a  problem  of  its  own  making,  and  it  fails  to \nidentify  any  reason  this  Court’s  resources  should  be \nexpended  reviewing  the  denial  of  an  emergency  stay \npending appeal. Seeking an immediate stay from this \nCourt when it was still timely to do so would have been \ncompletely  consistent  with  the  proceedings  in  this \ncase.13 Like Munsingwear itself, this is a case “where \nthe United States, having slept on its rights, now asks \nus to do what by orderly procedure it could have done \nfor itself.” 340 U.S. at 41. This Court should therefore \ndecline  to  vacate  the  decision  below.  See Mahoney  v. \nBabbitt,  113  F.3d  219,  221–22  (D.C.  Cir.  1997) \n(vacatur  of  preliminary  injunction  not  appropriate \nwhere government failed to seek a Supreme Court stay \nbefore  the  mooting  event  occurred  the  day  after  the \ninjunction). \n\n13 For instance, when the district court issued the initial TRO \non  October  18  at  3:17  p.m.,  the  government  filed  a  notice  of \nappeal, a motion for a stay pending appeal, and an administrative \nstay by 8:20 p.m. the same day. After the en banc court of appeals \nissued its October 24 order at 1:49 p.m., respondent’s counsel filed \na motion for an amended TRO at 3:04 p.m.",
        "23 \n\nIV.  THERE  IS  NO  BASIS  FOR  DISCIPLINARY \nRESPONDENT’S \n\nAGAINST \n\nACTION \nCOUNSEL. \n\nThe  government’s  concluding  suggestion  that  this \nCourt “may wish to issue an order to show cause why \ndisciplinary  action  should  not  be  taken”  against \nrespondent’s  counsel,  Pet.  26,  is  both  extraordinary \nand baseless. It finds no support in the facts or the law.   \n\nof,  and \n\nthe  availability \n\nThe government’s recitation of events shows that: (1) \nMs. Doe’s counsel made a series of accurate statements \nconcerning \nlogistics \nsurrounding,  Ms.  Doe’s  ability  to  obtain  an  abortion; \n(2) some government personnel may have incorrectly \nassumed  that  Ms.  Doe  could  not  obtain  an  abortion \nbefore October 26, even though she was legally entitled \nto  obtain  an  immediate  abortion,  and  had  received \nstate-mandated  counseling  on  October  19;  (3)  some \ngovernment lawyers may have believed that Ms. Doe’s \ncounsel  would  advise  them  if  facts  changed;  and  (4) \nMs.  Doe’s  counsel  did  not  take  affirmative  steps  to \nnotify  the  government  that  the  doctor  who  provided \nthe counseling on October 19 agreed to come back to \nthe  clinic.  The  government’s  suggestion  that  this \nmight  amount  to  sanctionable  misconduct  is  not \nsupported  by  legal  authorities  regarding  attorney \nconduct,  is  not  remotely  justified  by  the  disciplinary \ncases it cites,14 and is contrary to counsel’s respective \nethical duties. \n\n14 E.g.,  In  re  Hall,  57  S.  Ct.  107  (1936)  (disbarment  order \nrelated to In re Hall, 56 S. Ct. 86 (1935) (attorney special master \nabused appointment to coerce a litigant)); In re Davis, 289 U.S. \n704 (1933) (reprimand for failure to respond to communications \nfrom the clerk regarding outstanding fees); In re Gilbert, 276 U.S. \n294 (1928) (suspension for improperly retaining fees); In re Moore, \n177 F. Supp. 2d 197, 1998–99 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (explaining that In",
        "24 \n\nin \n\nthe  emails  or \n\nIn  an  effort  to  show  otherwise,  the  government \nrepeatedly claims that opposing counsel “represented” \n“that no abortion would take place until October 26,” \nPet.  11;  see  also  id.  at  13,  14,  19.  Yet  no  such \nrepresentation  appears \nthe \ndeclaration of the AUSA lodged with the Court by the \nSolicitor  General  that  the  government  cites.  Instead, \nthe  events  recited  in  the  petition  indicate  that  Ms. \nDoe’s  representatives  stated  at  various  times  on \nOctober 24 that the physician who was available at the \nclinic on October 24 (who was not the physician who \noriginally  provided  the  state-mandated  counseling) \ncould provide a new counseling session, which would \ntrigger a 24-hour waiting period. See 11/1/2017 AUSA \nDecl. ¶¶ 6–7. The government does not claim that any \nof these statements was false.  \n\nThe  government  also  points  to  statements  that \nrespondent’s  counsel  made  to  the  district  court  on \nOctober  24.  The  petition  states  that  respondent’s \ncounsel represented to the court “that for Ms. Doe to \nobtain an abortion, she would need to complete a two-\nstep, 24-hour process.” Pet. 12. But this misrepresents \ncounsel’s  filing.  Counsel  requested  an  amendment  to \nthe original TRO to make clear that its relief and the \ngovernment’s obligation to transport or allow Ms. Doe \nto be transported should be effective that very day. In \nsupport of this change, counsel noted that “a qualified \n\nre Disbarment of Moore, 529 U.S. 1127 (2000), involved a petition \nfor certiorari that failed to address the merits and accused lower \ncourt of corruption)); see also In re Shipley, 135 S. Ct. 1589, 1589–\n90  (2015)  (discharging  show  cause  order  regarding  Supreme \nCourt Rule 14.3 requirement that petitions for writs of certiorari \nbe  stated  “in  plain  terms,”  and  noting  that  attorneys  “may  not \ndelegate that responsibility to the client”); In re Sibley, 63 S. Ct. \n438  (1943)  (discharging  show  cause  order  without  identifying \nconduct at issue).",
        "25 \n\nphysician is available at the nearest clinic today, and \nwill be available to perform the procedure tomorrow.” \nPl.’s  Emergency  Mot.  to  Amend  the  TRO  2  (Oct.  24, \n2017).15 The motion specifically noted that it sought to \nensure  that  Ms.  Doe  could  “obtain  the  abortion  .  .  . \nwithout further delay and as may be required by Texas \nstate law and the availability of physicians.” Id. at 1 \n(emphases  added).  The  motion  thereby  made  clear \nthat  the  TRO  should  enable  Ms.  Doe  to  obtain  an \nabortion  at  the  earliest  time  and  from  any  available \nphysician. \n\nAs  this  motion  underscores,  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  did \nnot represent that, in making arrangements for her to \nsee the physician who was at the clinic on October 24, \nthey  were  forswearing  any  effort  to  secure  an \nappointment with any other doctor who might be able \nto  provide  the  abortion.  Indeed,  the  government \nknew—and  by  its  own  account  acknowledged  to  Ms. \nDoe’s representative on October 24—that the original \ndoctor  could  perform  the  procedure  without  the  need \nto repeat counseling. See 11/1/2017 AUSA Decl. ¶ 7.16 \n\n15 This  statement  was  not  only  true,  it  provided  new \ninformation;  as  of  oral  argument  on  October  20,  there  were  no \ndoctors scheduled to be at the clinic the week of October 23 after \nOctober  24.  D.C.  Cir.  Oral  Arg.  1:13:43–1:14:51,  https:// \nwww.cadc.uscourts.gov/recordings/recordings.nsf/DocsBy \nMonday?OpenView&StartKey=201710&Count=37&scode=3. \n\n16 The  AUSA’s  declaration  states  that,  in  response,  the \nattorney ad litem stated she was referring to “a different doctor” \nwho  could  perform  the  abortion  on  Thursday.  11/1/2017  AUSA \nDecl. ¶ 7. By the government’s own account, this statement was \nentirely accurate. The declaration indicates that the attorney ad \nlitem  was  talking  about  the  doctor  who  was  at  the  clinic  on \nOctober  24,  and  the  fact  that  new  arrangements  were  being \ncontemplated so that that doctor could remain at the clinic longer \nto provide the procedure. See id. ¶ 6.",
        "26 \n\nIt  also  knew  that  Ms.  Doe’s  representatives  were \nconsidering various logistical arrangements to ensure \nthat  a  doctor  would  be  available  to  provide  her \nabortion. Id. ¶ 6. These facts show that the situation \nwas fluid; Ms. Doe’s representatives were considering \nmultiple alternatives; and they were seeking to obtain \nMs.  Doe’s  long-delayed  abortion  as  soon  as  possible. \nThe  government  implies  that  it  reasonably  believed \nthese alternatives did not include any effort to return \nthe original doctor to the facility, and claims that Ms. \nDoe’s  attorney  ad  litem  had  stated  that  this  doctor \n“was not available,” Pet. 13. But this suggestion rests \non  yet  another  misleading  paraphrase:  According  to \nthe  government’s  own  declaration,  the  attorney  ad \nlitem stated that the original doctor “was not available \non  October  24.”  11/1/2017  AUSA  Decl.  ¶ 6  (emphasis \nadded).  The  government  does  not  claim  that  the \nstatement actually made was inaccurate, or that it was \na  representation  that  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  would  make \nno  effort  to  have  that  doctor  return to  the  facility  on \nOctober 25. \n\nThe government also points to a telephone call and \nexchanges  of  emails  on  October  24  in  an  effort  to \nsuggest that respondent’s counsel provided assurances \nthat  the  government  did  not  need  to  request  a  stay \nbecause the abortion would not occur until October 26. \nSpecifically, the government makes much of an email \nexchange in which one of its lawyers said the attorney \n“would appreciate it if [Ms. Doe’s counsel] could let me \nand [the AUSA] know when the timing for tomorrow’s \nprocedure  is  clarified,”  Pet’rs’  Ex.  F,  and  Ms.  Doe’s \ncounsel  stated  that  “[a]s  soon  as  we  understand  the \nclinic’s  schedule  tomorrow  we  will  let  you  know,” \nPet. 13.",
        "27 \n\n The government takes this exchange entirely out of \ncontext.  Less  than  an  hour  earlier,  the  shelter  had \nrefused to transport Ms. Doe to the clinic until it had \nORR’s approval, and the government had been advised \nthat  opposing  counsel  would  “initiate  contempt \nproceedings”  if  Ms.  Doe  was  not  transported  to  the \nclinic  promptly.  Pet’rs’  Ex.  C.  The  government \nattorney called respondent’s counsel shortly thereafter \nto  explain  that  the  shelter  needed  advance  notice  to \narrange  transportation,  and  to  confirm  that  Ms.  Doe \nwas now being transported to the clinic. See Pet. 12–\n13. The government attorney then sent the email that \nconfirmed  “[the  attorney’s]  understanding  that  the \nshelter  had  arranged  for  transport  services  this \nevening  per  your  email,”  and  included  the  attorney’s \nrequest \ntiming  of \n“tomorrow’s procedure.” Pet’rs’ Ex. F.  \n\ninformation  about \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nIn  context,  the  email  exchange  merely  documents \nthe government’s compliance with its obligation under \nthe TRO to provide transportation, its commitment to \ndo so again the following day, and counsel’s agreement \nto let the government know when Ms. Doe needed to \nbe  at  the  clinic  the  next  day  to  avoid  any  further \nproblems  with \nthe \ngovernment’s email does not mention any stay motion, \nlet alone link the request to the timing of such a filing. \nNor  does  the  government  claim  that  its  attorney \nmentioned any stay application in the earlier call. It is \nnow wishful thinking to argue that this exchange over \n\ntransportation.17  Critically, \n\nfor  pre-abortion  counseling.  The  request \n\n17 At  the  time  of  the  government’s  email,  Ms.  Doe  was  being \ntransported \nfor \ninformation about the timing of the next day’s “procedure” is thus \nsensibly understood as no more than a request to be informed of \nMs.  Doe’s  schedule  the  next  day  so  that  the  necessary \ntransportation could be arranged.",
        "28 \n\nreflects \n\nlogistics \n\ntransportation \na  mutual \nunderstanding  that  the  government  need  not  seek  a \nstay because opposing counsel “had represented to the \ngovernment that . . . no abortion would occur until the \nmorning of October 26,” Pet. 19. \n\nThe  government’s  claim  is  further  belied  by  the \nemail exchange the government points to from later in \nthe  evening  of  October  24.  The  government  asserts \nthat, “[b]ased on the representations of counsel that no \nabortion would occur until October 26,” it informed the \nClerk’s Office and respondent’s counsel that it would \nseek a stay the morning of October 25. Pet. 14. But by \nthe  government’s  own  account,  no  communication \nabout the timing of a motion for a stay occurred until \n8:13 p.m. the night of October 24 and, even then, the \nemail  the  government  sent  informing  respondent’s \ncounsel that it would seek a stay in the morning says \nnothing  about  any  such  representations.  Resp’ts’  \nEx.  1.  Nor  does  it  communicate  the  government’s \n“understanding” about the timing of the procedure or \nseek  confirmation  that  respondent’s  counsel  shared \nthat understanding, much less a commitment that her \ncounsel would promptly advise the government of any \nchanged circumstances. Id. The response from one of \nMs.  Doe’s \nincludes  no  such \nlikewise \nconfirmation  or  commitment.  Id.  Indeed,  one  of  her \nattorneys  responded  to  the  8:13 p.m.  email  by \nexpressing relief that he would not have to check his \nemail for any stay motion filed later that night. That \nemail indicates that Ms. Doe’s attorneys had expected \nthe  government  to  seek  a  stay  that  night—an \nexpectation wholly inconsistent with the government’s \nsuggestion  that  there  was  a  mutual  understanding \nthat filing was unnecessary because Ms. Doe’s counsel \n\nlawyers",
        "29 \n\nhas  represented  that  the  abortion  would  not  occur \nuntil October 26.  \n\nThe Solicitor General argues that these statements \nand  events  of  October  24  led  some  government \npersonnel to assume that Ms. Doe would not be able to \nobtain an abortion prior to October 26. See Letter from \nNoel J. Francisco, Solicitor General, to David D. Cole, \nNational  Legal  Director,  ACLU  2  (Oct.  26,  2017) \n(stating that it relied on representations of counsel and \nothers  and  “our  resulting  understanding  that  no \nabortion  procedure  could  then  take  place”  until \nOctober  26)  (emphasis  added)).  But  none  of  the \nstatements the government cites was a representation, \nmuch less a commitment, “that no abortion would take \nplace until October 26,” Pet. 11. \n\nThe  petition  describes  a  course  of  events  where \nmany  different  parties  were  communicating  into  the \nnight  as  events  unfolded  rapidly.  Particularly  given \nthis  fluid  situation,  and  the  government’s  knowledge \nthat Ms. Doe had sought throughout the litigation to \nobtain  an  abortion  as  soon  as  possible,  it  is  striking \nthat  government  counsel,  by  the  government’s  own \naccount, neither requested that Ms. Doe forbear from \nobtaining the procedure while the government sought \na  stay  from  this  Court  nor  sought  confirmation  of \ngovernment \nthat  no \nabortion would occur prior to October 26. Absent such \na commitment or confirmation, it was incumbent upon \ngovernment  counsel  immediately  to  seek  a  stay.  The \ngovernment cannot now blame opposing counsel for its \nown failure either to act with its customary alacrity or \nto take any protective steps. \n\n“understanding” \n\ncounsel’s \n\nIn short, Ms. Doe’s counsel had made clear that they \nwere  attempting  to  help  their  client  obtain  the",
        "30 \n\nabortion as soon as possible; the government knew Ms. \nDoe had already received counseling from the original \ndoctor,  so  that  if  that  doctor  became  available,  the \nabortion could take place immediately; and according \nto the government’s own recitation of events, it did not \nlink its request for information about the timing of Ms. \nDoe’s appointment on October 25 with any statement \nconcerning the timing of a stay motion with this Court.  \n\nTo suggest that respondent’s counsel had a duty to \nforbear from effectuating the TRO on October 25 under \nthese facts would turn counsel’s ethical obligations on \ntheir head. The only reason Ms. Doe’s representatives \nneeded to talk to government personnel at all was to \ntell them the timing of Ms. Doe’s appointment so that \nthe  government  would  not  delay  Ms.  Doe’s \ntransportation  to  the  clinic.  If  government  counsel \nwished to ensure that they would have an opportunity \nto seek a stay before the abortion procedure, they could \nand  should  have  requested  such  an  assurance  from \nrespondent’s  counsel  and,  if  they  did  not  receive  a \nsufficiently clear commitment, they could and should \nhave immediately sought relief from this Court. They \ninexplicably failed to take these reasonable steps, and \ncannot  now  blame  respondent’s  counsel  for  the \nconsequences of their own inaction.  \n\nIn addition to failing to supply a factual basis for its \nextraordinary request, the government fails to supply \na specific legal rationale or cite to any legal authority \nthat supports its position. The petition vaguely refers \nto “what appear to be material misrepresentations and \nomissions”  by  respondent’s  counsel,  Pet.  26,  a  claim \nthat,  if  true,  would  violate  ethical  rules.  See  ABA, \nModel  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  R. 3.3  (2016) \n(prohibiting  knowingly  false  statement  of  fact  to  a \ntribunal);  id.  R. 4.1(a)  (barring  “a  false  statement  of",
        "31 \n\nmaterial fact or law to a third person”); id. R. 4.1 cmt. 1 \n(misrepresentations).  But  the  government  identifies \nno  misrepresentations  and  fails  to  explain  how \ncounsels’  statements  and/or  actions  would  have \namounted to false statements. The petition says that \nrespondent’s  counsel  “arguably”  had  an  obligation  to \nnotify  the  government  that  Ms.  Doe’s  original \nphysician  had  become  available  on  the  morning  of \nOctober 25. Pet. 28. Yet the petition cites to no rule of \nethics, case law, or other authority to support such an \nobligation. Indeed, no such obligation exists—and for \nsensible  reasons.  A \nlawyer  “generally  has  no \naffirmative  duty  to  inform  an  opposing  party  of \nrelevant facts,” except “when disclosure is necessary to \navoid  assisting  a  criminal  or  fraudulent  act  by  a \nclient.” ABA, supra, R. 4.1 & cmt. 1; see id. cmt. 3. A \nlawyer  has  an  “obligation  zealously  to  protect  and \npursue  a  client’s  legitimate  interests,  within  the \nbounds  of  the  law,”  id.  pmbl.,  and  violates  that  duty \n“when he or she . . . fails to take the necessary steps to \npreserve  the client’s interests,”  In  re  Bernstein,  707 \nA.2d  371,  376  (D.C.  1998),  or  to  maintain  client \nconfidentiality,  see  In  re  Gonzalez,  773  A.2d  1026, \n1030–31  (D.C.  2001).18  The  events  the  government \nrecites  show  that  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  acted  in  their \nclient’s best interests, which is precisely what counsel \nare  supposed  to  do.  The  government’s  extraordinary \n\n18 Far  from  requiring  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  to  apprise  the \ngovernment  of  the  details  of  Ms.  Doe’s  medical  appointments, \nethics rules would have precluded them from agreeing to do so if \nit would undermine her interests.

After  receiving  a  medical \nexamination  and  being  informed  she  was  pregnant, \nMs. Doe told shelter staff that she wanted an abortion. \nWith the help of two court-appointed representatives, \nshe  received  permission  from  a  Texas  state  court  to \nbypass the State’s parental consent law and to consent \nto  the  abortion  herself.  She  then  sought  to  attend \nstate-mandated  pre-abortion  counseling  at  a  local \nclinic. Pursuant to a policy adopted in March 2017 by \nthe  Director  of  the  Office  of  Refugee  Resettlement \n(ORR) at the U.S. Department of Health and Human \nServices (HHS)—and in stark contrast to the policies \nof U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) \nand  the  Bureau  of  Prisons  (BOP)—the  government \nrefused  to  allow  Ms.  Doe  to  attend  any  abortion-\nrelated appointments.  \n\nMs. Doe brought suit in federal district court seeking \nto enforce her right to an abortion, consistent with the \nConstitution  and  the  state  court’s  order.  The \ngovernment  did  not  contest  Ms.  Doe’s  claim  that  she \nhas  a  constitutional  right  to  an  abortion.  Nor  did  it \nargue  that  allowing  her  to  attend  the  appointments \nwould  violate  statutory  restrictions  on  the  use  of \nfederal  funds  or  any  federal  regulations.  Instead,  it \nargued that it should not have to “facilitate” her access \nto an abortion—even if it did not pay for, or transport \nMs.  Doe  to,  any  appointments.  Because  she  was  in \nfederal  custody,  this  policy  prevented  Ms.  Doe  from \n\n1 Respondent Garza is Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem. \n\n \n \n                                                      \n\f2 \n\nexercising what the government did not contest is her \nconstitutional right.    \n\nOn  October  18,  2017,  the  district  court  issued  a \ntemporary restraining order (TRO) that, among other \nthings,  directed  the  defendants  to  allow  Ms.  Doe  to \nattend the necessary appointments. The same day, the \ngovernment  sought  an  emergency  stay  pending \nappeal,  which  a  panel  of  the  D.C.  Circuit  granted  in \npart on October 20. On October 24, however, the D.C. \nCircuit  en  banc  granted  rehearing  and  denied  the \ngovernment’s emergency request for a stay. This time, \nthe government did not seek an immediate stay, even \nthough nothing precluded it from doing so. On the next \nday,  October  25,  one  month  after  the  state  court \nauthorized Ms. Doe to obtain an abortion, she finally \nhad the procedure.  \n\nHaving  failed  to  seek  an  emergency  stay  from  this \nCourt on October 24, as it had from the D.C. Circuit on \nthe  day  the  district  court  granted  the  TRO,  the \ngovernment  filed  this  petition  nine  days  after  the \nevents that it claims have rendered the issues in this \ncase moot. The government does not seek review of the \nsingle  legal  issue  decided  by  the  court  of  appeals—\nwhether  the  government’s  application  for  a  stay \npending appeal met the standards for obtaining such \nrelief.  Rather,  it  asks  this  Court  to  vacate  that \nemergency,  interlocutory  ruling  on  the  ground  that \nsome of Ms. Doe’s claims for relief have been mooted \nby  her  abortion.  The  government  then  suggests  that \nthis  Court  should  decide,  in  the  first  instance,  that \nclaims Ms. Doe seeks to bring on behalf of herself and \na class are likewise moot and dismiss those claims now \nwhile \nin  district  court. \nSimultaneously,  the  government  suggests  that  this \nCourt should consider issuing an order to show cause \n\nthey  remain  pending \n\n \n\f3 \n\nwhy  disciplinary  action  should  not  be  taken  against \nrespondent’s  counsel  “in  light  of  the  extraordinary \ncircumstances of this case.” Pet. 26.  \n\nit \n\nit \n\nof \n\nBut \n\nreview; \n\nis  the  government’s  petition  that \n\nis \nextraordinary:  The  government  asks  this  Court  to \ngrant  certiorari  without  identifying  any  question \nworthy \nseeks  vacatur  under \ncircumstances  that  the  government  has  repeatedly \nargued  do  not  warrant  this  Court’s  intervention;  it \nasks this Court to direct dismissal of an array of claims \nnot implicated by the decision below before any lower \ncourt  has  passed  on  them;  and  it  suggests  that  this \nCourt consider disciplinary action against lawyers for \nfaithfully fulfilling their ethical duties to their client.  \n\nThe  petition  should  be  denied  for  at  least  three \nreasons. First, as the government acknowledges, even \nwhere a case has become moot, the Court should not \ngrant  review  for  purposes  of  vacating a lower  court’s \ndecision unless the petition independently presents an \nissue that would have been worthy of review prior to \nbecoming moot. Yet the government identifies no such \nissue.  The  only  question  decided  below  was  whether \nthe government had met the requirements for a stay \nof  a  TRO  pending  appeal.  That  narrow,  fact-bound \nissue, as to which the court of appeals applied the legal \nstandard urged by both sides, is not remotely worthy \nof  this  Court’s  review.  No  other  issues  are  presented \nbecause the court below did not decide any.   \n\nSecond, even if the decision below presented an issue \nworthy  of  this  Court’s  review,  the  relief  the \ngovernment  seeks  would  not  be  warranted.  The \ngovernment’s argument that this Court should vacate \nthe  decision  below  and  direct  the  dismissal  of  all \nclaims  for  prospective  relief  regarding  pregnant \n\n \n\f4 \n\nunaccompanied  minors  on  the  grounds  that  they  are \nmoot  is  erroneous.  The  claims  in  this  case  regarding \nthe treatment of pregnant minors are currently being \nlitigated in the district court, and finding that they are \nmoot  would  contravene \nthis  Court’s  decisions \nrecognizing  exceptions  to  mootness  in  cases  like  this \none where the factual basis for the claim is of a fleeting \nnature.   \n\nThird, vacatur is intended to protect parties who are \nprevented from appealing and who would be harmed \nby  the  binding  effects  of  the  mooted  ruling  on  future \nlitigation.  In  this  case,  however,  and  consistent  with \nestablished  law,  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  interlocutory \ndecision  denying  a  stay  has  no  preclusive  effect  on \nfuture  litigation.  Moreover,  the  government  failed  to \ntake  the  steps  necessary  to  preserve  its  appellate \nrights, and in all events retains a full opportunity to \nseek  review  of  the  future  litigation  following  final \njudgment on those claims.  \n\nFinally, the government’s suggestion that this Court \nshould  consider  issuing  an  order  to  show  cause  why \nrespondent’s  counsel  should  not  be  disciplined \nprovides  no  basis  to  find  that  counsel’s  conduct \npresents grounds for concern, much less sanction. The \npetition does not present legal or factual grounds  for \nits  suggestion  that  respondent’s  counsel  may  have \nviolated any applicable rule of professional conduct. To \nthe  contrary,  the  government’s  recitation  of  events \nshows that it failed to seek a stay from this Court in a \ntimely  manner  based  on  assumptions  it  made  about \nthe timing of Ms. Doe’s procedure, not on the basis of \nany commitments from Ms. Doe’s lawyers. \n\n \n\f5 \n\nCOUNTERSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nA.  Facts \n\nIn early September 2017, Jane Doe, a young woman \nof 17, entered the United States without her parents. \nShe was apprehended by U.S. authorities and placed \nin  HHS  custody  in  a  shelter  run  by  a  federal \ngovernment  grantee  in  Texas.  Through  ORR,  HHS \nexercises its responsibility for the “care and custody of \nall  unaccompanied \nincluding \nalien \nresponsibility for their detention, where appropriate.” \n8 U.S.C. § 1232(b)(1).  A  nationwide  consent  decree \nrequires ORR and its shelters to provide “appropriate \nroutine medical . . . care, family planning services, and \nemergency  health \nservices.”  Stipulated \nSettlement  Agreement,  Ex.  1  at  1,  Flores  v.  Reno,  \nNo. CV-85-4544 (C.D. Cal. Jan. 17, 1997). \n\nchildren, \n\ncare \n\nletter \n\ninforming  grantees  of \n\nOn March 4, 2017, the Acting Director of ORR issued \na \nits  policy  of \n“prohibit[ing]  [shelters]  from  taking  any  action  that \nfacilitates an abortion without direction and approval \nfrom  the  Director  of  ORR,”  D.D.C.  Dkt.  No.  3-5,  a \npolicy  that  effectively  gives  the  ORR  Director  veto \npower over a young woman’s abortion decision. \n\nOnce in HHS custody, Ms. Doe was given a medical \nexamination  and  told  that  she  was  pregnant. \n10/17/2017  White  Decl.  ¶  7.  She  informed  her \ncustodians  that  she  wished  to  terminate  the \npregnancy. Id. ¶ 8. ORR directed the shelter to inform \nMs.  Doe’s  mother  of  her  pregnancy  over  Ms.  Doe’s \nobjection.  Appellee’s  Opp.  to  Mot.  for  Stay  Pending \nAppeal  7  (Oct.  19,  2017).  The  government  also \nrequired Ms. Doe to attend a counseling session at an \nanti-abortion  center.  10/13/2017  Amiri  Decl.  ¶  2; \n10/11/2017 Doe Decl. ¶ 13. \n\n \n\f6 \n\nTo  obtain  an  abortion  under  Texas  law,  a  minor \nmust obtain parental consent or a court order finding \nthat  she  “is  mature  and  sufficiently  well informed  to \nmake the decision” on her own, or that “the notification \nand attempt to obtain consent would not be in the best \ninterest  of  the  minor.”  Tex.  Fam.  Code  Ann. \n§ 33.003(i)(1)–(2). A state court appointed a guardian \nad  litem  and  an  attorney  ad  litem  for  Ms.  Doe  and, \nwith  their  assistance,  she  received  a  court  order  on \nSeptember 25 granting her authority to consent to an \nabortion  without  the  knowledge  or  consent  of  her \nparents or legal guardian. Pet. App. 69a.  \n\nUnder  Texas  law,  Ms.  Doe  first  had  to  attend \ncounseling at least 24 hours in advance of the abortion \nwith the physician who would perform the procedure. \nPet. App. 70a. When Ms. Doe requested permission to \nattend that counseling on September 27, ORR refused. \n10/17/2017 White Decl. ¶ 10.2  \n\nORR  took  this  position  notwithstanding  contrary \nICE  and  BOP  policies  that  allow  detained  women  to \nobtain  abortions,  and  despite  the  government’s \nposition in this case that Ms. Doe would have been free \nto have an abortion if ORR placed her with a sponsor, \nsee  Appellants’  Emergency  Mot.  for  Stay  Pending \nAppeal 11 (Oct. 18, 2017). \n\nB.  Procedural History \n\nOn  October  13,  2017,  Ms.  Doe’s  guardian  ad  litem \nfiled suit in the U.S. District Court for the District of \nColumbia  against  the  Acting  Secretary  of  HHS  and \n\n2 In response, Ms. Doe filed a lawsuit in Texas state court on \nOctober 5, alleging state-law neglect by the shelter. That case is \nsealed and has been removed to federal court. Appellee’s Opp. to \nMot. for Stay Pending Appeal 10 n.6 (Oct. 19, 2017).  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f7 \n\nother department officials on behalf of Ms. Doe and a \nputative  class  of  “all  other  pregnant  unaccompanied \nin  ORR  custody  nationwide, \nimmigrant  minors \nincluding those who will become pregnant during the \npendency of this lawsuit,” Compl. ¶ 47. The complaint \nalleges,  among  other  things,  that  the  defendants \nviolated  the  Constitution  by  “obstructing,  interfering \nwith, or blocking [the minors’] access to abortion” and \nby  revealing \n[the  minors’] \n“information  about \npregnancy  and  abortions  to  their  parents  or  other \nfamily members, including immigration sponsors.” Id. \n¶¶ 55–56.  Respondent  simultaneously  sought  a  TRO \nto  prevent  the  government  “from  obstructing  [Ms. \nDoe’s]  access  to  abortion.”  Id.  at  15.  On  October  18, \nrespondent moved for class certification.  \n\nThe district court granted a TRO later on October 18, \nrequiring defendants either to transport Ms. Doe or to \nallow  her  to be  transported  “to  the  abortion  provider \nclosest to [the] shelter in order to obtain the counseling \nrequired  by  state  law  on  October  19,  2017,  and  to \nobtain  the  abortion  procedure  on  October  20,  2017 \nand/or  October  21,  2017,  as  dictated  by  the  abortion \nproviders’ availability and any medical requirements.” \nPet  App.  73a.  It  also  temporarily  restrained  the \ndefendants  from  “further  forcing  [Ms.  Doe]  to  reveal \nher  abortion  decision  to  anyone,  or  revealing  it  to \nanyone themselves” or from retaliating against her or \nthe  shelter.  Id.  at  74a.  Within  five  hours  that  same \nday, the government not only filed a notice of appeal \nin the D.C. Circuit, but also an emergency motion for \na stay pending appeal, and a request for a temporary \nadministrative  stay  while  the  court  considered  the \nstay pending appeal. Pet. 8.  \n\nOn  October  19,  a  panel  of  the  D.C.  Circuit \nadministratively  stayed  the  TRO  to  the  extent  it \n\n \n\f8 \n\npertained  to  Ms.  Doe’s  transportation  to  obtain  an \nabortion  on  October  20  or  21.  Order  (Oct.  19,  2017). \nThe  court  did  not  stay  other  parts  of  the  TRO, \nincluding  the  portion  relating  to  the  counseling \nappointment on October 19. Id. Ms. Doe received state-\nmandated counseling on October 19. Pet. 11. \n\nFollowing  oral  argument,  the  panel  issued  a  per \ncuriam decision on October 20 in which it vacated the \nportion  of  the  TRO  that  required  the  defendants  to \ntransport Ms. Doe to either counseling or an abortion. \nThe  panel  noted  that  the  government  “has  assumed, \nfor purposes of this case, that [Ms. Doe] . . . possesses \na  constitutional  right  to  obtain  an  abortion  in  the \nUnited States.” Pet. App. 2a–3a. The panel found that \nreleasing Ms. Doe to a sponsor, which the government \nstated  it  was  attempting  to  do,  “does  not  unduly \nburden  the  minor’s  right  under  Supreme  Court \nprecedent to an abortion . . . . so long as the process of \nsecuring  a  sponsor  to  whom  the  minor  is  released \noccurs expeditiously.” Id. at 2a (emphasis added). The \ncourt  therefore  remanded  to  the  district  court  with \ninstructions  to  allow  HHS  eleven  more  days—until \n5:00  p.m.  on  October  31—to  secure  a  sponsor  and \nrelease  Ms.  Doe.  If  no  sponsor  was  approved  in  that \ntime, the order provided that Ms. Doe could seek a new \nTRO  “or  other  appropriate  order,”  which  the \ngovernment “may . . . immediately appeal.” Id.  \n\nJudge Millett dissented. She pointed out that there \nwas  no  “factual  basis  to  think  that  remand  will \naccomplish anything but a forced continuation” of Ms. \nDoe’s  pregnancy,  given  the  government’s  failure  to \nidentify a sponsor after six weeks. Pet App. 13a. Judge \nMillett observed, moreover, that the vetting process for \nrigorous”  and \n“understandably \nsponsors  was \ncontrolled  by  HHS.  Id.  On  the  other  side  of  the \n\n \n\f9 \n\nbalance, Judge Millett wrote, “[e]very day that goes by \nis another day that the federal government forces [Ms. \nDoe]  to  carry  an  unwanted  pregnancy  forward.  Days \nalso  increase  the  health  risks  associated  with  an \nabortion  procedure . . . .  [I]f  [she]  is  17  or  18  weeks \nalong by the time this issue is resolved, the doctors at \nthe South Texas clinic nearest to her (assuming it still \nhas  availability)  will  likely  no  longer  be  willing  to \nperform the procedure.” Id. at 14a. \n\nOn Sunday, October 22, Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem \nfiled  an  emergency  petition  for  rehearing  en  banc  in \nthe D.C. Circuit. Shortly before 2 p.m. Central Time3 \non  October  24,  the  D.C.  Circuit  en  banc  granted  the \npetition  for  rehearing  and  denied  the  government’s \nmotion for a stay pending appeal. The court concluded \nthat  the  government  had  “not  met  the  stringent \nrequirements for a stay pending appeal, substantially \nfor  the  reasons”  set  forth  in  Judge  Millett’s  dissent \nfrom  the  panel  decision.  Pet.  App.  19a  (citation \nomitted). At this point in time, the government could \nhave immediately sought a stay from this Court,4 just \nas it had immediately sought a stay from the court of \nappeals when the district court entered the TRO. But \nit chose not to.  \n\nFollowing  the  D.C.  Circuit’s  decision,  Ms.  Doe’s \nguardian ad litem filed an emergency motion to amend \nthe TRO in the district court. Pet. 10. The district court \ngranted the motion shortly after 4 p.m. on October 24 \nand  issued  an  amended  TRO  that  required  the \ndefendants  to  transport  Ms.  Doe,  or  allow  her  to  be \ntransported,  “promptly  and  without  delay,  on  such \n\n3 All times listed in this brief reflect Central Time. \n\n4 See Sup.

App.  66a.  Again,  the  government  could  have \nsought a stay from this Court at this point, but did not.  \n\nC.  Post-TRO Events  \n\nUpon receiving the amended TRO at about 4:15 p.m., \nMs.  Doe’s  guardian  ad  litem  emailed  shelter  and \nDepartment  of  Justice  (DOJ)  personnel  requesting \nthat they transport Ms. Doe to the clinic. Pet’rs’ Ex. B.5 \nDespite the court order, the shelter responded that it \nwould have to wait for ORR instructions. Pet’rs’ Ex. M \nat  7.  In  response,  Ms.  Doe’s  attorney  attached  the \ncourt’s  order  and  advised  the  shelter  that  she  would \ninitiate contempt proceedings if the government defied \nthe order. Pet’rs’ Ex. C.  \n\nSoon  thereafter,  a  DOJ  attorney  called  Ms.  Doe’s \nattorney  to \ninform  her  that  the  shelter  was \ntransporting  Ms.  Doe.  The  DOJ  attorney  explained \nthat the shelter needed advance notice “of the timing \nof  any  appointments,”  Pet.  13.  At  5:26  p.m., \ngovernment  counsel  emailed  Ms.  Doe’s  attorney  to \nthank  her  for  speaking  earlier  and  “to  confirm  [the \nattorney’s]  understanding  that  the  shelter  had \n\n5 The government proposes to lodge with the Court under seal \nexhibits  of  non-record  material.  Respondent’s  counsel  has \ninformed the Court that it has agreed with the government that \nit  may  utilize  these  exhibits  in  this  brief,  and  seek  to  lodge  its \nown,  while  protecting  sensitive  information  and  individuals’ \nconfidentiality.  Respondent  will  seek  to  make  these  materials \npublic with appropriate redactions.  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f11 \n\narranged for transport services this evening per your \nemail.”  Pet’rs’  Ex.  F.  Government  counsel  continued: \n“I  would  appreciate  it  if  you  could  let  me  and  [the \nAssistant U.S. Attorney (AUSA) in Texas] know when \nthe  timing  for  tomorrow’s  procedure  is  clarified.”  Id. \nMs. Doe’s attorney replied minutes later stating that \nshe  appreciated  the  call,  and  that  “[a]s  soon  as  we \nunderstand the clinic’s schedule tomorrow we will let \nyou know.” Pet. 13.  \n\nShortly  after  6:00  p.m.,  shelter  personnel  emailed \nHHS  and  DOJ  personnel  that  Ms.  Doe’s  attorney  ad \nlitem  had  informed  them  that  “‘the  window  for \nappointment this evening was missed,’” and Ms. Doe \nshould return to the shelter. Pet’rs’ Ex. E.  \n\nAt  6:17  p.m.,  Ms.  Doe’s  attorney  emailed  DOJ \nattorneys to say that the doctor was unable to stay that \nevening,  and  that  “[t]he  ad  litems  will  arrange  with \nthe  shelter  to  have  [Ms.  Doe]  arrive  at  the  clinic  at  \n7:30  a.m.”  the  next  morning.  Pet’rs’  Ex.  F.  A  few \nminutes  later,  Ms.  Doe’s  guardian  informed  shelter \nand DOJ personnel that Ms. Doe “has an appointment \ntomorrow morning at 7:30 a.m.” at the clinic and “must \nbe there on time.” Pet’rs’ Ex. G. The shelter confirmed \nthat it would make “necessary arrangements to ensure \nminor is present.” Pet’rs’ Ex. H.   \n\nAt  8:13  p.m.,  another  DOJ  attorney  emailed  Ms. \nDoe’s attorneys to say that DOJ intended to seek a stay \nfrom  the  Supreme  Court  the  next  morning.  Resp’ts’ \nEx. 1.  One  of  Ms.  Doe’s  attorneys  emailed  back  to \nthank the attorney for letting him know. Id. \n\nAt 9:31 p.m., Ms. Doe’s guardian ad litem informed \nshelter  and  DOJ  personnel \nthat  Ms.  Doe’s \n“appointment  has  been  moved  to  4:15  a.m.  at  the \naddress  provided.”  Pet’rs’  Ex.  K.  The  shelter  again \n\n \n\f12 \n\nindicated \n\nconfirmed  receipt  and \nit  had  made \ntransportation  arrangements.  Pet’rs’  Ex.  L.  Shelter \npersonnel  forwarded  the  email  to  HHS  personnel  at \n11:56 p.m.  to  inform  them  that  it  had  “not  received \nconfirmation of what service will take place tomorrow, \nwe were under the impression [Ms. Doe] was going in \nfor  mandated  counseling,  however,  provided  newly \nrequested  time  was  issued  at  the  request  of  health \ncenter and attending physician, it is unclear whether \n[Ms.  Doe]  will  partake  in  mandated  counseling  or \nundergo medical procedure.” Pet’rs’ Ex. M at 3.   \n\nAt  4:30  a.m.  on  Wednesday,  October  25,  shelter \npersonnel  emailed  HHS  personnel  stating  that  the \n“health center charge nurse has confirmed that minor \nis  scheduled  to  undergo  medical  procedure  this \nmorning.” Id. at 1 (emphasis added).  \n\nAfter  8  a.m.  that  morning,  Ms.  Doe’s  abortion  was \nperformed by the doctor who had originally counseled \nher on October 19. In response to DOJ inquiries, Ms. \nDoe’s  attorney  confirmed  this  fact  in  an  email  at  \n9:00 a.m. Pet. 15.   \n\nAlthough the petition states that at the time Ms. Doe \nhad her abortion the government “believed that it had \nidentified  a  potentially  suitable  sponsor,”  and \n“believed that the process could be completed within a \nweek,” id. at 6, it is now more than a month later, and \nthe government still has not approved a sponsor; Ms. \nDoe remains in ORR custody. Had it not been for court \nintervention, Ms. Doe would still be pregnant, against \nher will, today. \n\n \n\f13 \n\nREASONS FOR DENYING THE PETITION \n\nI.  THE  DECISION  BELOW  DOES  NOT \nPRESENT  A  LEGAL  ISSUE  WORTHY  OF \nTHIS COURT’S REVIEW. \n\nHaving failed to seek a timely stay, the government \nnow asks the Court to grant review of an interlocutory \norder  that  it  contends  is  moot.  By  the  government’s \nown  reasoning,  the  underlying  decision  presents  no \nmerits issues on which the Court could rule, even if it \nwere  so  inclined.  Instead,  the  government  asks  the \nCourt  to  grant  review  to  vacate  the  D.C.  Circuit’s \ndecision, a form of relief this Court has described as an \n“extraordinary  remedy,”  U.S.  Bancorp  Mortg.  Co.  v. \nBonner Mall P’ship, 513 U.S. 18, 26 (1994).   \n\nTo  succeed  in  this  unusual  plea,  the  government \nmust—consistent  with  its  own  longstanding  view—\ndemonstrate that the case would have independently \nwarranted  this  Court’s  review  had  it  not  become  (in \nthe government’s view) moot. See Pet. 23 n.4. It “has \nbeen the consistent position of the United States” that \n“the Court should deny review of cases (or claims) that \nhave  become  moot  after  the  court  of  appeals  entered \nits  judgment  but  before  this  Court  has  acted  on  the \npetition,  when  such  cases  (or  claims)  do  not  present \nany  question  that  would  independently  be  worthy  of \nthis Court’s review.” U.S. Amicus Br. at 10, McFarling \nv.  Monsanto  Co.,  545  U.S.  1139  (2005)  (No.  04-31) \n(cert.  denied);  see  U.S.  Br.  in  Opp.  at  5–8,  Velsicol \nChem. Corp. v. United States, 435 U.S. 942 (1978) (No. \n77-900)  (cert.  denied);  Stephen  M.  Shapiro  et  al., \nSupreme  Court  Practice §  19.4,  at  968  n.33  (10th  ed. \n2013)  (noting  that  the  Court  appears  to  follow  the \ngovernment’s approach). This rule recognizes that this \n“discretionary  and  exercised \nCourt’s  review \n\nis \n\n \n\f14 \n\ncircumspectly,”  and  that  “there  is  no  unfairness  in \nleaving  the  lower  court’s  decision  intact”  where  “the \nCourt would have denied certiorari in any event.” U.S. \nBr.  in  Opp.  at  12–13,  Enron  Power  Mktg.,  Inc.  v.  N. \nStates  Power  Co.,  528  U.S.  1182  (2000)  (No.  99-916) \n(cert.  denied);  id.  at  11  (agreeing  that  the  decision \nbelow  was  incorrect  but  urging  denial  in  light  of  the \ngovernment’s longstanding position). \n\nThe government plainly cannot meet its own test. In \nfact, the petition barely presents any affirmative legal \nargument that the D.C. Circuit’s decision would have \nwarranted this Court’s review if the government had \nsought  review  on  the  merits.  It  does  not  directly \nclaim—because  it  cannot—that  the  court  of  appeals’ \ndecision  denying  a  stay  conflicts  with  any  other \ncircuit’s decision, or with a prior decision of this Court. \nSee  Sup.  Ct.  R.  10.  Instead,  the  petition  contains  a \nsingle sentence that merely notes that prior decisions \nof  this  Court  support  the  view  that  “the  government \ngenerally  need  not  facilitate  abortions.”  Pet.  22 \n(emphasis added).  \n\nThe lower court did not, however, resolve the merits \nof Ms. Doe’s constitutional claim or the government’s \nargument  that  its  refusal  to  “facilitate”  Ms.  Doe’s \nabortion  did  not  impose  an  unconstitutional  “undue \nburden” on Ms. Doe.6 The only matter decided below—\nand  therefore  the  only  question  the  government’s \npetition  could  have  presented—was  whether  the \ngovernment’s emergency motion for a stay of the TRO \npending  appeal  should  be  denied  because  the \n\n6 Because the government did not dispute below that Ms. Doe \nhas a constitutional right to an abortion, it does not and could not \nappropriately raise that issue here. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f15 \n\ngovernment had “not met the stringent requirements” \nfor such relief. Pet. App. 19a.  \n\nThat narrow question is manifestly unworthy of this \nCourt’s review. Indeed, the government does not claim \notherwise.  Nor  does  it  raise  that  legal  issue  for  this \nCourt’s consideration. See Pet. I. And for good reason. \nThe test for a stay pending appeal is highly fact-bound \nand inherently individualized. See Nken v. Holder, 556 \nU.S.  418,  426  (2009)  (court  weighs  multiple  factors: \napplicant’s likelihood of success on the merits, whether \napplicant  will  suffer  irreparable  injury,  balance  of \nhardships, and public interest).7 The petition does not \nargue  that  the  court  of  appeals  applied  the  incorrect \nlegal  test.  And  review  of  the  court  of  appeals’ \napplication of Nken to the facts here is plainly not the \nstuff of certiorari. See Sup. Ct. R. 10; c.f., U.S. Br. in \nOpp. at 8, Walmer v. Dep’t of Def., 516 U.S. 974 (1995) \n(No. 95-230) (cert. denied) (urging denial of review of \npreliminary injunction ruling where the only question \nproperly presented is the application of the established \nstandard to “case-specific” facts). \n\nEven  if  the  court  of  appeals  had  ruled  on  the \nconstitutionality of the government’s actions—and in \nmerely denying a stay pending appeal it manifestly did \nnot—such a decision would not conflict with any of the \ncases the government cites. In those cases, the Court \nactions  were \nfound \nconstitutional  because  they  “place[d]  no  obstacles—\nabsolute or otherwise—in the pregnant woman’s path \nto  an  abortion.”  Harris  v.  McRae,  448  U.S.  297,  314 \n(1980)  (quoting  Maher  v.  Roe,  432  U.S.  464,  474 \n\ngovernment’s \n\nthat \n\nthe \n\n7 In addition to being only one of several factors, likelihood of \nsuccess on the merits is not a determination on the merits.  See \nUniv. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 394 (1981). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f16 \n\n(1977));  Webster  v.  Reproductive  Health  Servs.,  492 \nU.S.  490,  509 \n(1989);  see  generally  Planned \nParenthood  of  Se.  Pa.  v.  Casey,  505  U.S.  833,  876 \n(1992) (undue burden standard). Because Ms. Doe was \n(and still is) in U.S. custody, the government’s refusal \nto permit her to attend her appointments places her in \na wholly different position.   \n\n  The  petition  does  not,  moreover,  explain  why  the \ngovernment  has  an  interest  in  restricting  access  to \nabortions by minors in its custody, but not adults in its \ncustody.  The  government  does  not  dispute  that  it \ntransports women and “arrange[s]” for abortions when \nthey  are  in  ICE  or  BOP  custody.8  Yet,  in  apparent \nconflict with these policies, the government states that \nany steps to provide access to an abortion give rise to \nthe interests it asserts, even if the government were to \nplay no role in transporting or paying for an abortion. \nSee Appellants’ Resp. to Pet. for Reh’g En Banc 11–12 \n(Oct.  23,  2017).9  Indeed,  in  its  efforts  to  defeat  class \ncertification,  the  government  now  represents  in  the \nongoing district court proceedings that HHS does not \nhave  a  “policy”  prohibiting  minors  from  attending \nabortion-related appointments and questions whether \nthere  are  any  other  cases  in  which  the  defendants \n\n8 See ICE, Detention Standard 4.4, Medical Care (Women), at \n325  (revised  Dec.  2016),  https://www.ice.gov/doclib/detention-\nstandards/2011/4-4.pdf (if an ICE detainee requests abortion, ICE \n“shall arrange for transportation at no cost” to the detainee); 28 \nC.F.R. § 551.23(c) (federal inmate may decide whether to have an \nabortion and, if she does, “the Clinical Director shall arrange for \nan abortion to take place”). \n\n9 See also Pet. App. 29a (concurrence of Millett, J.)

This  Court’s  review  of \ninterlocutory  determinations  is  the  exception  rather \nthan the rule. See Va. Military Inst. v. United States, \n508  U.S.  946,  946  (1993)  (Scalia,  J.,  concurring  in \ndenial  of  writ  of  certiorari).  Here,  the  government \nitself argued that en banc review was “premature” and \n“inappropriate at this interlocutory stage of the case” \nbecause of the lack of a well-developed factual record \ngiven the expedited proceedings. Appellants’ Resp. to \nPet. for Reh’g En Banc 12–14 (Oct. 23, 2017) (focusing \non claims about the sponsorship process and Ms. Doe’s \nimmigration  status);  see  also  Pet.  App.  63a  n.6 \n(Kavanaugh, J., dissenting) (factual record in this case \nis both “under-developed” and “still unclear and hotly \ncontested”). \n\nIn short, the petition fails to show—or even to argue \nin full—that the decision below warrants this Court’s \nreview. \n\nII.  MS.  DOE’S  CLAIMS  REGARDING  THE \nTREATMENT OF PREGNANT MINORS ARE \nNOT MOOT. \n\nThe  only  question the  government  presents  for  the \nCourt’s  review  is  whether  it  should  vacate  the  D.C. \nCircuit’s  decision  and  remand  with  instructions  to \ndismiss  “all  claims  for  prospective  relief  regarding \npregnant unaccompanied minors” on the ground that \nsuch claims were mooted by Ms. Doe’s abortion. Pet. I, \n19 (emphasis added). The government fails, however, \n\n \n\f18 \n\nto demonstrate that any of the claims for prospective \nrelief in Ms. Doe’s complaint regarding the treatment \nof  pregnant  unaccompanied  minors  are  moot.  The \nrelief  it  requests  from  this  Court—vacatur  of  the \ndenial of a stay pending appeal followed by dismissal \nof  an  array  of  claims  that  are  still  being  litigated \nbelow—is therefore unwarranted.10 \n\nAs an initial matter, Ms. Doe indisputably has live \nclaims for injunctive relief to prevent the government \nfrom retaliating against her for her decision to have an \nabortion and to prevent it from disclosing information \nabout  her abortion  decision  to third  parties.  See  Pet. \nApp.  67a  (amended  TRO);  Order  (Oct.  30,  2017) \n(extending  portions  of  the  TRO);  Compl.  16.  The \ngovernment appears to agree that these claims remain \nlive.  See  Pet.  24  (discussing  disclosure  claim).11  Ms. \nDoe also seeks to bring these claims on behalf of the \nclass. Compl. 16. \n\nIn  addition,  Ms.  Doe’s  claims  regarding  access  to \nabortion—for  which  she  also  seeks  injunctive  relief, \nCompl. 15–16—fall  into  established  exceptions  to \nmootness.  See,  e.g.,  Roe  v.  Wade,  410  U.S.  113,  125 \n(1973) (“[p]regnancy provides a classic justification for \na conclusion of nonmootness”). This is particularly the \ncase here, where Ms. Doe brings these claims on behalf \nof both herself and a class of minors in HHS custody. \n\n10 The  government  does  not  claim—indeed  it  could  not—that \nvacatur  is  warranted  because  the  case  has  become  moot.  Thus, \neven  in  its  own  view,  the  Court’s  “general  practice”  under \nMunsingwear would not be appropriate here. Pet. 24. Instead, it \nrequests that this Court decide in the first instance that certain \nof Ms. Doe’s claims are moot and direct their dismissal.  \n\n11 Indeed,  the  government  has  filed  a  still-pending  motion \nseeking  to  modify  the  TRO  to  permit  it  to  disclose  Ms.  Doe’s \nabortion. Defs.’ Mot. for Recons. of the Court’s October 30, 2017 \nOrder Extending the Am. TRO (Nov. 6, 2017). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f19 \n\nCompl.  ¶¶  55–56.  Indeed,  courts  have  recognized  in \nthe  class  action  context  that  claims  based  on \ntemporary  conditions  may  continue  even  if  the \nputative named plaintiff’s claims become moot during \nthe  litigation.  The  government  is  therefore  incorrect \nthat  “claims  for  injunctive  relief”  related  to  the \nputative  class  are  moot.  Pet.  25.  This  Court  has \nrepeatedly  stated  that  a  class  action  remains  live  in \nvarious  circumstances  where  a  motion  for  class \ncertification  was  filed  prior  to  the  named  plaintiff’s \nclaim  becoming  moot.  See,  e.g.,  Cty.  of  Riverside  v. \nMcLaughlin,  500  U.S.  44,  52  (1991)  (“That  the  class \nwas  not  certified  until  after  the  named  plaintiffs’ \nclaims  had  become  moot  does  not  deprive  us  of \njurisdiction.”);  U.S.  Parole  Comm’n  v.  Geraghty,  445 \nU.S. 388, 398–99 (1980) (“named plaintiff may litigate \nthe class certification issue despite loss of his personal \nstake in the outcome of the litigation” when claims are \n“capable  of  repetition,  yet  evading  review,”  or \n“inherently  transitory”);  Swisher  v.  Brady,  438  U.S. \n204, 213 n.11 (1978); Gerstein v. Pugh, 420 U.S. 103, \n110 n.11 (1975); Sosna v. Iowa, 419 U.S. 393, 402 n.11 \n(1975).   \n\nIn this case, Ms. Doe moved for class certification on \nOctober  18,  when  she  was  indisputably  a  member  of \nthe  putative  class.  And  the  primary  claim  on  which \nMs. Doe seeks to represent a class—the right to access \nabortion  services  while  in  U.S.  custody—is  the \narchetypal example of a claim that is both inherently \ntransitory  and  “capable  of  repetition  yet  evading \nreview.” See, e.g., Roe, 410 U.S. at 125; Doe v. Bolton, \n410 U.S. 179, 187 (1973); Doe v. Charleston Area Med. \nCtr.,  Inc.,  529  F.2d  638,  644  (4th  Cir.  1975); \nCiarpaglini  v.  Norwood,  817  F.3d  541,  547  (7th  Cir. \n2016)  (characterizing  pregnancy  as  an  “inherently \nthe  Court  has \ntransitory”  situation).  In \n\nfact, \n\n \n\f20 \n\nspecifically cited the abortion context as an example of \nthe  type  of  claim  that  is  appropriate  for  class-action \ntreatment  even  in  circumstances  where  the  named \nplaintiff’s  claim  has become  moot.  See  Geraghty,  445 \nU.S.  at  398,  416  n.9  (citing  Roe).  Here,  Ms.  Doe  was \nnot  only  pregnant  but  also  in  federal  custody,  “[t]he \nlength of [which] . . . is impossible to predict.” Thorpe \nv.  Dist.  of  Columbia,  916  F.  Supp.  2d  65,  67  (D.D.C. \n2013); see also Geraghty, 445 U.S. at 399.  \n\nThe  government  argues  that  these  exceptions  to \nclass  action  mootness  cannot  apply  in  this  case \nbecause “[w]e simply do not know whether the district \ncourt  could  have  ruled  on  Ms.  Doe’s  motion  for  class \ncertification  before  her  interest  .  .  .  otherwise  would \nhave expired.” Pet. 26. But this is not the test. Instead, \ncourts look to the uncertainty surrounding the length \nof the condition as a general matter. See Geraghty, 445 \nU.S. at 399 (“It is by no means certain that any given \nindividual,  named  as  plaintiff,  would  be  in  [custody] \nlong  enough  for  a  district  judge  to  certify  the  class.” \n(emphasis added) (quoting Gerstein, 420 U.S. at 110, \nn.11));  Olson  v.  Brown,  594  F.3d  577,  582  (7th  Cir. \n2010)  (“it  is  uncertain  that  any  potential  named \nplaintiff in the class of inmates would have a live claim \nlong enough for a district court to certify a class”).   \n\nfor \n\nrequest \n\nThe  government’s \n\nthis  Court’s \nintervention should be rejected. Its argument that Ms. \nDoe’s claims for prospective relief regarding pregnant \nunaccompanied minors have been mooted is incorrect. \nThe  litigation  continues  below,  and  there  is  no \njustification  for  this Court  to  disrupt  that  process  by \nprematurely dismissing Ms. Doe’s legal claims.12 \n\n12 The petition does not, moreover, cite cases where this Court \nhas granted review in order to direct vacatur of an interlocutory \nruling in such a posture.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f21 \n\nIII.  VACATUR IS NOT WARRANTED. \n\nThe  government’s  asserted  rationale  for  vacatur  is \nequally unpersuasive. The petition seeks to vacate the \nD.C. Circuit’s decision to ensure that the ruling does \nnot “spawn[] any legal consequences.” Pet. 23 (quoting \nUnited States v. Munsingwear, 340 U.S. 36, 41 (1950)). \nEven if this rationale constituted sufficient grounds for \nthe  Court  to  grant  discretionary  review  and  vacate \n(and  the  government  agrees  it  does  not,  see  supra \nSection  I),  the  supposed  “legal  consequences”  are \nwholly  illusory.  No  purpose  would  be  served  by  the \nrelief  the  government  seeks.  The  D.C.  Circuit’s \ninterlocutory stay decision controls none of the issues \nbeing litigated. If and when the courts below reach the \nmerits  and  resolve  the  outstanding  issues,  the \ngovernment  will  have  a  full  opportunity  to  seek \nfurther review.   \n\nThe  government  points  to  Ms.  Doe’s  Bivens  claims \nand her putative class action as matters that it fears \nwill be “constrained” by the decision below. Pet. 23–24. \nThat  argument  might  carry  force  had  the  court  of \nappeals  actually  resolved  the  merits  of  any  issue \npresented  in  the  complaint.  But,  as  explained  above, \nthe  only  issue  before  the  court  of  appeals,  and  all  it \ndecided, was whether the defendants were entitled to \na  stay  pending  appeal.  Particularly  given  the \nsummary nature of its order, this interlocutory ruling \nwill  not  “constrain”  a  future  court  that  is  presented \nwith  the  merits  following  full  briefing.  See  18B \nCharles  Alan  Wright  &  Arthur  R.  Miller,  Federal \nPractice  &  Procedure  §  4478.5,  at  797  (2d  ed.  2002) \n(“law of the case is not established by . . . denial of a \nstay . . . pending appeal”). Even rulings on preliminary \ninjunctive  relief  are  not  controlling  with  respect  to \nsubsequent  final  determinations  on  the  merits.  See \nUniv.  of  Tex.  v.  Camenisch,  451  U.S.  390,  394–95 \n\n \n\f22 \n\n(1981); Berrigan v. Sigler, 499 F.2d 514, 518 (D.C. Cir. \n1974).  The  government  will  be  free  to  seek  both \nappellate  court  review  and  this  Court’s  review  when \nthe case reaches final judgment on the merits—which \nis  yet  another  reason  for  denying  the  petition.  See \nMount  Soledad  Mem’l  Ass’n  v.  Trunk,  567  U.S.  944 \n(2012) (Alito, J., concurring in denial of certiorari).   \n\nAt bottom, the government appears to be asking the \nCourt  for  a  do-over  in  light  of  its  failure  to  seek \nimmediate review of the court of appeals’ decision. But \nthat  is  a  problem  of  its  own  making,  and  it  fails  to \nidentify  any  reason  this  Court’s  resources  should  be \nexpended  reviewing  the  denial  of  an  emergency  stay \npending appeal. Seeking an immediate stay from this \nCourt when it was still timely to do so would have been \ncompletely  consistent  with  the  proceedings  in  this \ncase.13 Like Munsingwear itself, this is a case “where \nthe United States, having slept on its rights, now asks \nus to do what by orderly procedure it could have done \nfor itself.” 340 U.S. at 41. This Court should therefore \ndecline  to  vacate  the  decision  below.  See Mahoney  v. \nBabbitt,  113  F.3d  219,  221–22  (D.C.  Cir.  1997) \n(vacatur  of  preliminary  injunction  not  appropriate \nwhere government failed to seek a Supreme Court stay \nbefore  the  mooting  event  occurred  the  day  after  the \ninjunction). \n\n13 For instance, when the district court issued the initial TRO \non  October  18  at  3:17  p.m.,  the  government  filed  a  notice  of \nappeal, a motion for a stay pending appeal, and an administrative \nstay by 8:20 p.m. the same day. After the en banc court of appeals \nissued its October 24 order at 1:49 p.m., respondent’s counsel filed \na motion for an amended TRO at 3:04 p.m.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f23 \n\nIV.  THERE  IS  NO  BASIS  FOR  DISCIPLINARY \nRESPONDENT’S \n\nAGAINST \n\nACTION \nCOUNSEL. \n\nThe  government’s  concluding  suggestion  that  this \nCourt “may wish to issue an order to show cause why \ndisciplinary  action  should  not  be  taken”  against \nrespondent’s  counsel,  Pet.  26,  is  both  extraordinary \nand baseless. It finds no support in the facts or the law.   \n\nof,  and \n\nthe  availability \n\nThe government’s recitation of events shows that: (1) \nMs. Doe’s counsel made a series of accurate statements \nconcerning \nlogistics \nsurrounding,  Ms.  Doe’s  ability  to  obtain  an  abortion; \n(2) some government personnel may have incorrectly \nassumed  that  Ms.  Doe  could  not  obtain  an  abortion \nbefore October 26, even though she was legally entitled \nto  obtain  an  immediate  abortion,  and  had  received \nstate-mandated  counseling  on  October  19;  (3)  some \ngovernment lawyers may have believed that Ms. Doe’s \ncounsel  would  advise  them  if  facts  changed;  and  (4) \nMs.  Doe’s  counsel  did  not  take  affirmative  steps  to \nnotify  the  government  that  the  doctor  who  provided \nthe counseling on October 19 agreed to come back to \nthe  clinic.  The  government’s  suggestion  that  this \nmight  amount  to  sanctionable  misconduct  is  not \nsupported  by  legal  authorities  regarding  attorney \nconduct,  is  not  remotely  justified  by  the  disciplinary \ncases it cites,14 and is contrary to counsel’s respective \nethical duties. \n\n14 E.g.,  In  re  Hall,  57  S.  Ct.  107  (1936)  (disbarment  order \nrelated to In re Hall, 56 S. Ct. 86 (1935) (attorney special master \nabused appointment to coerce a litigant)); In re Davis, 289 U.S. \n704 (1933) (reprimand for failure to respond to communications \nfrom the clerk regarding outstanding fees); In re Gilbert, 276 U.S. \n294 (1928) (suspension for improperly retaining fees); In re Moore, \n177 F. Supp. 2d 197, 1998–99 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (explaining that In \n\n \n                                                      \n\f24 \n\nin \n\nthe  emails  or \n\nIn  an  effort  to  show  otherwise,  the  government \nrepeatedly claims that opposing counsel “represented” \n“that no abortion would take place until October 26,” \nPet.  11;  see  also  id.  at  13,  14,  19.  Yet  no  such \nrepresentation  appears \nthe \ndeclaration of the AUSA lodged with the Court by the \nSolicitor  General  that  the  government  cites.  Instead, \nthe  events  recited  in  the  petition  indicate  that  Ms. \nDoe’s  representatives  stated  at  various  times  on \nOctober 24 that the physician who was available at the \nclinic on October 24 (who was not the physician who \noriginally  provided  the  state-mandated  counseling) \ncould provide a new counseling session, which would \ntrigger a 24-hour waiting period. See 11/1/2017 AUSA \nDecl. ¶¶ 6–7. The government does not claim that any \nof these statements was false.  \n\nThe  government  also  points  to  statements  that \nrespondent’s  counsel  made  to  the  district  court  on \nOctober  24.  The  petition  states  that  respondent’s \ncounsel represented to the court “that for Ms. Doe to \nobtain an abortion, she would need to complete a two-\nstep, 24-hour process.” Pet. 12. But this misrepresents \ncounsel’s  filing.  Counsel  requested  an  amendment  to \nthe original TRO to make clear that its relief and the \ngovernment’s obligation to transport or allow Ms. Doe \nto be transported should be effective that very day. In \nsupport of this change, counsel noted that “a qualified \n\nre Disbarment of Moore, 529 U.S. 1127 (2000), involved a petition \nfor certiorari that failed to address the merits and accused lower \ncourt of corruption)); see also In re Shipley, 135 S. Ct. 1589, 1589–\n90  (2015)  (discharging  show  cause  order  regarding  Supreme \nCourt Rule 14.3 requirement that petitions for writs of certiorari \nbe  stated  “in  plain  terms,”  and  noting  that  attorneys  “may  not \ndelegate that responsibility to the client”); In re Sibley, 63 S. Ct. \n438  (1943)  (discharging  show  cause  order  without  identifying \nconduct at issue).  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f25 \n\nphysician is available at the nearest clinic today, and \nwill be available to perform the procedure tomorrow.” \nPl.’s  Emergency  Mot.  to  Amend  the  TRO  2  (Oct.  24, \n2017).15 The motion specifically noted that it sought to \nensure  that  Ms.  Doe  could  “obtain  the  abortion  .  .  . \nwithout further delay and as may be required by Texas \nstate law and the availability of physicians.” Id. at 1 \n(emphases  added).  The  motion  thereby  made  clear \nthat  the  TRO  should  enable  Ms.  Doe  to  obtain  an \nabortion  at  the  earliest  time  and  from  any  available \nphysician. \n\nAs  this  motion  underscores,  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  did \nnot represent that, in making arrangements for her to \nsee the physician who was at the clinic on October 24, \nthey  were  forswearing  any  effort  to  secure  an \nappointment with any other doctor who might be able \nto  provide  the  abortion.  Indeed,  the  government \nknew—and  by  its  own  account  acknowledged  to  Ms. \nDoe’s representative on October 24—that the original \ndoctor  could  perform  the  procedure  without  the  need \nto repeat counseling. See 11/1/2017 AUSA Decl. ¶ 7.16 \n\n15 This  statement  was  not  only  true,  it  provided  new \ninformation;  as  of  oral  argument  on  October  20,  there  were  no \ndoctors scheduled to be at the clinic the week of October 23 after \nOctober  24.  D.C.  Cir.  Oral  Arg.  1:13:43–1:14:51,  https:// \nwww.cadc.uscourts.gov/recordings/recordings.nsf/DocsBy \nMonday?OpenView&StartKey=201710&Count=37&scode=3. \n\n16 The  AUSA’s  declaration  states  that,  in  response,  the \nattorney ad litem stated she was referring to “a different doctor” \nwho  could  perform  the  abortion  on  Thursday.  11/1/2017  AUSA \nDecl. ¶ 7. By the government’s own account, this statement was \nentirely accurate. The declaration indicates that the attorney ad \nlitem  was  talking  about  the  doctor  who  was  at  the  clinic  on \nOctober  24,  and  the  fact  that  new  arrangements  were  being \ncontemplated so that that doctor could remain at the clinic longer \nto provide the procedure. See id. ¶ 6.  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f26 \n\nIt  also  knew  that  Ms.  Doe’s  representatives  were \nconsidering various logistical arrangements to ensure \nthat  a  doctor  would  be  available  to  provide  her \nabortion. Id. ¶ 6. These facts show that the situation \nwas fluid; Ms. Doe’s representatives were considering \nmultiple alternatives; and they were seeking to obtain \nMs.  Doe’s  long-delayed  abortion  as  soon  as  possible. \nThe  government  implies  that  it  reasonably  believed \nthese alternatives did not include any effort to return \nthe original doctor to the facility, and claims that Ms. \nDoe’s  attorney  ad  litem  had  stated  that  this  doctor \n“was not available,” Pet. 13. But this suggestion rests \non  yet  another  misleading  paraphrase:  According  to \nthe  government’s  own  declaration,  the  attorney  ad \nlitem stated that the original doctor “was not available \non  October  24.”  11/1/2017  AUSA  Decl.  ¶ 6  (emphasis \nadded).  The  government  does  not  claim  that  the \nstatement actually made was inaccurate, or that it was \na  representation  that  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  would  make \nno  effort  to  have  that  doctor  return to  the  facility  on \nOctober 25. \n\nThe government also points to a telephone call and \nexchanges  of  emails  on  October  24  in  an  effort  to \nsuggest that respondent’s counsel provided assurances \nthat  the  government  did  not  need  to  request  a  stay \nbecause the abortion would not occur until October 26. \nSpecifically, the government makes much of an email \nexchange in which one of its lawyers said the attorney \n“would appreciate it if [Ms. Doe’s counsel] could let me \nand [the AUSA] know when the timing for tomorrow’s \nprocedure  is  clarified,”  Pet’rs’  Ex.  F,  and  Ms.  Doe’s \ncounsel  stated  that  “[a]s  soon  as  we  understand  the \nclinic’s  schedule  tomorrow  we  will  let  you  know,” \nPet. 13. \n\n \n\f27 \n\n The government takes this exchange entirely out of \ncontext.  Less  than  an  hour  earlier,  the  shelter  had \nrefused to transport Ms. Doe to the clinic until it had \nORR’s approval, and the government had been advised \nthat  opposing  counsel  would  “initiate  contempt \nproceedings”  if  Ms.  Doe  was  not  transported  to  the \nclinic  promptly.  Pet’rs’  Ex.  C.  The  government \nattorney called respondent’s counsel shortly thereafter \nto  explain  that  the  shelter  needed  advance  notice  to \narrange  transportation,  and  to  confirm  that  Ms.  Doe \nwas now being transported to the clinic. See Pet. 12–\n13. The government attorney then sent the email that \nconfirmed  “[the  attorney’s]  understanding  that  the \nshelter  had  arranged  for  transport  services  this \nevening  per  your  email,”  and  included  the  attorney’s \nrequest \ntiming  of \n“tomorrow’s procedure.” Pet’rs’ Ex. F.  \n\ninformation  about \n\nthe \n\nfor \n\nIn  context,  the  email  exchange  merely  documents \nthe government’s compliance with its obligation under \nthe TRO to provide transportation, its commitment to \ndo so again the following day, and counsel’s agreement \nto let the government know when Ms. Doe needed to \nbe  at  the  clinic  the  next  day  to  avoid  any  further \nproblems  with \nthe \ngovernment’s email does not mention any stay motion, \nlet alone link the request to the timing of such a filing. \nNor  does  the  government  claim  that  its  attorney \nmentioned any stay application in the earlier call. It is \nnow wishful thinking to argue that this exchange over \n\ntransportation.17  Critically, \n\nfor  pre-abortion  counseling.  The  request \n\n17 At  the  time  of  the  government’s  email,  Ms.  Doe  was  being \ntransported \nfor \ninformation about the timing of the next day’s “procedure” is thus \nsensibly understood as no more than a request to be informed of \nMs.  Doe’s  schedule  the  next  day  so  that  the  necessary \ntransportation could be arranged.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f28 \n\nreflects \n\nlogistics \n\ntransportation \na  mutual \nunderstanding  that  the  government  need  not  seek  a \nstay because opposing counsel “had represented to the \ngovernment that . . . no abortion would occur until the \nmorning of October 26,” Pet. 19. \n\nThe  government’s  claim  is  further  belied  by  the \nemail exchange the government points to from later in \nthe  evening  of  October  24.  The  government  asserts \nthat, “[b]ased on the representations of counsel that no \nabortion would occur until October 26,” it informed the \nClerk’s Office and respondent’s counsel that it would \nseek a stay the morning of October 25. Pet. 14. But by \nthe  government’s  own  account,  no  communication \nabout the timing of a motion for a stay occurred until \n8:13 p.m. the night of October 24 and, even then, the \nemail  the  government  sent  informing  respondent’s \ncounsel that it would seek a stay in the morning says \nnothing  about  any  such  representations.  Resp’ts’  \nEx.  1.  Nor  does  it  communicate  the  government’s \n“understanding” about the timing of the procedure or \nseek  confirmation  that  respondent’s  counsel  shared \nthat understanding, much less a commitment that her \ncounsel would promptly advise the government of any \nchanged circumstances. Id. The response from one of \nMs.  Doe’s \nincludes  no  such \nlikewise \nconfirmation  or  commitment.  Id.  Indeed,  one  of  her \nattorneys  responded  to  the  8:13 p.m.  email  by \nexpressing relief that he would not have to check his \nemail for any stay motion filed later that night. That \nemail indicates that Ms. Doe’s attorneys had expected \nthe  government  to  seek  a  stay  that  night—an \nexpectation wholly inconsistent with the government’s \nsuggestion  that  there  was  a  mutual  understanding \nthat filing was unnecessary because Ms. Doe’s counsel \n\nlawyers \n\n \n\f29 \n\nhas  represented  that  the  abortion  would  not  occur \nuntil October 26.  \n\nThe Solicitor General argues that these statements \nand  events  of  October  24  led  some  government \npersonnel to assume that Ms. Doe would not be able to \nobtain an abortion prior to October 26. See Letter from \nNoel J. Francisco, Solicitor General, to David D. Cole, \nNational  Legal  Director,  ACLU  2  (Oct.  26,  2017) \n(stating that it relied on representations of counsel and \nothers  and  “our  resulting  understanding  that  no \nabortion  procedure  could  then  take  place”  until \nOctober  26)  (emphasis  added)).  But  none  of  the \nstatements the government cites was a representation, \nmuch less a commitment, “that no abortion would take \nplace until October 26,” Pet. 11. \n\nThe  petition  describes  a  course  of  events  where \nmany  different  parties  were  communicating  into  the \nnight  as  events  unfolded  rapidly.  Particularly  given \nthis  fluid  situation,  and  the  government’s  knowledge \nthat Ms. Doe had sought throughout the litigation to \nobtain  an  abortion  as  soon  as  possible,  it  is  striking \nthat  government  counsel,  by  the  government’s  own \naccount, neither requested that Ms. Doe forbear from \nobtaining the procedure while the government sought \na  stay  from  this  Court  nor  sought  confirmation  of \ngovernment \nthat  no \nabortion would occur prior to October 26. Absent such \na commitment or confirmation, it was incumbent upon \ngovernment  counsel  immediately  to  seek  a  stay.  The \ngovernment cannot now blame opposing counsel for its \nown failure either to act with its customary alacrity or \nto take any protective steps. \n\n“understanding” \n\ncounsel’s \n\nIn short, Ms. Doe’s counsel had made clear that they \nwere  attempting  to  help  their  client  obtain  the \n\n \n\f30 \n\nabortion as soon as possible; the government knew Ms. \nDoe had already received counseling from the original \ndoctor,  so  that  if  that  doctor  became  available,  the \nabortion could take place immediately; and according \nto the government’s own recitation of events, it did not \nlink its request for information about the timing of Ms. \nDoe’s appointment on October 25 with any statement \nconcerning the timing of a stay motion with this Court.  \n\nTo suggest that respondent’s counsel had a duty to \nforbear from effectuating the TRO on October 25 under \nthese facts would turn counsel’s ethical obligations on \ntheir head. The only reason Ms. Doe’s representatives \nneeded to talk to government personnel at all was to \ntell them the timing of Ms. Doe’s appointment so that \nthe  government  would  not  delay  Ms.  Doe’s \ntransportation  to  the  clinic.  If  government  counsel \nwished to ensure that they would have an opportunity \nto seek a stay before the abortion procedure, they could \nand  should  have  requested  such  an  assurance  from \nrespondent’s  counsel  and,  if  they  did  not  receive  a \nsufficiently clear commitment, they could and should \nhave immediately sought relief from this Court. They \ninexplicably failed to take these reasonable steps, and \ncannot  now  blame  respondent’s  counsel  for  the \nconsequences of their own inaction.  \n\nIn addition to failing to supply a factual basis for its \nextraordinary request, the government fails to supply \na specific legal rationale or cite to any legal authority \nthat supports its position. The petition vaguely refers \nto “what appear to be material misrepresentations and \nomissions”  by  respondent’s  counsel,  Pet.  26,  a  claim \nthat,  if  true,  would  violate  ethical  rules.  See  ABA, \nModel  Rules  of  Professional  Conduct  R. 3.3  (2016) \n(prohibiting  knowingly  false  statement  of  fact  to  a \ntribunal);  id.  R. 4.1(a)  (barring  “a  false  statement  of \n\n \n\f31 \n\nmaterial fact or law to a third person”); id. R. 4.1 cmt. 1 \n(misrepresentations).  But  the  government  identifies \nno  misrepresentations  and  fails  to  explain  how \ncounsels’  statements  and/or  actions  would  have \namounted to false statements. The petition says that \nrespondent’s  counsel  “arguably”  had  an  obligation  to \nnotify  the  government  that  Ms.  Doe’s  original \nphysician  had  become  available  on  the  morning  of \nOctober 25. Pet. 28. Yet the petition cites to no rule of \nethics, case law, or other authority to support such an \nobligation. Indeed, no such obligation exists—and for \nsensible  reasons.  A \nlawyer  “generally  has  no \naffirmative  duty  to  inform  an  opposing  party  of \nrelevant facts,” except “when disclosure is necessary to \navoid  assisting  a  criminal  or  fraudulent  act  by  a \nclient.” ABA, supra, R. 4.1 & cmt. 1; see id. cmt. 3. A \nlawyer  has  an  “obligation  zealously  to  protect  and \npursue  a  client’s  legitimate  interests,  within  the \nbounds  of  the  law,”  id.  pmbl.,  and  violates  that  duty \n“when he or she . . . fails to take the necessary steps to \npreserve  the client’s interests,”  In  re  Bernstein,  707 \nA.2d  371,  376  (D.C.  1998),  or  to  maintain  client \nconfidentiality,  see  In  re  Gonzalez,  773  A.2d  1026, \n1030–31  (D.C.  2001).18  The  events  the  government \nrecites  show  that  Ms.  Doe’s  counsel  acted  in  their \nclient’s best interests, which is precisely what counsel \nare  supposed  to  do.
