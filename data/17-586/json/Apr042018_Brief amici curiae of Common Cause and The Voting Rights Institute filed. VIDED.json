        "1\n\nINTEREST OF THE AMICI CURIAE1\n\nFounded in 1970, amicus Common Cause is a\nnonprofit, nonpartisan organization dedicated to pro-\ntecting and strengthening democracy and the demo-\ncratic process. Its membership now stands at 1.1 mil-\nlion people. Common Cause has, among other things,\nled the movement to lower the voting age to 18; and\nspearheaded the passage of freedom-of-information\nlaws, government ethics laws, and laws to limit the\ncorrupting influence of money in politics. Gerryman-\ndering is an issue of longstanding interest to Com-\nmon Cause at the national level and in its network of\n35 state organizations.\n\nAmicus Voting Rights Institute (VRI) is a first-of-\nits-kind legal institute established to help enforce\nand protect the rights of American voters. A joint\nproject of Georgetown University Law Center, the\nCampaign Legal Center, and the American Constitu-\ntion Society, VRI assists attorneys, expert witnesses,\nlaw students, and the public combat discriminatory\nvoting practices across the country. It offers oppor-\ntunities for students, recent graduates, and fellows\nto engage in litigation and policy work in the field of\nvoting rights and to educate attorneys about the\nskills and best practices of voting rights advocates. It\nalso recruits and trains expert witnesses to assist in\nlitigation development and presentation; promotes\nincreased local and national focus on voting rights\n\n1 Pursuant to this Court’s Rule 37.6, amici state that no counsel\nfor a party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no\nperson other than amici or their counsel made a monetary con-\ntribution to its preparation or submission. The parties have\nsubmitted blanket consents to the filing of amicus briefs in this\ncase.",
        "2\n\nthrough events, publications and the development of\nweb-based tools; and provides opportunities and plat-\nforms for research on voting rights.\n\nThis case involves the legality of voting districts\nthat the Texas Legislature originally created in 2011.\nAfter the district court invalidated those districts as\ndiscriminatory, the court in 2012 permitted use of\nsome of the districts on an interim basis, expressly\nnoting that its interim review had been limited and\nwas subject to revision. In 2013, the Texas Legisla-\nture re-enacted the same districts—those originally\nheld to be discriminatory—without change. Texas\nnow argues, in part, that adoption of the district\ncourt’s interim plan in 2012 effectively insulates the\n2013 plan from further review. Because this conten-\ntion threatens to subject Texas residents (and, if\nTexas’s theory prevails, residents of other States) to\ndiscriminatory voting regimes, and because amici\nhave considerable experience addressing issues that\nrelate to redistricting, amici submit this brief to as-\nsist the Court in the resolution of the case.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nAppellees show in their briefs that the chal-\nlenged Texas districts were created with a discrimi-\nnatory purpose. That conclusion plainly is correct on\nthe record here: The Texas Legislature knew what it\nwas doing and intended the result when it drew dis-\ntricts that minimized minority voting strength.\n\nIn this brief, we focus on two particular, related\narguments that Texas and the United States ad-\nvance in defense of the challenged 2013 redistricting\nplans in an effort to avoid a conventional—and, from",
        "3\n\ntheir perspective, fatal—inquiry into legislative mo-\ntive.2 First, Texas maintains that the challenged\nplans here were “court-drawn” or “court imposed”\n(see, e.g., Texas Br. i; see also U.S. Br. 24) and that,\nnecessarily, the Legislature’s adoption of a plan that\nhad been validated by a federal court could not have\nbeen improper. And second, Texas insists that the\nimproper purpose that initially motivated adoption of\nPlan H283 in 2011 was somehow laundered out of\nPlan H358 when the Legislature created identical\ndistricts after the district court’s interim approval of\nthose districts in 2012.\n\nThese arguments are wrong. The districts chal-\nlenged here were discriminatory when the Texas\nLegislature created them in 2011. They had not mag-\nically lost their discriminatory purpose when the\nLegislature re-enacted the very same districts two\nyears later.\n\nA. Texas is incorrect when it maintains that the\ndistrict court validated the challenged districts, and\ninsulated them from review, when it permitted their\nuse in the 2012 interim plan. It is fundamental that\ncourts use different standards when issuing prelimi-\nnary or interim relief than they do when making a\nfinal determination on the merits. The need for ex-\npeditious review means that a preliminary ruling is\nissued on a limited record and with less than full\nconsideration; such a ruling is characterized by what\ncourts have called “its for-the-time-beingness.” The\n\n2 The arguments in this brief apply both to the Texas House\ndistricts incorporated in Plan H358 and to the congressional\ndistricts incorporated in Plan C235 that remained unchanged\nfrom Texas’s 2011 state house and congressional plans. For\nsimplicity’s sake, the brief principally discusses Plan H358.",
        "4\n\ndistrict court here emphasized that is just how it re-\ngarded its interim ruling, which it repeatedly said\nwas not definitive and was subject to revision. That\nruling does not establish the ultimate validity of the\nchallenged districts, and Texas could not reasonably\nhave relied on it for that purpose.\n\nB. The interim ruling also does not launder the\nTexas Legislature’s discriminatory purpose out of the\ncase. Texas now maintains that it adopted districts\nincluded in the interim plan simply to bring an expe-\nditious end to the redistricting litigation. But Texas’s\nstated motive is not the end of the matter: It remains\nthe Court’s duty to determine the Legislature’s actu-\nal intent when it chose to re-enact districts that had\nbeen held to be the product of a discriminatory pur-\npose. And here, all of the usual indicia of legislative\nintent—including the history, context, and prior ju-\ndicial constructions of the legislative language—\nsupport the district court’s finding that the Texas\nLegislature adopted the 2013 plan with a discrimina-\ntory purpose.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nA. The Texas Legislature initially drew the\ndistricts at issue here with a discriminatory\npurpose.\n\nAppellees address the history of the Texas plan\nat issue in this case in detail (Appellees’ Br. 2-253),\nand there is no need to repeat that presentation\nhere. But for purposes of the arguments addressed in\nthis brief, one element of the record warrants special\nemphasis: the district court’s findings regarding the\n\n3 References here to “Appellees’ Brief” are to appellees’ brief re-\nlating to the State House districts.",
        "5\n\ndiscriminatory intent that underlay the initial draw-\ning in 2011 of the Texas House districts at issue\nhere. Because it is the position of Texas and the\nUnited States that a plan using those same bounda-\nries was drawn with a benign intent just two years\nlater, it is helpful to bear in mind the specific find-\nings that led the district court to hold those districts\nto have been constructed with the specific purpose of\ndisadvantaging minority voters.\n\n1. In Nueces County, the district court found that\nthe cartographers acted “in bad faith” when they\neliminated HD33 as a Hispanic opportunity district.\nH.J.S. App. 133a. The court found that it was “un-\ndisputed that Nueces County had two benchmark\nLatino opportunity districts” before the 2010 redis-\ntricting cycle. Ibid. Legislators had “three options”\nfor how to district Nueces County: “(1) draw one ‘per-\nforming’ Hispanic district and one not; (2) draw two\nequally Hispanic districts, which may not perform\nreliably; or (3) see if both Latino opportunity districts\ncould be preserved by splitting county lines.” Id. at\n127a.4 The mapmakers pursued the first option, de-\nspite never “seriously look[ing] at whether § 2 [of the\nVoting Rights Act (“VRA”)] might require two oppor-\ntunity districts in Nueces County.” Id. at 127a n.22.\nInstead, they sought to “offset” the loss of HD33 as\nan opportunity district by adding more Latinos to\n\n4 The County Line Rule is a Texas constitutional requirement\nthat legislative districts “preserve whole counties when popula-\ntion mandates permit.” Tex. Const. art. III § 26. To the extent\nthe Texas Constitution conflicts with the Voting Rights Act,\nhowever, federal law controls.",
        "6\n\nHD90 and HD148—districts that were already elect-\ning minority candidates of choice. Ibid.5\n\nThe court found that the “redistricters knew”\nthat these two districts “were already ability dis-\ntricts, and thus that increasing their SSVR did not\ncreate any ‘new’ ability district to offset the loss of\nHD33.” H.J.S. App. 135a. Hence, the court found\nthat the true motive was “to intentionally dilute La-\ntino voting strength by * * * allowing redistricting\nleadership to claim that they were complying with\nthe VRA despite eliminating HD33 and creating no\nnew opportunity or ability districts.” Id. at 137a.\n\nfrom which the\n\nThe district court also found “evidence that the\nmapdrawers (including specifically Rep. Hunter) ra-\ncially gerrymandered the districts that remained in\nNueces County to further undermine Latino voting\nstrength.” H.J.S. App. 136a. The court noted that\n“[t]here are ten precinct splits along the HD32/HD34\ninferred that\nborder”\n“mapdrawers were likely using race to assign popu-\nlation since accurate political data is not available\nbelow the precinct level.” Ibid. The goal of these\nsplits, according to the district court, was to “inten-\ntionally pack[] Hispanic voters into HD32 to mini-\nmize their number and influence in HD34” to protect\nthe Republican incumbent. Ibid. The court also found\nevidence that the mapdrawers “targeted low turnout\n\ncourt\n\n5 The district court also found that the mapmakers intentional-\nly relied on Spanish Surname Voter Registration (“SSVR”) as a\nmeasure of the relevant Latino population in Nueces County,\neven though they knew that Hispanic Citizen Voting Age Popu-\nlation (“HCVAP”) was the more appropriate measure, because\n“SSVR was lower (and lower than 50%), and it allowed them to\nargue that mathematically, two SSVR-majority districts could\nnot be drawn.” H.J.S. App 134a.",
        "7\n\nminority areas” for inclusion in HD34 to protect the\nRepublican incumbent. Ibid. Finally, the court found\nevidence that the mapmakers intentionally overpop-\nulated HD32 (and underpopulated HD34), without a\nlegitimate justification for doing so. Ibid. All of these\nfindings contributed to the conclusion that the Texas\nLegislature had engaged in intentional vote dilution.\n\n2. The district court found that in Dallas County,\nthe mapdrawers intended to “dilute minority voting\nstrength to protect a Republican incumbent\nin\nHD105 by intentionally making the district more\nAnglo.” H.J.S. App. 170a. The court found that the\n“Anglo population decreased by 198,000 in Dallas\nCounty” even while the population of Dallas County\nas a whole grew by 350,000. Id. at 261a. As such, the\nmapmakers knew that two of the three districts in\nDallas County would have to be minority districts.\nSee id. at 171a. As one advisor to the mapmakers\nexplained, however,\nit might “get ‘worse’ because\nthey might have to draw a third Latino district,\nwhich would mean the loss of a third Republican\nseat.” Ibid. But instead of “exploring whether any\nadditional minority districts could be drawn or main-\ntained to recognize the population growth,”\nthe\nmapmakers decided to pack as many Latino voters\nas possible into the two minority districts and there-\nfore “eliminated districts that were on track to per-\nform for minority voters.” Ibid.\n\nIn fact, one of the redistricters “admitted to split-\nting precincts to put the Hispanic population into\nHD104 and HD103 and the Anglo population in\nHD105.” H.J.S. App. 171a. Although this legislator\nclaimed that he took this step to comply with the\nVRA, the district court found “that this was yet an-\nother example of mapdrawers using superficial com-",
        "8\n\npliance with the VRA to dilute minority voting\nstrength rather than enhancing it.” Ibid. By doing\nso, the Legislature made it less likely that Latinos\nwould elect their candidate of choice in HD105. Id. at\n261a & n.35. Hence, the district court found that the\nLegislature’s “true motive was to dilute Latino voting\nstrength in west Dallas County by unnecessarily\nplacing Latinos” into two already Latino districts to\nmake HD105 more Anglo, and more strongly protec-\ntive of the incumbent Republican. Id. at 172a. The\ndistrict court concluded that this strategy was inten-\ntional discrimination in violation of the VRA.\n\n3. The mapmakers split the City of Killeen in\nBell County, a paradigmatic community of interest,\nbetween two districts “to ensure that” those districts\n“remained Anglo-majority, and would reelect Repub-\nlican incumbents.” H.J.S. App. 183a. The district\ncourt found that “the evidence does indicate that\nmapdrawers * * * intentionally racially gerryman-\ndered the districts to dilute the minority vote by\nmoving minority population out of HD54 and moving\nAnglo population in.” Id. at 181a. Thus, the court\nconcluded that mapmakers swapped minority and\nAnglo communities to make “it more difficult for mi-\nnority voters in HD54 to elect their candidate of\nchoice.” Ibid.\n\nThe court reached this conclusion because it\nfound the reasons offered by the mapmaker who split\nKilleen “not credible.” H.J.S. App. 182a-183a. That\nrepresentative testified that he believed some areas\nin Bell County had more in common with a neighbor-\ning county. Id. at 182a. The court, however, rejected\nthat reasoning as “pretextual” cover for his intent to\n“crack[] and dilut[e] the minority vote to ensure An-\nglo control over both districts.” Id. at 181a. Specifi-",
        "9\n\ncally, although the mapmaker opposed an alternative\nmap that would have kept Killeen whole because it\nhad a “land bridge” that connected Killeen to other\ncommunities, “Plan H283 includes land bridges in\nother areas and he voted for it.” Id. at 182a-183a.\nThe court concluded that the legislator was motivat-\ned by the knowledge that “a minority coalition dis-\ntrict [such as Killeen] would not likely have enough\nRepublicans to re-elect him.” Id. at 182a.\n\nAccordingly, the background of the current con-\ntroversy is clear and, for present purposes, essential-\nly undisputed. The Texas Legislature drew the par-\nticular districts that we address for the specific, race-\nconscious purpose of disadvantaging Latino voters.\nThe State’s arguments to the contrary, the district\ncourt found, were pretextual. The question now is\nwhether these findings of improper intent have any\nbearing on the Texas Legislature’s motive in placing\nthe same districts in a plan it enacted two years lat-\ner.\n\nB. Texas’s attempt to equate preliminary find-\nings with a final decision on the merits is\nunavailing.\n\nIn defending districts that initially were drawn\nfor these manifestly improper purposes, Texas insists\nthat the district lines used in Plan H358 must be val-\nid because the district court approved the same lines\nin the interim plan it set in 2012. As Texas would\nhave it, that approval means that the challenged dis-\ntricts should be treated as court-drawn, so that the\ndistrict court, in the decision below, found that “its\nown maps were infected with the ‘taint of discrimina-",
        "10\n\ntory intent.’” Texas Br. 1 (emphasis in original).6\nThis contention is central to the State’s case; as ap-\npellees note (Appellees’ Br. 1), Texas repeats the as-\nsertion that the challenged plan is “court-drawn” or\n“court imposed” at least eleven times throughout its\nbrief.\n\nThis facially improbable contention, however, is\nwrong. The district court’s avowedly preliminary and\ninterim approval of the challenged districts—a prod-\nuct of exigent circumstances and severe time con-\nstraints—was not intended to be, and could not rea-\nsonably have been taken by Texas legislators to have\nbeen intended as, an endorsement of the ultimate va-\nlidity of these districts. In fact, Texas’s novel theory\ndisregards not only the plain meaning of “prelimi-\nnary” and “interim,” but also this Court’s long-\nstanding precedent and the Federal Rules’ estab-\nlished procedures for combining preliminary and fi-\nnal relief. Plan H358 was not the district court’s\nplan; it was the Texas Legislature’s plan. The reality\nis that all the districts at issue were drawn by the\nLegislature, some in 2011 and the rest in 2013.\n\n1. A preliminary injunction is not a decision\n\non the merits.\n\na. Texas’s argument is premised on the assump-\ninterim\ntion that the district court’s preliminary,\nplan reflects the court’s judgment that the districts\nincluded in that plan express an ultimate judgment\nthat these districts are valid. But that plainly is not\nso. As this Court has long recognized, “the findings of\nfact and conclusions of law made by a court granting\n\n6 The United States is more restrained in its characterizations,\nbut does refer to the plan as the court’s “own.” U.S. Br. 24.",

Although district courts “should\nmake the findings of fact and conclusions of law that\nare appropriate to the interlocutory proceeding,” the-\nse findings must not be treated as a “decision * * * on\nthe merits.” Public Serv. Comm’n of Wis. v. Wis. Tel.\nCo., 289 U.S. 67, 71 (1933).\n\nIt is because “the necessity for an expeditious\nresolution often means that the injunction is issued\non a procedure less stringent than that which pre-\nvails at the subsequent trial” that preliminary in-\njunctions are not final. Thornburgh v. American Coll.\nof Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 755-\n756 (1986), overruled on other grounds by Planned\nParenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).\nOn later review, a court may reverse some or all of\nits initial findings based on a more fully developed\nrecord and greater time for deliberation. Thus, “any\nconclusions reached at the preliminary injunction\nstage are subject to revision.” Walters v. National\nAss’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 317\n(1985) (citing Camenisch, 451 U.S. at 395).\n\nThis principle has never been in doubt. As re-\ncently as last Term,\nthe Court affirmed that\n“[c]rafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of\ndiscretion and judgment,” the purpose of which “is\nnot to conclusively determine the rights of the par-\nties, but to balance the equities as the litigation\nmoves forward.” Trump v. International Refugee As-\nsistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (inter-\nnal citations omitted).

This is, indeed,\na ruling characterized by its “for-the-time-being-\nness.”\n\nb. Preliminary injunctions are preliminary for\nthis very reason. Courts must make fast determina-\ntions on relatively little information.

Therefore,\ncourts rarely grant full injunctive relief at the pre-\nliminary stage.\n\nIt is thus no surprise that the district court\ngranted only partial relief here. Acting under severe\nrecord and time constraints—and mindful of the cost\nto the State—the court invalidated only some of the\nchallenged districts. Later, with the full record in\nhand and time for reflection, the court invalidated\nadditional districts.\n\nThis again should come as no surprise to Texas.\nCourts reverse their determinations between the pre-\nliminary and final stages of litigation all the time.\nDistrict courts frequently deny preliminary relief on-\nly to grant permanent relief,8 and vice versa.9 Appel-\n\n8 See, e.g., United Motorcoach Ass’n, Inc. v.

There is noth-\ning strange or untoward about the district court re-\nvising its initial determinations in light of a finished\nrecord and time for considered judgment. Texas can-\nnot claim that its plans were upset by an ordinary\nreversal of fortunes, of the sort litigants routinely\nface.\n\nc.

This argument misun-\nderstands the governing standard.\n\nThat standard is pro “status quo” (42 Am. Jur. 2d\nInjunctions § 9), not pro-plaintiff.

Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1347-1348 (11th Cir. 2009) (deny-\ning a permanent injunction in a voter ID law case, despite the\nissuance of preliminary relief).\n\n10 Compare Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm'n v. National\nFootball League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1204 (9th Cir. 1980) (reversing\na preliminary injunction, because plaintiffs had not shown a\nlikelihood of irreparable injury), with Los Angeles Mem'l Coli-\nseum Comm’n v.

        "17\n\ntrial on the merits can be held.” Camenisch, 451 U.S.\nat 395. The purpose of the standard is to “balance the\nequities” (Trump, 137 S. Ct. at 2087) and preserve\nthe litigating positions of the parties for trial. For\nthat reason, “[a]n injunction is considered an ex-\ntraordinary remedy that should be exercised sparing-\nly and cautiously.” 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions § 17\n(footnotes omitted). Here, that standard militated in\nfavor of the court preserving for interim use the dis-\ntrict boundaries initially drawn by the Texas Legis-\nlature.\n\nTexas’s arguments thus misstate the standard. It\nis no surprise that the district court denied the plain-\ntiffs full relief on a slim record and under extreme\ntime pressure. Texas cannot shield its map from fur-\nther constitutional review in reliance on relief that\nwas, by its very nature, ephemeral and extraordi-\nnary.\n\n3. Texas cannot evade review by relying on\n\nthe court’s interim findings.\n\nAgainst this background, Texas could not rea-\nsonably have believed that the district court’s inter-\nim findings established the ultimate validity of the\ndistricts incorporated in the 2012 plan. The State’s\ncurrent suggestion that it expected use of districts\npermitted by the interim plan to end the redistrict-\ning litigation therefore simply is not plausible.\n\na. Courts have long cautioned litigants against\nplacing too much faith in preliminary findings. In\ncircumstances generally similar to those here, the\nSecond Circuit recently chided a state university for\nrelying on statements in an order granting prelimi-\nnary relief. As the Second Circuit explained:",
        "18\n\n[The university]—or certainly its able coun-\nsel—surely knew the risks of such reliance.\n“A decision on a preliminary injunction is, in\neffect, only a prediction about the merits of\nthe case,” thus, “findings of fact and conclu-\nsions of law made by a court granting a pre-\nliminary injunction are not binding,” and “do\nnot preclude reexamination of the merits at a\nsubsequent trial.”\n\nBiediger v. Quinnipiac Univ., 691 F.3d 85, 107 (2d\nCir. 2012) (quoting Morris v. Hoffa, 361 F.3d 177,\n189 (3d Cir. 2004); Camenisch, 451 U.S. at 395; and\nIrish Lesbian & Gay Org. v.

Defendants in a re-\ncent pharmaceutical case contended that they rea-\nsonably relied on the court’s denial of preliminary re-\nlief in issuing a competing product. The court reject-\ned this argument: “Although Defendants did not\nlaunch their generic product until after the prelimi-\nnary injunction was denied, the preliminary injunc-\ntion was, by definition, preliminary and not a final\nruling on the validity of the * * * patent.” Sanofi-\nAventis Deutschland GmbH v.

Appellate courts have similarly cautioned dis-\ntrict courts against overreliance on their own prelim-\ninary findings.\n\nAs the Seventh Circuit has explained, “exclu-\nsive[]” reliance on preliminary findings “can be a\nrisky approach.

There is a procedure for combining pre-\nliminary hearings with a decision on the\nmerits, but it was not used here.\n\nTexas’s reliance on preliminary findings is not\nonly wrong; it ignores an established procedure for\ncombining preliminary relief with a final decision on\nthe merits. Neither the district court nor Texas pur-\nsued this procedure here.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2) sets out\na process for combining preliminary and final relief:\n“Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction, the court may advance\nthe trial on the merits and consolidate it with the\nhearing.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2).\n\nThis procedure requires advance notice to the\n\nparties. As this Court has explained:\n\nBefore such an order may issue, however, the\ncourts have commonly required that “the\nparties should normally receive clear and\nunambiguous notice [of the court’s intent to\nconsolidate the trial and the hearing] either\nbefore the hearing commences or at a time\n\ninjunction * * * does not limit or preclude the parties from liti-\ngating the merits * * * .

Bldg., 463 F.2d 1055,\n1057 (7th Cir. 1972)).\n\nIf the Rule 65(a)(2) process is not specifically in-\nvoked, it is generally improper to adopt findings from\na preliminary hearing at the merits stage without\nadditional explanation. See, e.g., Sanchez v. Esso\nStandard Oil Co., 572 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2009).\n“When a trial court ‘disposes of a case on the merits\nafter a preliminary-injunction hearing without ex-\npressly ordering consolidation * * * it is likely that\none or more of the parties will not [have] present[ed]\ntheir entire case at [the] unconsolidated preliminary-\ninjunction hearing.’ Therefore, it is ordinarily im-\nproper to decide a case solely on such a basis.” Ibid.\n(quoting\n11A C. Wright, A.

Litigants rely on such determina-\ntions at their peril, and the district court here would\nhave erred had it found that its interim plan insulat-\ned the districts utilized in that plan from further re-\nview—that is, if it had done what Texas now says it\nshould have done. That the Texas Legislature took\naccount of the interim plan in 2013 when it drew\nPlan H358 may bear on the Legislature’s intent at\nthat time, but the existence of the plan cannot be a\nmagic bullet that wins the case for the State or eras-\nes the intent that actually underlay the 201 plan..",

As Texas tells the story, the court blessed the\ndistricts challenged here, in the process laundering\nout the discriminatory intent of the 2011 Legislature.\nThe Legislature’s adoption of the interim plan, the\nstory continues, then effectively became implementa-\ntion of a benign court-ordered plan rather than re-\nenactment of a discriminatory one. Texas Br. 36 (ar-\nguing that 2013 plan adopted simply to “bring exist-\ning litigation to an end”); see U.S. Br. 41. But this\nstory is a tall tale. Texas’s purported reliance on the\ndistrict court’s blessing cannot end the inquiry; the\nLegislature’s actual intent remains subject to in-\nquiry.\n\nThat determination “demands a sensitive inquiry\ninto * * * circumstantial and direct evidence of in-\ntent.” Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977).

Texas’s real motive was to re-enact the\n\ndiscriminatory 2011 maps.\n\nIn characterizing the legislative motive, Texas’s\ncentral argument appears to be that, in re-enacting\nthe district court’s interim plan, the Texas Legisla-\nture’s intent was simply to adopt a court-approved\nplan as a way to end the redistricting litigation, thus\nrendering irrelevant the 2011 plan (and the associat-\ned finding of improper motive). But the State’s asser-\ntion of this anodyne intent cannot be the end of the\nstory.\n\nAs the Court has held, “the mere recitation of a\nbenign[] * * * purpose is not an automatic shield\nwhich protects against any inquiry into the actual\npurposes underlying a statutory scheme.” Wiesenfeld,\n420 U.S. at 648. That the Texas Legislature chose to\n\n12 Even accepting the State’s counter-factual premise that Tex-\nas simply implemented a court-ordered plan in 2013 would not\nend the inquiry. Court-ordered plans may themselves violate\nthe Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. See, e.g., Connor v.\nFinch, 431 U.S. 407 (1977) (overturning a court-ordered reap-\nportionment plan for failing to meet “one-person, one vote”);\nChapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975) (same). And when a\nlegislature adopts a court’s plan, the plan is still subject to sub-\nstantive review. For example, under the Voting Rights Act,\n“[e]ven in the[] cases” where a court orders a plan, “if the gov-\nernmental body subsequently adopts a plan patterned after the\ncourt’s plan, Section 5 review would be required.” See McDaniel\nv. Sanchez, 452 U.S. 130, 149 (1981). Whenever a legislature\n“submits a proposal reflecting the policy choices of the elected\nrepresentatives of the people—no matter what constraints have\nlimited the choices available to them,” substantive review is\navailable. Id. at 153.",
        "24\n\ninclude in its permanent plan districts that the dis-\ntrict court had approved for interim use says nothing\nabout the Legislature’s actual motive in making that\nchoice; as with any statute, the 2013 redistricting\nplan is subject to examination under the ordinary\nstandards used to determine legislative intent. See\nU.S. Br. 25 (citing Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541,\n549 (1999)). Here, that inquiry leaves no doubt that\nTexas’s real motive in 2013 was not to codify the\n2012 interim plans or to avoid litigation; it was to\nleave the discriminatory 2011 maps in place.\n\nBy asking the Court to completely disregard the\n2011 redistricting maps, Texas seeks to have its in-\ntent evaluated “only from the latest news about the\nlast in a series of governmental actions.” McCreary\nCty. v. ACLU, 545 U.S. 844, 866 (2005). “But,” as the\nCourt has stated, “the world is not made brand new\nevery morning.” Ibid. In arguing to the contrary,\nTexas is “simply asking [the Court] to ignore perfect-\nly probative evidence.” Ibid. In assessing legislative\npurpose, however, the Court is not “an absentminded\nobjective observer,” but one “presumed to be familiar\nwith the history of the government’s actions and\ncompetent to learn what history has to show.” Ibid.\n\nIn fact, the 2011 plans remain relevant to the de-\ntermining the intent of the 2013 Legislature—and\npowerfully demonstrate improper legislative intent\nin 2013—for several reasons.\n\nFirst, under fundamental principles of statutory\ninterpretation, courts presume that legislatures are\naware of past legislative and judicial actions. Of par-\nticular relevance to this case,13 a legislature “is pre-\n\n13 Courts also presume that legislatures are aware of: other\nsubstantially similar statutes, see, e.g., Lockhart v. United",
        "25\n\nsumed to be aware of * * * [a] judicial interpretation\nof a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it\nre-enacts a statute without change.” Lorillard v.\nPons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978). Here, the Texas dis-\ntrict court held that the Texas Legislature adopted\nthe 2011 plan with a discriminatory purpose. And in\n2012, even after the Texas court adopted its interim\nplan, the District Court of the District of Columbia\nheld that the 2011 Texas congressional redistricting\nplan had been adopted with a discriminatory purpose\nand suggested in the strongest terms that the Texas\nHouse plan had been as well. Texas v. United States,\n887 F. Supp.2d 133, 159-166, 177-178 (D.D.C. 2012)\n(noting, regarding House plan, that “the full record\nstrongly suggest[s]”\nthe retrogressive effect\n“may not have been accidental”), vacated and re-\nmanded, 570 U.S. 928 (2013). Yet the Texas Legisla-\nture, aware of the holding that specific line-drawing\ndecisions had been taken for discriminatory purpos-\nes, left those same lines in place in 2013. This failure\nof Texas to alter the 2011 maps “following a contem-\nporaneous and practical\ninterpretation” that they\nwere racially discriminatory “is evidence of an intent\nto adopt such interpretation.” 2B Sutherland Stat-\nutes and Statutory Construction § 49:9 (7th ed. 2017).\n\nthat\n\nSecond, Texas claims that the court below “con-\nfuses discriminatory effect, which at least is capable\nof being carried over from one law to another, with\ndiscriminatory intent, which decidedly is not.” Texas\nBr. 17. But it is Texas that is confused. The argu-\nment here is not that the 2011 Legislature’s intent\n\nStates, 136 S. Ct. 958, 964 (2016); the common law, see, e.g.,\nSmith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 34 (1983); and longstanding agency\ninterpretations of statutes, see, e.g., FDA v. Brown & William-\nson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 156 (2000).",
        "26\n\nwas copied and pasted into to the 2013 legislation; it\nis that actors typically mean to accomplish the obvi-\nous and probable consequences of their actions, as\nTexas did when it left unchanged the discriminatory\ndistricts drawn by the Legislature in 2011. And “giv-\nen an initially tainted policy, it is eminently reason-\nable to make the State bear the risk of non-\npersuasion with respect to intent at some future\ntime, both because the State has created the dispute\nthrough its own unlawful conduct * * * and because\ndiscriminatory intent does tend to persist through\ntime.” United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 746-\n747 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring). That is particu-\nlarly so given the lengthy history of redistricting vio-\nlations in Texas, which should lead a court to view\nTexas’s current protestations of innocence with a\njaundiced eye: In every redistricting cycle since 1970,\nthis Court has found that Texas violated the VRA\nwith racially gerrymandered districts. See LULAC v.\nPerry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S.\n952 (1996); Upham v. Seamon, 456 U.S. 37 (1982);\nWhite v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783 (1973); White v.\nRegester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973).14\n\nThird, the State argues that any “claims against\nTexas’s 2011 redistricting plans became moot when\nthe 2013 Legislature repealed the 2011 plan.” Texas\nBr. 42 (internal quotation marks omitted). But this,\n\n14 Texas had the second highest number of VRA Section 5 objec-\ntions of any covered state. See Department of Justice, Voting\nDetermination Letters for Texas, perma.cc/3CK4-KDKB. In at\nleast 54 instances, Texas withdrew a proposed voting change\nafter it became clear that it would not be pre-cleared. See Nina\nPerales, Luis Figueroa & Criselda G. Rivas, Voting Rights in\nTexas: 1982-2006, 17 S. Cal. Rev. L. & Soc. Just. 713, 714\n(2008).",
        "27\n\nagain, is an exercise in misdirection. The claim here\nis not that the district court retained the power to\nenter judgment on the merits of the 2011 redistrict-\ning plans; it is that the discriminatory intent of the\n2011 plans remains relevant in assessing the validity\nof identical portions of the 2013 plans.\n\nFourth, even if it assumed that ending the litiga-\ntion was one of Texas’s motives,15 that is not the end\nof the matter. Appellees need not “prove that the\nchallenged action rested solely on [a] racially dis-\ncriminatory purpose[],” or even that it “was the ‘dom-\ninant’ or ‘primary’ one.” Village of Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at 265 (emphasis added). Instead, a redis-\ntricting plan violates the Equal Protection Clause if\nracial discrimination was a motivating factor. And\nhere, any hope that Texas entertained of ending this\nlitigation by adopting the district court’s interim\nplan was incidental to the Legislature’s larger (and\nclosely related) goal of insulating from further chal-\nlenge maps that discriminated against Latino voters.\n\nFifth, and perhaps most notably, the district\ncourt in fact found that Plan H358 was enacted with\na discriminatory purpose. Appellees recount the dis-\ntrict court’s findings in detail, showing that the Tex-\nas Legislature not only made no attempt to cure\nwhat the district court previously had found to be\n\n15 And that is a dubious assumption; the district court found\nthat the Texas Legislature “did not believe that passing the in-\nterim maps would end the litigation.” H.J.S. App. 358a n.45.\nRather, the Legislature knew that the “Plaintiffs would contin-\nue to pursue relief” as they had against the identical districts in\nPlan H283. Ibid. In fact, the court found that Texas Legislative\nCouncil Attorney Jeff Archer informed the legislators that “they\nhad not realistically removed legal challenges to the plans apart\nfrom those areas remedied by the interim plans.” Ibid.",
        "28\n\ndiscriminatory line-drawing, but “purposefully main-\ntained the intentional discrimination contained in\nPlan H283” (H.J.S. App. 6a); that “the 2013 Legisla-\nture intended to continue the intentional discrimina-\ntion found in Plan H283” (id. at 22a); that the Legis-\nlature in fact “intended any such taint to be main-\ntained but be safe from remedy” (id. at 359a); and\nthat the legislature acted with a strategy that was\n“discriminatory at its heart.” Ibid. As appellees also\nshow, this finding is reviewed under a highly defer-\nential standard. Appellees’ Br. 41-43. That finding is\namply supported by the record and bolstered by the\ngoverning legal principles. It should be affirmed.\n\n2. Texas had an affirmative duty to remove\n\nthe taint of racial discrimination.\n\nFinally, once a court determines that a state ac-\ntor has engaged in purposeful discrimination, the\n“racial discrimination [must] be eliminated root and\nbranch.” Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430,\n437-438 (1968). The proper remedy for an unconsti-\ntutional exclusion aims to “eliminate so far as possi-\nble the discriminatory effects of the past and to bar\nlike discrimination in the future.” United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 547 (1996) (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\nOnce the district court found racial discrimina-\ntion in the 2011 maps, the Texas Legislature was ob-\nligated to remove the discriminatory taint before en-\nacting new maps. Texas contends that the imposition\nof this requirement “reverse[s] the burden of proof\nentirely.” Texas Br. 31. But that is not so. We agree\nthat the ultimate burden of proof remains on the\nplaintiffs. But to return to Justice Thomas’s observa-\ntion, in these circumstances “it is eminently reason-\nable to make the State bear the risk of nonpersua-",
        "29\n\nsion.” Fordice, 505 U.S. at 746-747 (Thomas, J., con-\n(citations omitted). Whether or not the\ncurring)\nstandard is formulated “in terms of a burden shift\nwith respect to intent,” the factors the Court “do[es]\nconsider—the historical background of the policy, the\ndegree of its adverse impact, and the plausibility of\nany justification asserted in its defense—are precise-\nly those factors that go into determining intent under\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).” Id. at\n747.\n\nHere, the Texas Legislature “does not discharge\nits constitutional obligations until it eradicates poli-\ncies and practices traceable to its prior” discrimina-\ntory legislation. Fordice, 505 U.S. at 728. But Texas\nhas not “completely abandoned its prior [discrimina-\ntory] system.” Id. at 729. Instead, “the State perpet-\nuate[d] policies and practices traceable to its prior\nsystem that continue to have [discriminatory] ef-\nfects,”\nthe Equal Protection\nClause.” Id. at 732. Cf. Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1,\nDenver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 208 (1973) (“[A] finding\nof intentionally segregative school board actions” in\none portion of the school system “creates a presump-\ntion” that other actions have the same intent.).\n\n“run[ning] afoul of\n\nThe common sense of the matter is not really de-\nbatable. In 2011, the Texas Legislature drew maps\nfor the purpose of discriminating. Two years later,\nwhen given an opportunity to remedy this wrong,\nmany of the same legislators, guided by the same leg-\nislative leadership, put in place identical maps that\nwill have the same discriminatory effect. In this con-\ntext, the contention that discriminatory intent has\nsomehow fallen out of the case is, to quote Texas,\n“every bit as implausible as it sounds.” Texas Br. 1.",

Its membership now stands at 1.1 mil-\nlion people. Common Cause has, among other things,\nled the movement to lower the voting age to 18; and\nspearheaded the passage of freedom-of-information\nlaws, government ethics laws, and laws to limit the\ncorrupting influence of money in politics. Gerryman-\ndering is an issue of longstanding interest to Com-\nmon Cause at the national level and in its network of\n35 state organizations.\n\nAmicus Voting Rights Institute (VRI) is a first-of-\nits-kind legal institute established to help enforce\nand protect the rights of American voters. A joint\nproject of Georgetown University Law Center, the\nCampaign Legal Center, and the American Constitu-\ntion Society, VRI assists attorneys, expert witnesses,\nlaw students, and the public combat discriminatory\nvoting practices across the country. It offers oppor-\ntunities for students, recent graduates, and fellows\nto engage in litigation and policy work in the field of\nvoting rights and to educate attorneys about the\nskills and best practices of voting rights advocates. It\nalso recruits and trains expert witnesses to assist in\nlitigation development and presentation; promotes\nincreased local and national focus on voting rights\n\n1 Pursuant to this Court’s Rule 37.6, amici state that no counsel\nfor a party authored this brief in whole or in part and that no\nperson other than amici or their counsel made a monetary con-\ntribution to its preparation or submission. The parties have\nsubmitted blanket consents to the filing of amicus briefs in this\ncase.\n\n\f2\n\nthrough events, publications and the development of\nweb-based tools; and provides opportunities and plat-\nforms for research on voting rights.\n\nThis case involves the legality of voting districts\nthat the Texas Legislature originally created in 2011.\nAfter the district court invalidated those districts as\ndiscriminatory, the court in 2012 permitted use of\nsome of the districts on an interim basis, expressly\nnoting that its interim review had been limited and\nwas subject to revision. In 2013, the Texas Legisla-\nture re-enacted the same districts—those originally\nheld to be discriminatory—without change. Texas\nnow argues, in part, that adoption of the district\ncourt’s interim plan in 2012 effectively insulates the\n2013 plan from further review. Because this conten-\ntion threatens to subject Texas residents (and, if\nTexas’s theory prevails, residents of other States) to\ndiscriminatory voting regimes, and because amici\nhave considerable experience addressing issues that\nrelate to redistricting, amici submit this brief to as-\nsist the Court in the resolution of the case.\n\nINTRODUCTION AND\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nAppellees show in their briefs that the chal-\nlenged Texas districts were created with a discrimi-\nnatory purpose. That conclusion plainly is correct on\nthe record here: The Texas Legislature knew what it\nwas doing and intended the result when it drew dis-\ntricts that minimized minority voting strength.\n\nIn this brief, we focus on two particular, related\narguments that Texas and the United States ad-\nvance in defense of the challenged 2013 redistricting\nplans in an effort to avoid a conventional—and, from\n\n\f3\n\ntheir perspective, fatal—inquiry into legislative mo-\ntive.2 First, Texas maintains that the challenged\nplans here were “court-drawn” or “court imposed”\n(see, e.g., Texas Br. i; see also U.S. Br. 24) and that,\nnecessarily, the Legislature’s adoption of a plan that\nhad been validated by a federal court could not have\nbeen improper. And second, Texas insists that the\nimproper purpose that initially motivated adoption of\nPlan H283 in 2011 was somehow laundered out of\nPlan H358 when the Legislature created identical\ndistricts after the district court’s interim approval of\nthose districts in 2012.\n\nThese arguments are wrong. The districts chal-\nlenged here were discriminatory when the Texas\nLegislature created them in 2011. They had not mag-\nically lost their discriminatory purpose when the\nLegislature re-enacted the very same districts two\nyears later.\n\nA. Texas is incorrect when it maintains that the\ndistrict court validated the challenged districts, and\ninsulated them from review, when it permitted their\nuse in the 2012 interim plan. It is fundamental that\ncourts use different standards when issuing prelimi-\nnary or interim relief than they do when making a\nfinal determination on the merits. The need for ex-\npeditious review means that a preliminary ruling is\nissued on a limited record and with less than full\nconsideration; such a ruling is characterized by what\ncourts have called “its for-the-time-beingness.” The\n\n2 The arguments in this brief apply both to the Texas House\ndistricts incorporated in Plan H358 and to the congressional\ndistricts incorporated in Plan C235 that remained unchanged\nfrom Texas’s 2011 state house and congressional plans. For\nsimplicity’s sake, the brief principally discusses Plan H358.\n\n\f4\n\ndistrict court here emphasized that is just how it re-\ngarded its interim ruling, which it repeatedly said\nwas not definitive and was subject to revision. That\nruling does not establish the ultimate validity of the\nchallenged districts, and Texas could not reasonably\nhave relied on it for that purpose.\n\nB. The interim ruling also does not launder the\nTexas Legislature’s discriminatory purpose out of the\ncase. Texas now maintains that it adopted districts\nincluded in the interim plan simply to bring an expe-\nditious end to the redistricting litigation. But Texas’s\nstated motive is not the end of the matter: It remains\nthe Court’s duty to determine the Legislature’s actu-\nal intent when it chose to re-enact districts that had\nbeen held to be the product of a discriminatory pur-\npose. And here, all of the usual indicia of legislative\nintent—including the history, context, and prior ju-\ndicial constructions of the legislative language—\nsupport the district court’s finding that the Texas\nLegislature adopted the 2013 plan with a discrimina-\ntory purpose.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nA. The Texas Legislature initially drew the\ndistricts at issue here with a discriminatory\npurpose.\n\nAppellees address the history of the Texas plan\nat issue in this case in detail (Appellees’ Br. 2-253),\nand there is no need to repeat that presentation\nhere. But for purposes of the arguments addressed in\nthis brief, one element of the record warrants special\nemphasis: the district court’s findings regarding the\n\n3 References here to “Appellees’ Brief” are to appellees’ brief re-\nlating to the State House districts.\n\n\f5\n\ndiscriminatory intent that underlay the initial draw-\ning in 2011 of the Texas House districts at issue\nhere. Because it is the position of Texas and the\nUnited States that a plan using those same bounda-\nries was drawn with a benign intent just two years\nlater, it is helpful to bear in mind the specific find-\nings that led the district court to hold those districts\nto have been constructed with the specific purpose of\ndisadvantaging minority voters.\n\n1. In Nueces County, the district court found that\nthe cartographers acted “in bad faith” when they\neliminated HD33 as a Hispanic opportunity district.\nH.J.S. App. 133a. The court found that it was “un-\ndisputed that Nueces County had two benchmark\nLatino opportunity districts” before the 2010 redis-\ntricting cycle. Ibid. Legislators had “three options”\nfor how to district Nueces County: “(1) draw one ‘per-\nforming’ Hispanic district and one not; (2) draw two\nequally Hispanic districts, which may not perform\nreliably; or (3) see if both Latino opportunity districts\ncould be preserved by splitting county lines.” Id. at\n127a.4 The mapmakers pursued the first option, de-\nspite never “seriously look[ing] at whether § 2 [of the\nVoting Rights Act (“VRA”)] might require two oppor-\ntunity districts in Nueces County.” Id. at 127a n.22.\nInstead, they sought to “offset” the loss of HD33 as\nan opportunity district by adding more Latinos to\n\n4 The County Line Rule is a Texas constitutional requirement\nthat legislative districts “preserve whole counties when popula-\ntion mandates permit.” Tex. Const. art. III § 26. To the extent\nthe Texas Constitution conflicts with the Voting Rights Act,\nhowever, federal law controls.\n\n\f6\n\nHD90 and HD148—districts that were already elect-\ning minority candidates of choice. Ibid.5\n\nThe court found that the “redistricters knew”\nthat these two districts “were already ability dis-\ntricts, and thus that increasing their SSVR did not\ncreate any ‘new’ ability district to offset the loss of\nHD33.” H.J.S. App. 135a. Hence, the court found\nthat the true motive was “to intentionally dilute La-\ntino voting strength by * * * allowing redistricting\nleadership to claim that they were complying with\nthe VRA despite eliminating HD33 and creating no\nnew opportunity or ability districts.” Id. at 137a.\n\nfrom which the\n\nThe district court also found “evidence that the\nmapdrawers (including specifically Rep. Hunter) ra-\ncially gerrymandered the districts that remained in\nNueces County to further undermine Latino voting\nstrength.” H.J.S. App. 136a. The court noted that\n“[t]here are ten precinct splits along the HD32/HD34\ninferred that\nborder”\n“mapdrawers were likely using race to assign popu-\nlation since accurate political data is not available\nbelow the precinct level.” Ibid. The goal of these\nsplits, according to the district court, was to “inten-\ntionally pack[] Hispanic voters into HD32 to mini-\nmize their number and influence in HD34” to protect\nthe Republican incumbent. Ibid. The court also found\nevidence that the mapdrawers “targeted low turnout\n\ncourt\n\n5 The district court also found that the mapmakers intentional-\nly relied on Spanish Surname Voter Registration (“SSVR”) as a\nmeasure of the relevant Latino population in Nueces County,\neven though they knew that Hispanic Citizen Voting Age Popu-\nlation (“HCVAP”) was the more appropriate measure, because\n“SSVR was lower (and lower than 50%), and it allowed them to\nargue that mathematically, two SSVR-majority districts could\nnot be drawn.” H.J.S. App 134a.\n\n\f7\n\nminority areas” for inclusion in HD34 to protect the\nRepublican incumbent. Ibid. Finally, the court found\nevidence that the mapmakers intentionally overpop-\nulated HD32 (and underpopulated HD34), without a\nlegitimate justification for doing so. Ibid. All of these\nfindings contributed to the conclusion that the Texas\nLegislature had engaged in intentional vote dilution.\n\n2. The district court found that in Dallas County,\nthe mapdrawers intended to “dilute minority voting\nstrength to protect a Republican incumbent\nin\nHD105 by intentionally making the district more\nAnglo.” H.J.S. App. 170a. The court found that the\n“Anglo population decreased by 198,000 in Dallas\nCounty” even while the population of Dallas County\nas a whole grew by 350,000. Id. at 261a. As such, the\nmapmakers knew that two of the three districts in\nDallas County would have to be minority districts.\nSee id. at 171a. As one advisor to the mapmakers\nexplained, however,\nit might “get ‘worse’ because\nthey might have to draw a third Latino district,\nwhich would mean the loss of a third Republican\nseat.” Ibid. But instead of “exploring whether any\nadditional minority districts could be drawn or main-\ntained to recognize the population growth,”\nthe\nmapmakers decided to pack as many Latino voters\nas possible into the two minority districts and there-\nfore “eliminated districts that were on track to per-\nform for minority voters.” Ibid.\n\nIn fact, one of the redistricters “admitted to split-\nting precincts to put the Hispanic population into\nHD104 and HD103 and the Anglo population in\nHD105.” H.J.S. App. 171a. Although this legislator\nclaimed that he took this step to comply with the\nVRA, the district court found “that this was yet an-\nother example of mapdrawers using superficial com-\n\n\f8\n\npliance with the VRA to dilute minority voting\nstrength rather than enhancing it.” Ibid. By doing\nso, the Legislature made it less likely that Latinos\nwould elect their candidate of choice in HD105. Id. at\n261a & n.35. Hence, the district court found that the\nLegislature’s “true motive was to dilute Latino voting\nstrength in west Dallas County by unnecessarily\nplacing Latinos” into two already Latino districts to\nmake HD105 more Anglo, and more strongly protec-\ntive of the incumbent Republican. Id. at 172a. The\ndistrict court concluded that this strategy was inten-\ntional discrimination in violation of the VRA.\n\n3. The mapmakers split the City of Killeen in\nBell County, a paradigmatic community of interest,\nbetween two districts “to ensure that” those districts\n“remained Anglo-majority, and would reelect Repub-\nlican incumbents.” H.J.S. App. 183a. The district\ncourt found that “the evidence does indicate that\nmapdrawers * * * intentionally racially gerryman-\ndered the districts to dilute the minority vote by\nmoving minority population out of HD54 and moving\nAnglo population in.” Id. at 181a. Thus, the court\nconcluded that mapmakers swapped minority and\nAnglo communities to make “it more difficult for mi-\nnority voters in HD54 to elect their candidate of\nchoice.” Ibid.\n\nThe court reached this conclusion because it\nfound the reasons offered by the mapmaker who split\nKilleen “not credible.” H.J.S. App. 182a-183a. That\nrepresentative testified that he believed some areas\nin Bell County had more in common with a neighbor-\ning county. Id. at 182a. The court, however, rejected\nthat reasoning as “pretextual” cover for his intent to\n“crack[] and dilut[e] the minority vote to ensure An-\nglo control over both districts.” Id. at 181a. Specifi-\n\n\f9\n\ncally, although the mapmaker opposed an alternative\nmap that would have kept Killeen whole because it\nhad a “land bridge” that connected Killeen to other\ncommunities, “Plan H283 includes land bridges in\nother areas and he voted for it.” Id. at 182a-183a.\nThe court concluded that the legislator was motivat-\ned by the knowledge that “a minority coalition dis-\ntrict [such as Killeen] would not likely have enough\nRepublicans to re-elect him.” Id. at 182a.\n\nAccordingly, the background of the current con-\ntroversy is clear and, for present purposes, essential-\nly undisputed. The Texas Legislature drew the par-\nticular districts that we address for the specific, race-\nconscious purpose of disadvantaging Latino voters.\nThe State’s arguments to the contrary, the district\ncourt found, were pretextual. The question now is\nwhether these findings of improper intent have any\nbearing on the Texas Legislature’s motive in placing\nthe same districts in a plan it enacted two years lat-\ner.\n\nB. Texas’s attempt to equate preliminary find-\nings with a final decision on the merits is\nunavailing.\n\nIn defending districts that initially were drawn\nfor these manifestly improper purposes, Texas insists\nthat the district lines used in Plan H358 must be val-\nid because the district court approved the same lines\nin the interim plan it set in 2012. As Texas would\nhave it, that approval means that the challenged dis-\ntricts should be treated as court-drawn, so that the\ndistrict court, in the decision below, found that “its\nown maps were infected with the ‘taint of discrimina-\n\n\f10\n\ntory intent.’” Texas Br. 1 (emphasis in original).6\nThis contention is central to the State’s case; as ap-\npellees note (Appellees’ Br. 1), Texas repeats the as-\nsertion that the challenged plan is “court-drawn” or\n“court imposed” at least eleven times throughout its\nbrief.\n\nThis facially improbable contention, however, is\nwrong. The district court’s avowedly preliminary and\ninterim approval of the challenged districts—a prod-\nuct of exigent circumstances and severe time con-\nstraints—was not intended to be, and could not rea-\nsonably have been taken by Texas legislators to have\nbeen intended as, an endorsement of the ultimate va-\nlidity of these districts. In fact, Texas’s novel theory\ndisregards not only the plain meaning of “prelimi-\nnary” and “interim,” but also this Court’s long-\nstanding precedent and the Federal Rules’ estab-\nlished procedures for combining preliminary and fi-\nnal relief. Plan H358 was not the district court’s\nplan; it was the Texas Legislature’s plan. The reality\nis that all the districts at issue were drawn by the\nLegislature, some in 2011 and the rest in 2013.\n\n1. A preliminary injunction is not a decision\n\non the merits.\n\na. Texas’s argument is premised on the assump-\ninterim\ntion that the district court’s preliminary,\nplan reflects the court’s judgment that the districts\nincluded in that plan express an ultimate judgment\nthat these districts are valid. But that plainly is not\nso. As this Court has long recognized, “the findings of\nfact and conclusions of law made by a court granting\n\n6 The United States is more restrained in its characterizations,\nbut does refer to the plan as the court’s “own.” U.S. Br. 24.\n\n\f11\n\na preliminary injunction are not binding at trial on\nthe merits.” University of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451\nU.S. 390, 395 (1981). Although district courts “should\nmake the findings of fact and conclusions of law that\nare appropriate to the interlocutory proceeding,” the-\nse findings must not be treated as a “decision * * * on\nthe merits.” Public Serv. Comm’n of Wis. v. Wis. Tel.\nCo., 289 U.S. 67, 71 (1933).\n\nIt is because “the necessity for an expeditious\nresolution often means that the injunction is issued\non a procedure less stringent than that which pre-\nvails at the subsequent trial” that preliminary in-\njunctions are not final. Thornburgh v. American Coll.\nof Obstetricians & Gynecologists, 476 U.S. 747, 755-\n756 (1986), overruled on other grounds by Planned\nParenthood of Se. Pa. v. Casey, 505 U.S. 833 (1992).\nOn later review, a court may reverse some or all of\nits initial findings based on a more fully developed\nrecord and greater time for deliberation. Thus, “any\nconclusions reached at the preliminary injunction\nstage are subject to revision.” Walters v. National\nAss’n of Radiation Survivors, 473 U.S. 305, 317\n(1985) (citing Camenisch, 451 U.S. at 395).\n\nThis principle has never been in doubt. As re-\ncently as last Term,\nthe Court affirmed that\n“[c]rafting a preliminary injunction is an exercise of\ndiscretion and judgment,” the purpose of which “is\nnot to conclusively determine the rights of the par-\nties, but to balance the equities as the litigation\nmoves forward.” Trump v. International Refugee As-\nsistance Project, 137 S. Ct. 2080, 2087 (2017) (inter-\nnal citations omitted). The Court has made clear that\nthe same standard governs a district court’s decision\nto accept or depart from elements of a State’s pro-\n\n\f12\n\nposed redistricting plan when “drafting an interim\nplan.” Perry v. Perez, 132 S. Ct. 934, 941-942 (2012).\n\nb. Lower courts have consistently recognized the\n“significant differences between a preliminary in-\njunction and a permanent injunction or other final\ndisposition on the merits.” Zen Music Festivals,\nL.L.C. v. Stewart, 72 F. App’x 168, 170 (5th Cir.\n2003); see also Ben. Pension Tr. v. United States, 888\nF.2d 1111, 1114 (6th Cir. 1989) (collecting cases).\nThese holdings have special relevance here: they\ndrive home what the district court in this case meant\nby its interim ruling—and that Texas surely recog-\nnized, both at that time and when it adopted Plan\nH358, that the interim ruling was not a definitive\nresolution of the propriety of the districts approved\nby the district court for temporary use in 2012.\n\nThus, as Judge Jerome Frank wrote for the Se-\ncond Circuit more than 60 years ago, a “preliminary\ninjunction * * * is, by its very nature, interlocutory,\ntentative, provisional, ad interim, impermanent, mu-\ntable, not fixed or final or conclusive, [and] charac-\nterized by its\nfor-the-time-beingness.” Hamilton\nWatch Co. v. Benrus Watch Co., 206 F.2d 738, 742\n(2d Cir. 1953); see also 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions\n§ 276 (2018) (explaining that preliminary injunctions\n“by their very nature are interlocutory, tentative,\nand impermanent”).\n\nAccordingly, preliminary findings of\n\nfact and\nconclusions of law have “no binding effect whatsoev-\ner.” Clark v. K-Mart Corp., 979 F.2d 965, 969 (3d Cir.\n1992) (citing Camenisch, 451 U.S. at 395-396)); see\nalso Industrial Bank of Wash. v. Tobriner, 405 F.2d\n1321, 1324 (D.C. Cir. 1968) (explaining that such\nfindings “should not be regarded as binding in fur-\nther proceedings”). This is because such proceedings\n\n\f13\n\nare “based upon procedures that are less formal and\nevidence that is less complete than in a full trial.”\nTechnical Publ’g Co. v. Lebhar-Friedman, Inc., 729\nF.2d 1136, 1139 (7th Cir. 1984).\n\n2. The district court emphasized the limited\n\nnature of its holding.\n\na. That rule governs in this case. Facing extreme\nlimits on its ability to conduct a full review, the dis-\ntrict court repeatedly “emphasize[d] the preliminary\nand temporary nature” of the 2012 interim map.\nH.J.S. App. 314a. Contrary to Texas’s representa-\ntions, the district court stressed that “nothing in this\nopinion reflects this Court’s final determination of\nany legal or factual matters.” Id. 303a (emphasis\nadded).\n\nLittle wonder why; the court was operating un-\nder “severe time constraints.” H.J.S. App. 356a. With\nbarely more than a month to develop its plan, the\ncourt was forced to make preliminary findings on an\nincomplete and underdeveloped record.7 Due to the\n\n7 The resolution of complex redistricting cases almost always\ntakes more time than the district court was able to devote to\nconsideration of the interim challenge in this case. The average\ntime from trial to disposition of a redistricting case in the Fifth\nCircuit is five months. See, e.g., Rodriguez v. Harris Cty., 964 F.\nSupp. 2d 686 (S.D. Tex 2013) (8.5 months from trial to conclu-\nsion that there was no Section 2 violation); Fairley v. City of\nHattiesburg, 122 F. Supp. 3d 553 (S.D. Miss. 2015) (9.5 months\nfrom trial to conclusion that there was no Section 2 violation);\nFabela v. City of Farmers Branch, No. 3:10-CV-1425-D (N.D.\nTex. Jan. 1, 2013) (6 months from trial to implementation of\nnew plan to remedy Section 2 violations); Hall v. Louisiana, 108\nF. Supp. 3d 119 (M.D. La. 2015) (6.5 months from trial to con-\nclusion that there was no Section 2 violation); Terrebonne Par.\nBranch NAACP v. Jindal, 274 F. Supp. 3d 395 (M.D. La. 2017)\n(3.5 months from trial to conclusion that there was a Section 2\n\n\f14\n\n“exigent circumstances created by the need for timely\n2012 primaries and general elections in Texas” (id.\nat 303a), the court was not able to—and indeed, did\nnot try to—adjudicate the merits. The court simply\ndid the best that it could, while “warn[ing] repeated-\nly that its determinations could change after a full\ntrial on the merits.” Id. at 356a n.42. This is, indeed,\na ruling characterized by its “for-the-time-being-\nness.”\n\nb. Preliminary injunctions are preliminary for\nthis very reason. Courts must make fast determina-\ntions on relatively little information. Faced with such\nrecord and time constraints, “[i]t is universally true\nthat courts are more willing to grant permanent in-\njunctions than preliminary injunctions.” Douglas A.\nLaycock, The Death of the Irreparable Injury Rule,\n103 Harv. L. Rev. 687, 731 (1990). And “[p]relim-\ninary injunctions are * * * often denied in substan-\ntive areas where all injury is irreparable and perma-\nnent injunctions are routine, such as * * * civil rights\nand civil liberties.” Id. at 732 (footnote omitted). As\nremedies scholars have explained, “[t]he reasons a\ncourt may be cautious in awarding preliminary relief\nare clear. The court must act without a full trial,\nsometimes with only sketchy motion papers and affi-\ndavits to guide its decision.” Id. at 728; see also Lin-\nda J. Silberman, Injunctions by the Numbers: Less\n\nviolation, with the issue of a remedial map still pending); Be-\nnavidez v. Irving Indep. Sch. Dist., No. 3:13-CV-0087-D (N.D.\nTex. Oct. 20, 2014) (2.5 months from trial to implementation of\na new plan to remedy Section 2 violation); York v. City of St.\nGabriel, 89 F. Supp. 3d 843 (M.D. La. 2015) (2 months from tri-\nal to conclusion that there was no Section 2 violation); Patino v.\nCity of Pasenda, 230 F. Supp. 3d 667 (S.D. Tex. 2017) (1 month\nfrom trial to implementation of interim map to remedy Section\n2 violation).\n\n\f15\n\nThan the Sum of Its Parts, 63 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 279,\n300-301 (1987) (“[B]ecause of the preliminary nature\nof the relief and the expedited nature of the proceed-\ning, there is often not a fully developed factual rec-\nord. The district judge is often acting more on hunch,\nprobability, and speculation than he would be in a\nfull-scale trial\nfor permanent relief.”). Therefore,\ncourts rarely grant full injunctive relief at the pre-\nliminary stage.\n\nIt is thus no surprise that the district court\ngranted only partial relief here. Acting under severe\nrecord and time constraints—and mindful of the cost\nto the State—the court invalidated only some of the\nchallenged districts. Later, with the full record in\nhand and time for reflection, the court invalidated\nadditional districts.\n\nThis again should come as no surprise to Texas.\nCourts reverse their determinations between the pre-\nliminary and final stages of litigation all the time.\nDistrict courts frequently deny preliminary relief on-\nly to grant permanent relief,8 and vice versa.9 Appel-\n\n8 See, e.g., United Motorcoach Ass’n, Inc. v. City of Austin, 851\nF.3d 489, 492 (5th Cir. 2017) (discussing a district court perma-\nnently enjoining the enforcement of a city regulation, despite\ndenial of preliminary relief); Public Interest Research Grp. v.\nPowell Duffryn Terminals Inc., 913 F.2d 64, 69-70 (3d Cir.\n1990) (discussing a district court permanently enjoining the de-\nfendant from violating a Clean Water Act permit, despite denial\nof preliminary relief); Nalpac, Ltd. v. Corning Glass Works, 784\nF.2d 752, 753-754 (6th Cir. 1986) (discussing a district court\npermanently enjoining the defendant from use of a trademark,\ndespite denial of preliminary relief); Bynes v. Toll, 512 F.2d\n252, 253 (2d Cir. 1975) (discussing a district court permanently\nenjoining the defendant-university from enforcing a discrimina-\ntory residency agreement, despite denial of preliminary relief).\n\n\f16\n\nlate courts likewise reverse preliminary injunctions\nonly to later affirm permanent ones.10 Preliminary\nrelief is, by its very nature, temporary. There is noth-\ning strange or untoward about the district court re-\nvising its initial determinations in light of a finished\nrecord and time for considered judgment. Texas can-\nnot claim that its plans were upset by an ordinary\nreversal of fortunes, of the sort litigants routinely\nface.\n\nc. Texas unsuccessfully attempts to shrink the\ngap between preliminary and final relief by suggest-\ning that\nthe district court applied “a standard\nuniquely favorable to plaintiffs.” Reply Supporting\nH.J.S. 6 (emphasis omitted). This argument misun-\nderstands the governing standard.\n\nThat standard is pro “status quo” (42 Am. Jur. 2d\nInjunctions § 9), not pro-plaintiff. A preliminary in-\njunction is an “extraordinary remedy” (Winter v.\nNRDC, 555 U.S. 7, 24 (2008)), enacted “merely to\npreserve the relative positions of the parties until a\n\n9 See, e.g., Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 77 (2007) (addressing\nwhether “a plaintiff who gains a preliminary injunction after an\nabbreviated hearing, but is denied a permanent injunction after\na dispositive adjudication on the merits, qualif[ies] as a ‘prevail-\ning party’” for attorneys’ fees purposes); Common Cause/Geor-\ngia v. Billups, 554 F.3d 1340, 1347-1348 (11th Cir. 2009) (deny-\ning a permanent injunction in a voter ID law case, despite the\nissuance of preliminary relief).\n\n10 Compare Los Angeles Mem’l Coliseum Comm'n v. National\nFootball League, 634 F.2d 1197, 1204 (9th Cir. 1980) (reversing\na preliminary injunction, because plaintiffs had not shown a\nlikelihood of irreparable injury), with Los Angeles Mem'l Coli-\nseum Comm’n v. National Football League, 726 F.2d 1381, 1401\n(9th Cir. 1984) (affirming a permanent injunction in the same\ncase, because plaintiffs had shown irreparable injury during the\ntrial).\n\n\f17\n\ntrial on the merits can be held.” Camenisch, 451 U.S.\nat 395. The purpose of the standard is to “balance the\nequities” (Trump, 137 S. Ct. at 2087) and preserve\nthe litigating positions of the parties for trial. For\nthat reason, “[a]n injunction is considered an ex-\ntraordinary remedy that should be exercised sparing-\nly and cautiously.” 42 Am. Jur. 2d Injunctions § 17\n(footnotes omitted). Here, that standard militated in\nfavor of the court preserving for interim use the dis-\ntrict boundaries initially drawn by the Texas Legis-\nlature.\n\nTexas’s arguments thus misstate the standard. It\nis no surprise that the district court denied the plain-\ntiffs full relief on a slim record and under extreme\ntime pressure. Texas cannot shield its map from fur-\nther constitutional review in reliance on relief that\nwas, by its very nature, ephemeral and extraordi-\nnary.\n\n3. Texas cannot evade review by relying on\n\nthe court’s interim findings.\n\nAgainst this background, Texas could not rea-\nsonably have believed that the district court’s inter-\nim findings established the ultimate validity of the\ndistricts incorporated in the 2012 plan. The State’s\ncurrent suggestion that it expected use of districts\npermitted by the interim plan to end the redistrict-\ning litigation therefore simply is not plausible.\n\na. Courts have long cautioned litigants against\nplacing too much faith in preliminary findings. In\ncircumstances generally similar to those here, the\nSecond Circuit recently chided a state university for\nrelying on statements in an order granting prelimi-\nnary relief. As the Second Circuit explained:\n\n\f18\n\n[The university]—or certainly its able coun-\nsel—surely knew the risks of such reliance.\n“A decision on a preliminary injunction is, in\neffect, only a prediction about the merits of\nthe case,” thus, “findings of fact and conclu-\nsions of law made by a court granting a pre-\nliminary injunction are not binding,” and “do\nnot preclude reexamination of the merits at a\nsubsequent trial.”\n\nBiediger v. Quinnipiac Univ., 691 F.3d 85, 107 (2d\nCir. 2012) (quoting Morris v. Hoffa, 361 F.3d 177,\n189 (3d Cir. 2004); Camenisch, 451 U.S. at 395; and\nIrish Lesbian & Gay Org. v. Giuliani, 143 F.3d 638,\n644 (2d Cir.1998)).\n\nCourts have likewise rejected similar reliance\narguments by patent litigants. Defendants in a re-\ncent pharmaceutical case contended that they rea-\nsonably relied on the court’s denial of preliminary re-\nlief in issuing a competing product. The court reject-\ned this argument: “Although Defendants did not\nlaunch their generic product until after the prelimi-\nnary injunction was denied, the preliminary injunc-\ntion was, by definition, preliminary and not a final\nruling on the validity of the * * * patent.” Sanofi-\nAventis Deutschland GmbH v. Glenmark Pharms.\nInc., 821 F. Supp. 2d 681, 695 (D.N.J. 2011), aff’d\nand remanded, 748 F.3d 1354 (Fed. Cir. 2014).\n\nb. Appellate courts have similarly cautioned dis-\ntrict courts against overreliance on their own prelim-\ninary findings.\n\nAs the Seventh Circuit has explained, “exclu-\nsive[]” reliance on preliminary findings “can be a\nrisky approach. A court must be cautious in adopting\nfindings and conclusions from the preliminary in-\n\n\f19\n\njunction stage in ruling on a motion for summary\njudgment.” Communications Maint., Inc. v. Motorola,\nInc., 761 F.2d 1202, 1205 (7th Cir. 1985); see also\nLac Du Flambeau Band of Lake Superior Chippewa\nIndians v. Stop Treaty Abuse-Wis., Inc., 991 F.2d\n1249, 1258 (7th Cir. 1993) (“[W]e have advised dis-\ntrict courts to be cautious in [subsequently] adopting\nconclusions of law made in ruling on a preliminary\ninjunction because the posture of the case at that\ntime inevitably entails incomplete evidentiary mate-\nrials and hurried consideration of the issues.”).\n\nAppellate courts thus frequently reverse grants\nof summary judgment where the district court im-\nproperly relied on denial of preliminary relief to jus-\ntify summary judgment. For example, the Sixth Cir-\ncuit reversed where the district court concluded that\nthe “magistrate’s recommendation denying the ap-\npellant’s motion for a preliminary injunction, as\nadopted by the district court, was dispositive of the\nsummary judgment motion.” William G. Wilcox,\nD.O., P.C. Employees’ Defined Benefit Pension Tr. v.\nUnited States, 888 F.2d 1111, 1113 (6th Cir. 1989).\nAs the court explained, “a trial court’s disposition of\nthe substantive issues joined on a motion for ex-\ntraordinary relief is not dispositive of those substan-\ntive issues on the merits.” Id. at 1114. Other appel-\nlate courts agree,11 as do the leading treatises. See,\n\n11 See, e.g., Golden State Transit Corp. v. City of Los Ange-\nles, 754 F.2d 830, 832 n.3 (9th Cir.1985) (“As a general rule, de-\ncisions on preliminary injunctions do not constitute law of the\ncase and ‘parties are free to litigate the merits.’”) (quoting City\nof Anaheim v. Duncan, 658 F.2d 1326, 1328 n.2 (9th Cir.\n1981), rev’d on other grounds, 475 U.S. 608 (1986)); Berrigan v.\nSigler, 499 F.2d 514, 518 (D.C. Cir. 1974) (“The decision of a\ntrial or appellate court whether to grant or deny a preliminary\n\n\f20\n\ne.g., 18 C. Wright, A. Miller & E. Cooper, Federal\nPractice & Procedure § 4478 (1981) (“Rulings that\nsimply deny extraordinary relief for want of a clear\nand strong showing on the merits, or that are avow-\nedly preliminary or tentative, do not trigger law of\nthe case consequences.”).\n\n4. There is a procedure for combining pre-\nliminary hearings with a decision on the\nmerits, but it was not used here.\n\nTexas’s reliance on preliminary findings is not\nonly wrong; it ignores an established procedure for\ncombining preliminary relief with a final decision on\nthe merits. Neither the district court nor Texas pur-\nsued this procedure here.\n\nFederal Rule of Civil Procedure 65(a)(2) sets out\na process for combining preliminary and final relief:\n“Before or after beginning the hearing on a motion\nfor a preliminary injunction, the court may advance\nthe trial on the merits and consolidate it with the\nhearing.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(a)(2).\n\nThis procedure requires advance notice to the\n\nparties. As this Court has explained:\n\nBefore such an order may issue, however, the\ncourts have commonly required that “the\nparties should normally receive clear and\nunambiguous notice [of the court’s intent to\nconsolidate the trial and the hearing] either\nbefore the hearing commences or at a time\n\ninjunction * * * does not limit or preclude the parties from liti-\ngating the merits * * * . [S]uch rulings [do] not preclude the dis-\ntrict court, nor should they dissuade us, from taking a fresh\nlook.”) (footnotes omitted).\n\n\f21\n\nwhich will still afford the parties a full oppor-\ntunity to present their respective cases.\n\nCamenisch, 451 U.S. at 395 (quoting Pughsley v.\n3750 Lake Shore Drive Coop. Bldg., 463 F.2d 1055,\n1057 (7th Cir. 1972)).\n\nIf the Rule 65(a)(2) process is not specifically in-\nvoked, it is generally improper to adopt findings from\na preliminary hearing at the merits stage without\nadditional explanation. See, e.g., Sanchez v. Esso\nStandard Oil Co., 572 F.3d 1, 15 (1st Cir. 2009).\n“When a trial court ‘disposes of a case on the merits\nafter a preliminary-injunction hearing without ex-\npressly ordering consolidation * * * it is likely that\none or more of the parties will not [have] present[ed]\ntheir entire case at [the] unconsolidated preliminary-\ninjunction hearing.’ Therefore, it is ordinarily im-\nproper to decide a case solely on such a basis.” Ibid.\n(quoting\n11A C. Wright, A. Miller, & E.\nKane, Federal Practice and Procedure § 2950 (2009)).\n\nAccordingly, the controlling principle is clear:\npreliminary findings of fact and conclusions of law\nare far from final. Litigants rely on such determina-\ntions at their peril, and the district court here would\nhave erred had it found that its interim plan insulat-\ned the districts utilized in that plan from further re-\nview—that is, if it had done what Texas now says it\nshould have done. That the Texas Legislature took\naccount of the interim plan in 2013 when it drew\nPlan H358 may bear on the Legislature’s intent at\nthat time, but the existence of the plan cannot be a\nmagic bullet that wins the case for the State or eras-\nes the intent that actually underlay the 201 plan..\n\n\f22\n\nC.\n\nInterim court approval of districts created\nwith a discriminatory purpose does not\nlaunder out the discrimination when those\nsame districts are re-enacted.\n\nTexas also makes a closely related argument\nfrom the district court’s promulgation of the interim\nplan. As Texas tells the story, the court blessed the\ndistricts challenged here, in the process laundering\nout the discriminatory intent of the 2011 Legislature.\nThe Legislature’s adoption of the interim plan, the\nstory continues, then effectively became implementa-\ntion of a benign court-ordered plan rather than re-\nenactment of a discriminatory one. Texas Br. 36 (ar-\nguing that 2013 plan adopted simply to “bring exist-\ning litigation to an end”); see U.S. Br. 41. But this\nstory is a tall tale. Texas’s purported reliance on the\ndistrict court’s blessing cannot end the inquiry; the\nLegislature’s actual intent remains subject to in-\nquiry.\n\nThat determination “demands a sensitive inquiry\ninto * * * circumstantial and direct evidence of in-\ntent.” Village of Arlington Heights v. Metropolitan\nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 266 (1977). It has\nlong been understood that evidence a court may con-\nsider in assessing legislative intent includes such\nconsiderations as (1) any disparate impact on the\nprotected class; (2) “[t]he historical background of the\ndecision * * * particularly if it reveals a series of offi-\ncial actions taken for invidious purposes”; (3) “[t]he\nspecific sequence of events leading up to the chal-\nlenged decision”; and (4) the “legislative or adminis-\ntrative history.” Id. at 266-268 (citations omitted).\nAnd a closer “examination of the legislative scheme\nand its history demonstrates” that Texas’s motive in\nenacting the 2013 redistricting maps was, in fact, to\n\n\f23\n\ndisadvantage minority voters. Weinberger v. Wiesen-\nfeld, 420 U.S. 636, 648 n.16 (1975).12\n\n1. Texas’s real motive was to re-enact the\n\ndiscriminatory 2011 maps.\n\nIn characterizing the legislative motive, Texas’s\ncentral argument appears to be that, in re-enacting\nthe district court’s interim plan, the Texas Legisla-\nture’s intent was simply to adopt a court-approved\nplan as a way to end the redistricting litigation, thus\nrendering irrelevant the 2011 plan (and the associat-\ned finding of improper motive). But the State’s asser-\ntion of this anodyne intent cannot be the end of the\nstory.\n\nAs the Court has held, “the mere recitation of a\nbenign[] * * * purpose is not an automatic shield\nwhich protects against any inquiry into the actual\npurposes underlying a statutory scheme.” Wiesenfeld,\n420 U.S. at 648. That the Texas Legislature chose to\n\n12 Even accepting the State’s counter-factual premise that Tex-\nas simply implemented a court-ordered plan in 2013 would not\nend the inquiry. Court-ordered plans may themselves violate\nthe Constitution or the Voting Rights Act. See, e.g., Connor v.\nFinch, 431 U.S. 407 (1977) (overturning a court-ordered reap-\nportionment plan for failing to meet “one-person, one vote”);\nChapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975) (same). And when a\nlegislature adopts a court’s plan, the plan is still subject to sub-\nstantive review. For example, under the Voting Rights Act,\n“[e]ven in the[] cases” where a court orders a plan, “if the gov-\nernmental body subsequently adopts a plan patterned after the\ncourt’s plan, Section 5 review would be required.” See McDaniel\nv. Sanchez, 452 U.S. 130, 149 (1981). Whenever a legislature\n“submits a proposal reflecting the policy choices of the elected\nrepresentatives of the people—no matter what constraints have\nlimited the choices available to them,” substantive review is\navailable. Id. at 153.\n\n\f24\n\ninclude in its permanent plan districts that the dis-\ntrict court had approved for interim use says nothing\nabout the Legislature’s actual motive in making that\nchoice; as with any statute, the 2013 redistricting\nplan is subject to examination under the ordinary\nstandards used to determine legislative intent. See\nU.S. Br. 25 (citing Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. 541,\n549 (1999)). Here, that inquiry leaves no doubt that\nTexas’s real motive in 2013 was not to codify the\n2012 interim plans or to avoid litigation; it was to\nleave the discriminatory 2011 maps in place.\n\nBy asking the Court to completely disregard the\n2011 redistricting maps, Texas seeks to have its in-\ntent evaluated “only from the latest news about the\nlast in a series of governmental actions.” McCreary\nCty. v. ACLU, 545 U.S. 844, 866 (2005). “But,” as the\nCourt has stated, “the world is not made brand new\nevery morning.” Ibid. In arguing to the contrary,\nTexas is “simply asking [the Court] to ignore perfect-\nly probative evidence.” Ibid. In assessing legislative\npurpose, however, the Court is not “an absentminded\nobjective observer,” but one “presumed to be familiar\nwith the history of the government’s actions and\ncompetent to learn what history has to show.” Ibid.\n\nIn fact, the 2011 plans remain relevant to the de-\ntermining the intent of the 2013 Legislature—and\npowerfully demonstrate improper legislative intent\nin 2013—for several reasons.\n\nFirst, under fundamental principles of statutory\ninterpretation, courts presume that legislatures are\naware of past legislative and judicial actions. Of par-\nticular relevance to this case,13 a legislature “is pre-\n\n13 Courts also presume that legislatures are aware of: other\nsubstantially similar statutes, see, e.g., Lockhart v. United\n\n\f25\n\nsumed to be aware of * * * [a] judicial interpretation\nof a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it\nre-enacts a statute without change.” Lorillard v.\nPons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978). Here, the Texas dis-\ntrict court held that the Texas Legislature adopted\nthe 2011 plan with a discriminatory purpose. And in\n2012, even after the Texas court adopted its interim\nplan, the District Court of the District of Columbia\nheld that the 2011 Texas congressional redistricting\nplan had been adopted with a discriminatory purpose\nand suggested in the strongest terms that the Texas\nHouse plan had been as well. Texas v. United States,\n887 F. Supp.2d 133, 159-166, 177-178 (D.D.C. 2012)\n(noting, regarding House plan, that “the full record\nstrongly suggest[s]”\nthe retrogressive effect\n“may not have been accidental”), vacated and re-\nmanded, 570 U.S. 928 (2013). Yet the Texas Legisla-\nture, aware of the holding that specific line-drawing\ndecisions had been taken for discriminatory purpos-\nes, left those same lines in place in 2013. This failure\nof Texas to alter the 2011 maps “following a contem-\nporaneous and practical\ninterpretation” that they\nwere racially discriminatory “is evidence of an intent\nto adopt such interpretation.” 2B Sutherland Stat-\nutes and Statutory Construction § 49:9 (7th ed. 2017).\n\nthat\n\nSecond, Texas claims that the court below “con-\nfuses discriminatory effect, which at least is capable\nof being carried over from one law to another, with\ndiscriminatory intent, which decidedly is not.” Texas\nBr. 17. But it is Texas that is confused. The argu-\nment here is not that the 2011 Legislature’s intent\n\nStates, 136 S. Ct. 958, 964 (2016); the common law, see, e.g.,\nSmith v. Wade, 461 U.S. 30, 34 (1983); and longstanding agency\ninterpretations of statutes, see, e.g., FDA v. Brown & William-\nson Tobacco Corp., 529 U.S. 120, 156 (2000).\n\n\f26\n\nwas copied and pasted into to the 2013 legislation; it\nis that actors typically mean to accomplish the obvi-\nous and probable consequences of their actions, as\nTexas did when it left unchanged the discriminatory\ndistricts drawn by the Legislature in 2011. And “giv-\nen an initially tainted policy, it is eminently reason-\nable to make the State bear the risk of non-\npersuasion with respect to intent at some future\ntime, both because the State has created the dispute\nthrough its own unlawful conduct * * * and because\ndiscriminatory intent does tend to persist through\ntime.” United States v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 746-\n747 (1992) (Thomas, J., concurring). That is particu-\nlarly so given the lengthy history of redistricting vio-\nlations in Texas, which should lead a court to view\nTexas’s current protestations of innocence with a\njaundiced eye: In every redistricting cycle since 1970,\nthis Court has found that Texas violated the VRA\nwith racially gerrymandered districts. See LULAC v.\nPerry, 548 U.S. 399 (2006); Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S.\n952 (1996); Upham v. Seamon, 456 U.S. 37 (1982);\nWhite v. Weiser, 412 U.S. 783 (1973); White v.\nRegester, 412 U.S. 755 (1973).14\n\nThird, the State argues that any “claims against\nTexas’s 2011 redistricting plans became moot when\nthe 2013 Legislature repealed the 2011 plan.” Texas\nBr. 42 (internal quotation marks omitted). But this,\n\n14 Texas had the second highest number of VRA Section 5 objec-\ntions of any covered state. See Department of Justice, Voting\nDetermination Letters for Texas, perma.cc/3CK4-KDKB. In at\nleast 54 instances, Texas withdrew a proposed voting change\nafter it became clear that it would not be pre-cleared. See Nina\nPerales, Luis Figueroa & Criselda G. Rivas, Voting Rights in\nTexas: 1982-2006, 17 S. Cal. Rev. L. & Soc. Just. 713, 714\n(2008).\n\n\f27\n\nagain, is an exercise in misdirection. The claim here\nis not that the district court retained the power to\nenter judgment on the merits of the 2011 redistrict-\ning plans; it is that the discriminatory intent of the\n2011 plans remains relevant in assessing the validity\nof identical portions of the 2013 plans.\n\nFourth, even if it assumed that ending the litiga-\ntion was one of Texas’s motives,15 that is not the end\nof the matter. Appellees need not “prove that the\nchallenged action rested solely on [a] racially dis-\ncriminatory purpose[],” or even that it “was the ‘dom-\ninant’ or ‘primary’ one.” Village of Arlington Heights,\n429 U.S. at 265 (emphasis added). Instead, a redis-\ntricting plan violates the Equal Protection Clause if\nracial discrimination was a motivating factor. And\nhere, any hope that Texas entertained of ending this\nlitigation by adopting the district court’s interim\nplan was incidental to the Legislature’s larger (and\nclosely related) goal of insulating from further chal-\nlenge maps that discriminated against Latino voters.\n\nFifth, and perhaps most notably, the district\ncourt in fact found that Plan H358 was enacted with\na discriminatory purpose. Appellees recount the dis-\ntrict court’s findings in detail, showing that the Tex-\nas Legislature not only made no attempt to cure\nwhat the district court previously had found to be\n\n15 And that is a dubious assumption; the district court found\nthat the Texas Legislature “did not believe that passing the in-\nterim maps would end the litigation.” H.J.S. App. 358a n.45.\nRather, the Legislature knew that the “Plaintiffs would contin-\nue to pursue relief” as they had against the identical districts in\nPlan H283. Ibid. In fact, the court found that Texas Legislative\nCouncil Attorney Jeff Archer informed the legislators that “they\nhad not realistically removed legal challenges to the plans apart\nfrom those areas remedied by the interim plans.” Ibid.\n\n\f28\n\ndiscriminatory line-drawing, but “purposefully main-\ntained the intentional discrimination contained in\nPlan H283” (H.J.S. App. 6a); that “the 2013 Legisla-\nture intended to continue the intentional discrimina-\ntion found in Plan H283” (id. at 22a); that the Legis-\nlature in fact “intended any such taint to be main-\ntained but be safe from remedy” (id. at 359a); and\nthat the legislature acted with a strategy that was\n“discriminatory at its heart.” Ibid. As appellees also\nshow, this finding is reviewed under a highly defer-\nential standard. Appellees’ Br. 41-43. That finding is\namply supported by the record and bolstered by the\ngoverning legal principles. It should be affirmed.\n\n2. Texas had an affirmative duty to remove\n\nthe taint of racial discrimination.\n\nFinally, once a court determines that a state ac-\ntor has engaged in purposeful discrimination, the\n“racial discrimination [must] be eliminated root and\nbranch.” Green v. County Sch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430,\n437-438 (1968). The proper remedy for an unconsti-\ntutional exclusion aims to “eliminate so far as possi-\nble the discriminatory effects of the past and to bar\nlike discrimination in the future.” United States v.\nVirginia, 518 U.S. 515, 547 (1996) (emphasis added)\n(internal quotation marks and brackets omitted).\n\nOnce the district court found racial discrimina-\ntion in the 2011 maps, the Texas Legislature was ob-\nligated to remove the discriminatory taint before en-\nacting new maps. Texas contends that the imposition\nof this requirement “reverse[s] the burden of proof\nentirely.” Texas Br. 31. But that is not so. We agree\nthat the ultimate burden of proof remains on the\nplaintiffs. But to return to Justice Thomas’s observa-\ntion, in these circumstances “it is eminently reason-\nable to make the State bear the risk of nonpersua-\n\n\f29\n\nsion.” Fordice, 505 U.S. at 746-747 (Thomas, J., con-\n(citations omitted). Whether or not the\ncurring)\nstandard is formulated “in terms of a burden shift\nwith respect to intent,” the factors the Court “do[es]\nconsider—the historical background of the policy, the\ndegree of its adverse impact, and the plausibility of\nany justification asserted in its defense—are precise-\nly those factors that go into determining intent under\nWashington v. Davis, 426 U.S. 229 (1976).” Id. at\n747.\n\nHere, the Texas Legislature “does not discharge\nits constitutional obligations until it eradicates poli-\ncies and practices traceable to its prior” discrimina-\ntory legislation. Fordice, 505 U.S. at 728. But Texas\nhas not “completely abandoned its prior [discrimina-\ntory] system.” Id. at 729. Instead, “the State perpet-\nuate[d] policies and practices traceable to its prior\nsystem that continue to have [discriminatory] ef-\nfects,”\nthe Equal Protection\nClause.” Id. at 732. Cf. Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1,\nDenver, Colo., 413 U.S. 189, 208 (1973) (“[A] finding\nof intentionally segregative school board actions” in\none portion of the school system “creates a presump-\ntion” that other actions have the same intent.).\n\n“run[ning] afoul of\n\nThe common sense of the matter is not really de-\nbatable. In 2011, the Texas Legislature drew maps\nfor the purpose of discriminating. Two years later,\nwhen given an opportunity to remedy this wrong,\nmany of the same legislators, guided by the same leg-\nislative leadership, put in place identical maps that\nwill have the same discriminatory effect. In this con-\ntext, the contention that discriminatory intent has\nsomehow fallen out of the case is, to quote Texas,\n“every bit as implausible as it sounds.” Texas Br. 1.\n\n\f30\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nIf the Court does not dismiss the case for lack of\njurisdiction, as appellees urge, it should affirm the\njudgment of the district court.\n\nRespectfully submitted.\n\nEUGENE R.
