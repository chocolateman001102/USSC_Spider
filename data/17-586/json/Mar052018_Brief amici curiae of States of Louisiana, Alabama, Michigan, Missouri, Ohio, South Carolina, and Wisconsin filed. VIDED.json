        "1\n\nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST\n\nAmici curiae are the States of Louisiana, Alabama,\nMissouri, Ohio, South Carolina, and Wisconsin.  The\nStates  have  a  vital  interest  in  the  law  regarding\nredistricting, since redistricting is inherently a State\nfunction,  and  each  of  the  States  have  an  interest  in\nholding free and fair elections in an efficient manner. \nThe district court’s ruling, challenging the sovereignty\nof States to hold their own elections and destabilizing\nelections  throughout  the  State  of  Texas,  has\nwidespread implications for States entering the 2018\nelection cycle and the coming 2020 redistricting cycle,\npotentially injecting chaos into the democratic system\nin  all  States.  Additionally,  the  district  court’s  ruling\nundermines the ability of States to rely in good faith on\nthe plain language of a district court opinion.1\n\n1 Pursuant to Sup. Ct. R. 37.6, amicus curiae and its counsel state\nthat none of the parties to this case nor their counsel authored this\nbrief  in  whole  or  in  part,  nor  made  a  monetary  contribution\nspecifically  for  the  preparation  or  submission  of  this  brief.  The\nState of Louisiana paid for this brief. Amicus curiae files this brief\nwith the written consent of all parties, copies of which are on file\nin the Clerk’s Office. All parties received timely notice of amicus\ncuriae’s intention to file this brief.",
        "2\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nAppellants  have  asked  this  Court,  inter  alia,\nwhether a federal court can find discriminatory intent\nwhen adopting a district court’s own remedial plan. We\necho Texas’ request that this Court should reverse the\nlower  court’s  orders  that  invalidated  legally  valid\nreapportionment legislation on multiple grounds. First,\na  state  legislature  is  permitted  to  rely  on  economic\nefficiency and the desire to halt extensive litigation as\nan  appropriate  factor  when  enacting  legislation.\nSecond,  the  district  court’s  holding  effectively\neviscerates \nlong  standing  principles  of  state\nsovereignty. Third, the district court issued advisory\nopinions  on  the  20112  plans  because  any  litigation\nagainst the 2011 plans was moot after the 2013 plans\nwere passed.\n\nThe district court’s decisions below would invalidate\ndecades of precedent from this Court recognizing that\nStates—not unelected judges—have the primary duty\nof  deciding  the  political  question  of  legislative\nboundaries, so long as those boundaries comply with\nthe United States Constitution and the Voting Rights\nAct  (“VRA”).  States  have  many  responsibilities,  only\none  of  which  is  deciding  on  the  “Times,  Places,  and\nManner  of  holding  elections.”  See  U.S.  Const.  art  I,\n§ IV. A State’s rational choice to conserve its limited\ntemporal  resources  by  enacting  a\nfiscal  and \npresumptively valid map does not and cannot possibly\n\n2  The  district  court  subsequently  relied  on  the  2011  advisory\nopinions to shift the burden of proof to the State thereby failing to\napply the proper test under Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442\nU.S. 256 (1979).",
        "3\n\ncreate the discriminatory intent the district court below\nfound. The district court goes so far as to hold that the\nTexas  Legislature’s  level  of  inquiry  and  legislative\ndebate  as  to  the  merits  of  the  court  map  was\ninsufficient  when  measured  against  some  unnamed\nquantitative  or  qualitative  standard.  Rather  than\nrequiring a State to prove that the district court’s own\nmap contained no discriminatory intent adverse to the\nConstitution  and  the  VRA,  a  federal  court  should,\nunder  this  Court’s  precedents,  approach  a  validly\ndrawn  and  enacted  map  with  the  presumption  of\nconstitutionality. In ruling against the 2013 Plan, the\ndistrict court has flipped the longstanding presumption\nof  validity  on  its  head  by  assuming  that  the  court-\ndrawn  plan  contains  impermissible  discriminatory\nintent.  Additionally,  the  district  court  ignored  the\nprecedent  of  this  Court  and  of  the  Fifth  Circuit  by\nfailing  to  declare  all  legal  actions  against  the  2011\nplans as moot upon the Texas Legislature’s adoption of\nthe court’s plan as its own.",
        "4\n\nARGUMENT\n\nI. LEGISLATIVE  EFFICIENCY \n\nIS  A  VALID\n\nREAPPORTIONMENT CONSIDERATION.\n\nA. The  Texas  Legislature’s  2013  Plan  Was  a\nValid Exercise of State Power to End This\nDispute.\n\nAs described in Appellants’ brief, the district court\nstruck down the 2011 Texas Legislature’s redistricting\nplan,  holding  it  violated  the  VRA.  The  district  court\nthen concluded that a different elected body,3 the 2013\nTexas Legislature, possessed a racially discriminatory\npurpose  in  violation  of  §  2  and  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment  by  adopting  the  district  court’s  own\nredistricting plan. Specifically, the district court stated\nthat the 2013 Legislature “purposefully maintained the\nintentional  discrimination  contained  in  [the  2011\nPlan]” because certain districts where the court found\nviolations \n“remain  unchanged  or  substantially\nunchanged”  in  the  2013  Plan.  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017\nU.S. Dist. Lexis 136226, *18, 2017 WL 3668115 (W.D.\nTex. 2017). The district court reached this conclusion\nby  reasoning  that  it  found  certain  violations  in  the\n2011 Plan, but the 2013 Legislature failed to pursue\nsufficient changes to the 2013 Plan beyond what was\nidentified  by  the  district  court  and  ordered  to  be\nchanged.\n\n3 The Texas Legislature meets in regular session only in every odd-\nnumbered  year.  See  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  §  301.001.  By  express\nprovision of the Texas Constitution, the legislature meets for only\n140 days unless a special session is called. Tex. Const. art. 3, § 24.",
        "5\n\nThe weight of the legislative history in passing the\n2013 Plan suggests that the 2013 Legislature focused\non fixing the legal infirmities (if any) of the 2011 Plan\nand  acted  as  it  did  to  efficiently  resolve  the  map-\ndrawing process in good faith reliance on the district\ncourt’s map. Indeed, in the apparent interest of state\npolicy  and  efficiency,  the  Legislature  approved  the\ncourt-ordered plan and went on to its other business.\nThe  2013  Legislature  could  not  possibly  achieve  its\nstated  goal  of  avoiding  further  litigation  if  it  was\nadopting  a  plan  that  is  rife  with  legal  infirmities.\nSurely,  a  legislature  intentionally  furthering  a  pre-\nexisting discriminatory purpose would not be seeking\nto avoid further litigation. As the United States noted,\n“[a]n intent to end litigation, without more, is not an\nintent to discriminate.” United States Brief at 41.\n\nThe district court’s supposition that the Legislature\nadopted the 2013 Plan as part of a trial strategy and\nfor purposes of efficiency should instead stand against\nnot  for  the  proposition  that  the  legislature  was\nintentionally \nfurthering  an  existent  purposeful\ndiscrimination.  In  other  words,  “[w]e  doubt  that  the\nconstitutional  line  separating  the  legislative  and\njudicial powers turns on” the “court’s doubts about” a\nlegislature’s  “unexpressed  motives.”  Cf.  Patchak  v.\nZinke,  2018  U.S.  LEXIS  1515  at  *20  (Feb.  27,  2018)\n(plurality op.). The district court improperly imputed\nthe finding of unlawful intent from the 2011 Plan onto\nthe  2013  Plan,  thereby  invalidating  the  court-drawn\nplans it drew, approved, and ordered enacted. Plainly\nstated,  the  2013  Plans  are  new  plans  based  on  the\ndistrict  court’s  own  2012  Plans,  cleansed  of  any\ndiscriminatory  “taint”  by  the  district  court’s  earlier",

See,\ne.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 541 (1978) (noting\nthat courts lack “political authoritativeness” and must\nact “in a manner free from any taint of arbitrariness or\ndiscrimination” in drawing remedial districts) (quoting\nConnor v.

The fact that the 2013 Plans\nmay share some lines with the 2011 Plans is of no legal\nsignificance  because  the  district  court  adopted  those\nlines as its own and, in doing so, made clear that the\nplan complied with the VRA and the Constitution. In",
        "7\n\nfact, the district court was required to ensure that its\nplans  were  compliant  with  both  the  VRA  and  the\nConstitution as instructed by this Court. See Perry v.\nPerez, 565 U.S. 388, 393 (2012).\n\nB. Boundless  Litigation,  Despite  the  Clear\nValidity  of  Texas’  Adoption  of  the  Court-\nOrdered  Plans,  has  an  Inherently\nDestabilizing Effect on Elections at Great\nExpense to Taxpayers.\n\nfactors, \n\nFree  and  fair  elections  is  a  foundational  tenet  of\ndemocracy  and  this  objective  must  be  pursued  to  a\nsatisfactory conclusion. However, the prior decisions of\nthat  due  process  requires\nthis  Court  dictate \nconsideration  of  distinct \nincluding  the\nGovernment’s  interest  in  implementing  additional\nfiscal  and  administrative  burdens.  See  Mathews  v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 335 (1976). Texas has been required\nto expend tremendous taxpayer resources in pursuit of\nthis litigation, including for the half-decade since the\n2013 Legislature sought to remedy constitutional and\nVRA deficiencies by passing a court-ordered map. The\n2013 Legislature considered that map to be free of any\nleftover “taint” of discrimination, given its imprimatur\nof acceptability issued expressly by the district court.\n\nThis Court should now recognize that the time for\nredundant  and  destabilizing  litigation  over  this  map\nhas ended, and the voters of Texas should be able to\nrely on the determination of their representatives and\nthe courts. For seven years now, the citizens of every\nTexas legislative and congressional district have had\nlittle certainty as to who would continue to represent\nthem,  or  whether  a  different  representative  would\nrepresent their interests. The effect of that uncertainty",
        "8\n\nthe  requirements  of \n\nis destabilizes the election process in the State, with\nthe potential for similar situations across the country.\nDespite the presence of clear guidance from this Court\nregarding \nthe  VRA—and\nimportantly, that the law does not require a state to\nengage  in  seemingly  boundless  litigation  over  moot\nplans—a  single  lower  court  has  thrown  into  further\nchaos the long-pending Texas legislative redistricting\nprocess.  See,  e.g.,  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455\n(2017)  (describing  the  review  process  for  a  district\nunder the VRA).  \n\nIf the district court is allowed to impute the intent\nof the 2011 Legislature when enacting the 2011 Plans\nonto a different Legislature altogether when enacting\nthe  court-ordered  2013  Plans, \nthe  potential\nramifications  will  flow  well  beyond  this  case.  Taken\nliterally,  the  district  court’s  holding  means  that  any\nprior legislation found impermissible by a court could\nnever  be  cured  by  a  subsequent  legislature.  Such  a\nresult is nonsensical. Indeed, in this case, the district\ncourt  relies  on  the  fact  that  the  2013  Legislature\nenacted the court-ordered plans, which were redrawn\nto avoid a discriminatory purpose, to hold that the 2013\nLegislature acted with discriminatory purpose. If this\ncircular logic stands, it will work extreme unfairness to\nState litigants by calling into question the finality of\njudgments.  States  will  be  unable  to  be  sure  if  court\norders  are  valid  or  reliable  and  therefore  may  only\nadopt them at the risk of years of ongoing litigation.\nMoreover,  such  reasoning  could  require  similarly\nsituated legislatures to scrap existing maps and redraw\nall of their electoral districts. A comprehensive redraw\nwould  occur  at  enormous  cost  to  taxpayers,  would\nfurther destabilize the bond between a representative",

THE  DISTRICT  COURT’S  HOLDINGS  EVISCERATE\n\nPRINCIPLES OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY.\n\nA. The  District  Court  Was  Wrong  to  Impose\nthe  Texas  Legislature  Any\nits  Constitutional\n\nUpon \nModifications \nDeliberative Process.\n\nto \n\nThe District Court erred by imposing a new extra-\nconstitutional  requirement  on  the  Texas  Legislature\nwhen  it  required  a  sufficiently  robust  deliberative\nprocess.  See  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS\n129982, *49-50 (Aug. 15, 2017) (“[T]he Legislature did\nnot engage in a deliberative process to ensure that the\n2013  plans  cured  any  taint  from  the  2011  plans.”).\nFirst,  no  such  deliberative  process  is  required  by\nfederal or Texas state law. Second, assuming arguendo\nthat such a process is required, the Texas Legislature\nfulfilled the requirement by enacting the district courts\nmap. \n\nAs  explained  more  fully  infra,  when  reviewing  a\nlawfully  enacted  statute  by  a  state  legislature,  the\ncourt  must  start  from  a  position  of  presumed\nconstitutionality, rather than suspicion. See Miller v.\n\n4 Nothing in this brief should be read to advance an argument that\nconstitutional deficiencies in a law should be ignored in favor of\ncost  considerations.  Rather,  a  State  should  be  able  to  presume\nreliance  on  a  decision  of  district  court  expressly  charged  with\ndrawing a map designed to cure constitutional and VRA issues.\nWithout such reliance, the likely outcome is endless litigation in\npursuit of endlessly moving goalposts.",
        "10\n\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). Here, the district\ncourt  failed  to  give  deference  to  the  legislature  or\nbinding precedent. In fact, the district court, at every\nturn,  seemed  to  presume  ill  intent  on  behalf  of  the\nTexas  Legislature,  which  is  especially  evident  by\nimproperly carrying over claims and evidence against\nthe 2011 Plans to the 2013 Plans. See Perez v. Abbott,\n2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35012, *19-20 (W.D. Tex. March\n10,  2017).  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS\n129982 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2017); Perez v. Abbott, 250\nF. Supp. 3d 123, 226 (W.D. Tex. April 20, 2017) (Smith,\nCJ dissenting). \n\nis  the  electorate  that  holds  the \n\nThe Court cannot impose a deliberative process on\na  legislature.  “The  Constitution  does  not  and  cannot\nguarantee  that  legislators  will  carefully  scrutinize\nlegislation and deliberate before acting. In a democracy\nlegislators\nit \naccountable  for  the  wisdom  of  their  choices.”  INS  v.\nChadha,  462  U.S.  919,  997  (1983)  (White,  J.,\ndissenting). Some State legislatures can, and do, place\nfloors on their own deliberative processes to ensure a\nbasic level of debate, for instance “three-reading” rules\nin  Massachusetts  and  Minnesota,  and \ntiming\nprovisions related to the introduction of new legislation\nfound in a majority of the states. \n\nFor the court to now ignore these principles of self-\nrule, pierce through inherent differences in the political\nmakeup  of  diverse  sovereign  states,  and  impose\njudicially-created debate standards would not only be\nrife  with  federalism  problems  but  would  also  be\nimpractical.    Such  an  approach  to  state  legislative\nprocedures would open the floodgates to a new cause of\nlegislative  districts,\naction  by  which  to  attack",
        "11\n\nunsupported  by  any  federal  law.  See  generally\nPennhurst  State  School  and  Hospital  v.  Halderman,\n451 U.S. 1, 16 (1981) (holding that where legislation\n“imposes congressional power on a State involuntarily,\nand  because  it  often  intrudes  on  traditional  state\nauthority, we should not quickly attribute to Congress\nan  unstated  intent  to  act  under  its  authority”  and\nrefusing to impose mandatory obligations on the States\nwhere Congress nowhere stated its intent to do so); see\nalso Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991) (where\ncongressional  intent  is  ambiguous,  Court  will  not\nattribute an intent to intrude on State governmental\nfunctions).  The  district  court,  now,  is  attempting  to\nsupplant the 2013 Texas Legislature’s discretion for its\nown as to what constitutes sufficient deliberation. This\nis wholly inappropriate.\n\nFundamentally, the role of the judiciary is to apply\nthe law, not to decide what law and in what manner it\nwould rather have applied it. “The courts, in assessing\nthe sufficiency of a challenge to a districting plan, must\nbe  sensitive  to  the  complex  interplay  of  forces  that\nenter  a  legislature’s  redistricting  calculus.”  Miller  v.\nJohnson,  515  U.S.  900,  915-16  (1995).  No  such\nsensitivity is shown here. Instead, presuming ill intent\nby  adopting  the  court’s  own  plan,  the  district  court\nplaced  the  plaintiffs’  policy  choices  ahead  of  those\nelected for that task.  \n\n[The  court’s]  role  is  not  to  determine  whether\nthe procedural choices made by the legislature\nwere the best among a range of options, whether\nthe legislative action had to reflect the testimony\nreceived at the public hearings, or whether the\nlegislature  was  required  to  consider  that",
        "12\n\ntestimony  or  input  during  its  redistricting\ndeliberations.  [The  court’s]  task,  instead,  is  to\ndetermine  whether  the  legislature’s  actions\nviolated federal law.”\n\nMartinez v. Bush, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1298 (S.D. Fla.\n2002). \n\nThe deference afforded State legislatures does not\njust apply to the laws they pass but also applies to the\nprocess the States adopt to pass laws. On matters of\npolicy and fact-finding generally, this Court has also\nlong  extended  significant  deference \nto  State\nlegislatures. “States are not required to convince the\ncourts of the correctness of their legislative judgments.\nRather,  ‘those  challenging  the  legislative  judgment\nmust  convince  the  court  that  the  legislative  facts  on\nwhich the classification is apparently based could not\nreasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental\ndecision maker.’” Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery\nCo.,  449  U.S.  456,  463-64  (1981)  (quoting  Vance  v.\nBradley, 440 U.S. 93, 111 (1979) and citing Day-Brite\nLighting, Inc. v. Missouri, 342 U.S. 421, 425 (1952) and\nHenderson  Co.  v.  Thompson,  300  U.S.  258,  264-65\n(1937)).  So  long  as  there  is  “evidence  before  the\nlegislature reasonably supporting the classification,” a\nduly  enacted  piece  of  legislation  should  not  be\ninvalidated  even  if  a  challenger  could  “tender[]\nevidence in court that the legislature was mistaken”\nId.;  see  also  Nathaniel  Persily,  When  Judges  Carve\nDemocracies: A Primer on Court-Drawn Redistricting\nPlans, Faculty Scholarship, Paper 74 (2005), available\nat http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship\n/74.  Based  on  the  record  below  the  Legislature  had\nample evidence that (1) the plans fully complied with",
        "13\n\nall requirements of the Constitution and the VRA; and\n(2) the legislature, relying on the court’s judgment to\nthat effect, enacted the new plans to dispose of future\nlitigation.\n\nA federal court simply cannot impose a one-size-fits-\nall deliberative requirement on state legislatures. State\nlegislatures  vary  widely  in  their  rules  regarding  the\ndeliberation of an action, as well as the amount of time\nthey are in session. Some are full-time, and some are\npart-time.  The  Texas  Legislature,  for  instance,  only\nholds  a  regular  session  every  other  year.  Some  have\naggressive  policy  agendas  based  on  the  political\nturbulence  of  a  given  moment,  and  some  have  far\ngreater stability due to a multi-term governor or single-\nparty control. Deliberation, by its very nature, cannot\neven be measured in simplistic objective terms such as\ndays or hours. Imposing some standard for deliberation\nwould be unfounded in federal law or the Constitution\nand  would  also  be  in  direct  violation  of  this  Court’s\nholdings in Northwest Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One\nv. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203 (2009) in which the Court\ndescribed  a \n“fundamental  principle  of  equal\nsovereignty” among the States. The Court, therefore,\ncannot impose a single set of deliberative requirements\non a multitude of sovereign states.\n\nB. Texas’ Lawful Legislative Enactments are\nDeserving  of  Judicial  Deference  and  a\nPresumption of Constitutionality. \n\nDrawing  districts  is  “primarily  the  duty  and\nresponsibility  of  the  State  through  its  legislature  or\nother body, rather than of a federal court.” Voinovich v.\nQuilter, 507 U.S. 146, 156 (1993); see also Shelby Co. v.\nHolder,  133  S.

See  Perez  v.\nAbbott, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35012, at 16 (W.D. Tex.\nMarch 10, 2017) (outlining the district court’s concern\nthat the legislature had not conceded illegality of the\n2011  Plan  and  there  was  “no  indication  that  the\nLegislature would not engage in the same conduct” in\nthe  future).

The federal courts have\nan affirmative duty to always assess the “the intrusive\npotential  of  judicial  intervention  into  the  legislative\nrealm.” See id. at 916-17. The district court absolutely\nfailed to do that here.\n\nNeedless  to  say,  the  potential  implications  of  the\ndistrict court’s actions are enormous. Time and again\nthis  Court  has  held  that  where  legitimate  motives\nexist, government action is presumed valid and a court\nmay not automatically infer an unlawful purpose. See,\ne.g., U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 721\n(1990)  (beginning  the  inquiry  by  “noting  the  heavy\npresumption of constitutionality to which a carefully\nconsidered  decision  of  a  coequal  and  representative\nbranch of our Government is entitled.”); McCleskey v.\nKemp,  481  U.S.  279,  298-99  (1987)  (refraining  from\ninferring discriminatory purpose where the state had\nlegitimate  reasons  to  adopt  and  maintain  capital\npunishment); United States v.

If  the  district  court’s  ruling  is\npermitted  to  stand,  there  is  nothing  left  to  bar  the\nfederal judiciary’s “serious intrusion on the most vital\nof local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915 (1995), and\nlikewise,  nothing  left  of  the  mandate  that  federal\ncourts  must  “exercise  extraordinary  caution”  in\nredistricting cases and afford states a presumption of\nconstitutionality and good faith. Id. at 916.\n\nWhat is truly extraordinary is that the district court\nwholly  failed  to  acknowledge  its  own  reasoning  and\nanalysis in support of the validity of the court-drawn\nplans as a good faith basis for Texas’ 2013 enactment.\nIn so doing, the Court repudiates its own findings and\nthe  lawfulness  of  its  own  order.  Even  without\nadditional justification, the simple fact is that when the\ndistrict court entered an order directing Texas to adopt\nPlan C235 and H358,5 this order alone constituted a\nlegitimate,  good  faith  basis  for  the  enactment  of  the\nlegislation. The record lacks any basis on which to infer\nthat the 2013 Legislature had an improper purpose in\nadopting the Plans. Under a proper application of this\nCourt’s  precedent  and  the  presumption  of  good  faith\nand constitutionality, the District Court’s ruling must\nbe overturned.\n\n5  It  is  important  to  note  that  while,  Plan  C235  was  adopted\nwholesale  by  the  Texas  Legislature,  Plan  H358  was  slightly\nmodified for a few districts. However, this does not change the fact\nthat the district court completely dismissed its own reasons for\nadopting the interim plans as well as the Texas Legislature’s good\nfaith reliance on those reasons.",
        "17\n\nThe district court erred in two separate and distinct\nways as it failed to apply the Arlington Heights factors.\nSee Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1479-80 (2017)\n(citing Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977) (standards offered “a varied\nand non-exhaustive list of ‘subjects’ of proper inquiry in\ndetermining  whether  racially  discriminatory  intent\nexisted’”  while  also  reaffirming  that  the  Court  has\n“often held” the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove\nrace, not politics, “is demanding.” (citations omitted)).\nDespite the legislature basing its action on the valid\nremedy  of  the  district  court,  the  district  court  still\nfaulted it with a finding of discriminatory intent. The\nhistorical  background  of  the  action,  the  specific\nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  action,  and  the\nlegislative  history  of  the  action  all  can  be  directly\ntraced to the action of the district court itself. Cf. Vill.\nof  Arlington  Heights  v.  Metro.  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  429\nU.S.  252,  266-68.  A  legislature  adopting  a  federal\ndistrict court plan as its own is hardly a substantive\ndeparture from the norm. See id.\n\nThe  Arlington  Heights  framework  guides  how\nfederal  courts  should  go  about  finding  whether  a\ngovernmental  entity  acted  with  discriminatory\npurpose.  Nowhere  within  that  framework  do  federal\ncourts  have  a  blank  check  to  arbitrarily  find\nconstitutional  violations  on  the  sole  basis  that  they\ndisagree  with  States’  chosen  policies  and  internal\ndemocratic  processes.  Arlington  Heights  states  that,\nwhile the impact of the official action may provide “an\nimportant  starting  point,”  impact  alone  “is  not\ndeterminative  and  the  court  must  look  to  other\nevidence.”  Id.  at  266.  Particularly,  “the  specific\nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  challenged",
        "18\n\ndecision  also  may  shed  light  on  the  decisionmaker’s\npurposes.” Id. at 267 (citations omitted). The district\ncourt  here  struck  four  different  State  legislative\nactions,  including  the  extraordinary  measure  of  the\nLegislature’s  acquiescence  to  Plan  C235  precisely  as\ndrawn  by  the  district  court.  For  the  district  court,\napparently  nothing  the  Texas  legislature  could  do\nwould remedy the alleged violations. If a district court\ncan hold a State legislature acted unconstitutionally in\nadopting a court-ordered plan, absolutely nothing stops\nother  federal  courts  from  inserting  themselves  into\nstate deliberative processes and holding States hostage\nto this type of litigation in perpetuity. The precedent\nestablished by the district court, that the judiciary can\nhold a State in such a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-\ndon’t situation, is a wholly inappropriate overreach by\nthe  judiciary  into  the  realm  of  State  sovereign\ninterests. This Court has held that “reapportionment is\nprimarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  the  State,”\nChapman  v.  Meier,  420  U.S.  1,  27  (1975),  and\nlegislation\n“[f]ederal-court  review  of  districting \nrepresents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local\nfunctions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915. The presumption of\ngood faith carries particular weight in the context of\nredistricting legislation, and yet Texas was plainly not\nafforded such a presumption. This Court must refuse to\nallow the district court its exercise of such unlimited\ndiscretion, particularly in this case affecting the most\nvital of state functions, and which profoundly implicate\nstate sovereign interests and their individual citizens’\ninterests in representative democracy.",

Specifically, “[m]ootness has been\ndescribed  as  ‘the  doctrine  of  standing  set  in  a  time\nframe: The requisite personal interest that must exist\nat  the  commencement  of  litigation  (standing)  must\ncontinue through its existence (mootness).’” Id. at n.22\n(citing  and  quoting  United  States  Parole  Comm’n  v.\nGeraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980)). Mootness goes to\nthe  heart  of  this  Court’s  subject-matter  jurisdiction. \nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968) (“no justiciable\ncontroversy is presented…when the question sought to\nbe  adjudicated  has  been  mooted  by  subsequent\ndevelopments”)  (footnote  omitted).  Subject-matter\njurisdiction “cannot be forfeited or waived and should",
        "20\n\nbe considered when fairly in doubt.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662, 671 (2009).  This Court has “an obligation\nto  determine  whether  subject-matter  jurisdiction\nexists,  even  in  the  absence  of  a  challenge  from  any\nparty.” See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514\n(2006).  “If  the  court  determines  at  any  time  that  it\nlacks  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  the  court  must\ndismiss the action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\n\nPlainly, the district court should have respected the\nTexas Legislatures prerogative to enact new electoral\ndistricts by accepting the 2013 Plans as the governing\nlaw and therefore moving on to consider only the claims\nagainst those plans. Two specific instances where the\ndistrict  court  erred  must  be  addressed.  First,  the\ndistrict  court  erred  by  applying  the  “voluntary\ncessation”  exception  to  the  mootness  doctrine  to  the\nadoption of the 2013 Plans. Second, the district court\nfailed to heed the ruling of the Fifth Circuit in Davis\nthat resulted in another Texas 2011 redistricting plan\ncase becoming moot due to the exact same facts.\n\nD. The Voluntary Cessation Doctrine is a Very\nLimited Exception that was Misapplied by\nthe  District  Court  to  the  Adoption  of  the\n2013 Plans.\n\nIn general, “[s]uits regarding the constitutionality\nof statutes become moot once the statute is repealed.”\nMcCorvey v. Hill, 385 F.3d 846, 849 (5th Cir. 2004); see\nalso Diffenderfer v. Cent. Baptist Church, 404 U.S. 412,\n414-15  (1972).  Put  another  way,  in  the  context  of\nmootness, the courts are to review a “statute as it now\nstands, not as it once did.” Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45,\n48 (1969); see also e.g. Thorpe v. Housing Authority, 393\nU.S.  268,  281-282  (1969).  There  are  several  limited",
        "21\n\nexceptions to the mootness doctrine, one of which is the\nvoluntary cessation exception. It was this exception the\ndistrict  court  relied  upon  when  denying  the  original\nmotion  to  dismiss  this  action  as  moot.  See  Perez  v.\nPerry, 26 F. Supp. 3d 612 (2014). \n\nThe voluntary cessation exception to the mootness\ndoctrine  arises  when  “there  is  evidence  .  .  .  that  the\nstate  will  reenact  the  statute  or  one  that \nis\nsubstantially  similar.”  Id.;  see  also  United  States  v.\nW.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632-33 (1953). The mere\nability of the State legislature to reenact a statute after\nthe  lawsuit  is  dismissed  is  not  enough  to  satisfy  the\nexception.  See  Chem.  Producers  &  Distribs.  Ass’n  v.\nHelliker, 463 F.3d 871, 878 (9th Cir. 2006). Typically,\nthe  exception  applies  only  in  “situations  where  it  is\nvirtually  certain  that  the  repealed  law  will  be\nreenacted.” Id. Essentially, the exception is a rule out\nof  necessity,  to  avoid  that  rare  instance  where  the\nlegislature is intent on avoiding judicial review with\nthe clear intent to reinstate the challenged law.\n\nThis was the precise issue the Court was faced with\nin Aladdin’s Castle. In that case, this Court found that\nthe “voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does\nnot deprive a federal court of its power to determine\nthe  legality  of  the  practice”  when  the  jurisdiction  is\n“not  precluded  from  reenacting  precisely  that  same\nprovision.”  City  of  Mesquite  v.  Aladdin’s  Castle,  455\nU.S.  283,  289  (1982).  It  is  not  simply  the  possibility\nthat the challenged statute may be reenacted; rather\nthe relevant inquiry is an evaluation of “the likelihood\nthat  the  challenged  action  will  recur.”  Id.  at  296\n(White, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part);\nsee also Id. at 289. In Aladdin’s Castle, the jurisdiction",
        "22\n\nin question intended to reenact the repealed language\nupon  vacatur  of  the  district  court’s  judgment.  Id.  at\n289,  n.11.  In  this  context,  the  voluntary  cessation\nexception  is  simply  a  species  of  the  capability-of\nrepetition-but-evading-review exception.\n\nGiven  the  general  contours  of  the  exception,  it\n\nplainly applied to the adoption of the 2013 Plans. \n\nThe 2011 Plans were adopted over six years ago and\nwere enjoined shortly thereafter. Perez v. Abbott, 2017\nU.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  35012,  at  249.  The  district  court,\nhaving  found  constitutional  violations,  drew  interim\nplans. Id. Meanwhile, parallel litigation was pending\nover  Section  5  preclearance  under  the  VRA  for  the\noriginal  2011  Plans.  After  this  Court’s  holding  in\nShelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), Texas\nrepealed  the  2011  Plans  and  adopted  the  district\ncourt’s remedial plans. See Perez v. Abbott, 2017 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 35012, at 250 (W.D. Tex. March 10, 2017)\n(Smith,  J.  dissenting).  The  new  Plans  were\nsubsequently  signed  into  law  by  then-Governor  Rick\nPerry. Id. Texas has operated under the 2013 Plans for\nthe  last  three  election  cycles.  There  is  no  evidence\nTexas was engaged in some sort of legislative attempt\nto subvert the litigation or the district court in some\neffort to re-adopt the 2011 Plans. Instead, the majority\nof the district court refused to moot this case because,\ninter  alia,  “[1]  there  is  no  indication  that  the\nLegislature would not engage in the same conduct that\nPlaintiffs  assert  violated  their  rights  in  upcoming\nredistricting cycles; [and 2] because Texas refused to\nconcede the illegality of any conduct, a dispute remains\nover the legality of the challenged practices and there\nis no assurance that the conduct will not recur . . . .” Id.",
        "23\n\nat  16.  This  impermissibly  shifts  the  burden  to  the\nlegislature to prove its actions were not illegal, which\nis of course contrary to the great weight of this Court’s\nprecedent. \n\nFurthermore, the district court had clear evidence\nof  mootness  for  any  action  against  the  2011  Plans.\nDuring the pendency of this action, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit effectively held\nthat the “claims involving the 2011 Texas Senate plan\nwere moot” and in so doing overwhelmingly indicated\nthat the remainder of lawsuits pending on the various\n2011 Plans were also moot. See Perez v. Abbott, 2017\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 35012, at 249-51 (W.D. Tex. March\n10, 2017) (Smith, CJ. dissenting); Davis v. Abbott, 781\nF.3d 207 (5th Cir. 2015). As noted by the Judge Smith’s\ndissent,  “[a]  precedential  decision  by  a  circuit  court\nbinds all district courts in the circuit. That command is\nabsolute.”  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS\n35012, at 249-51 (W.D. Tex. March 10, 2017) (Smith, J.\ndissenting). \n\nFinally,  a  newly  released  decision  of  this  Court\nfurther  buttresses  the  position  that  any  proceeding\naddressing the 2011 plans should be dismissed as moot.\nAs a plurality of this Court recently stated in Patchak:\n“Under  this  Court’s  precedents,  Congress  has  the\npower  to  ‘apply  newly  enacted,  outcome-altering\nlegislation  in  pending  civil  cases,’  even  when  the\nlegislation  governs  one  or  a  very  small  number  of\nspecific subjects.” Patchak, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 1515 (Feb.\n27, 2018) (citing and quoting Bank Markazi v. Peterson,\n136 S. Ct. 1310, 1325 (2016)) (internal alterations and\ncross citations omitted).",
        "24\n\nAs  a  preliminary  matter,  the  Constitution’s\nElections Clause provides that “[t]he Times, Places and\nManner” of congressional elections “shall be prescribed\nin  each  State  by  the  Legislature  thereof”  unless\n“Congress”  should  “make  or  alter  such  Regulations.”\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. The Elections Clause vests\nauthority  over  congressional  elections  in  the  State\nlegislature and Congress. There is no express grant of\nauthority given to the federal courts. While, Patchak\nspecifically addresses Congress’ power to moot pending\nlitigation,  similar  reasoning  applies  here,  especially\nwhen  a  State  legislature  is  acting  under  an  express\ngrant of authority from the United States Constitution.\nSee  U.S.  Const.  art.  I,  §  IV.  Patchak  further  implies \nthat the voluntary cessation exception does not apply\nto legislative enactments that moot litigation outside\nexceptional circumstances not found here.\n\nAny  and  all  actions  against  the  2011  Plans  were\nmooted by the actions of the Texas Legislature when it\nadopted  the  court-ordered  plans  as  its  own.  Any\nreliance  on \nimproper  purpose  or\ndiscriminatory intent carried over from those plans was\nimproper and should have been wholly disregarded by\nthe district court. \n\nfinding  of \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nStates cannot efficiently hold free and fair elections\nwhere a district court can issue an order, cause states\nand voters to act in reliance on that order, and then\nsimply  change  its  mind  on  the  eve  of  a  deadline  to\nredraw  district  maps  for  the  2018  elections.  Such\nactions  result \ntremendous  cost  and  have\ndestabilizing  consequences  for  the  States.  Moreover,\nthe  district  court’s  arbitrary  approach  to  the  Texas\n\nin",
        "25\n\nLegislature’s actions disregards the deference afforded\nStates  on  this \nfundamental  question  of  State\nsovereignty.  Accordingly,  amicus  curiae  respectfully\nurge  this  Court  to  reverse  the  district  court’s  orders\nthat would invalidate districts in the 2013 Plan.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJeff Landry\n  Attorney General\n\nElizabeth B.

The\nStates  have  a  vital  interest  in  the  law  regarding\nredistricting, since redistricting is inherently a State\nfunction,  and  each  of  the  States  have  an  interest  in\nholding free and fair elections in an efficient manner. \nThe district court’s ruling, challenging the sovereignty\nof States to hold their own elections and destabilizing\nelections  throughout  the  State  of  Texas,  has\nwidespread implications for States entering the 2018\nelection cycle and the coming 2020 redistricting cycle,\npotentially injecting chaos into the democratic system\nin  all  States.  Additionally,  the  district  court’s  ruling\nundermines the ability of States to rely in good faith on\nthe plain language of a district court opinion.1\n\n1 Pursuant to Sup. Ct. R. 37.6, amicus curiae and its counsel state\nthat none of the parties to this case nor their counsel authored this\nbrief  in  whole  or  in  part,  nor  made  a  monetary  contribution\nspecifically  for  the  preparation  or  submission  of  this  brief.  The\nState of Louisiana paid for this brief. Amicus curiae files this brief\nwith the written consent of all parties, copies of which are on file\nin the Clerk’s Office. All parties received timely notice of amicus\ncuriae’s intention to file this brief.\n\n\f2\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nAppellants  have  asked  this  Court,  inter  alia,\nwhether a federal court can find discriminatory intent\nwhen adopting a district court’s own remedial plan. We\necho Texas’ request that this Court should reverse the\nlower  court’s  orders  that  invalidated  legally  valid\nreapportionment legislation on multiple grounds. First,\na  state  legislature  is  permitted  to  rely  on  economic\nefficiency and the desire to halt extensive litigation as\nan  appropriate  factor  when  enacting  legislation.\nSecond,  the  district  court’s  holding  effectively\neviscerates \nlong  standing  principles  of  state\nsovereignty. Third, the district court issued advisory\nopinions  on  the  20112  plans  because  any  litigation\nagainst the 2011 plans was moot after the 2013 plans\nwere passed.\n\nThe district court’s decisions below would invalidate\ndecades of precedent from this Court recognizing that\nStates—not unelected judges—have the primary duty\nof  deciding  the  political  question  of  legislative\nboundaries, so long as those boundaries comply with\nthe United States Constitution and the Voting Rights\nAct  (“VRA”).  States  have  many  responsibilities,  only\none  of  which  is  deciding  on  the  “Times,  Places,  and\nManner  of  holding  elections.”  See  U.S.  Const.  art  I,\n§ IV. A State’s rational choice to conserve its limited\ntemporal  resources  by  enacting  a\nfiscal  and \npresumptively valid map does not and cannot possibly\n\n2  The  district  court  subsequently  relied  on  the  2011  advisory\nopinions to shift the burden of proof to the State thereby failing to\napply the proper test under Pers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442\nU.S. 256 (1979). \n\n\f3\n\ncreate the discriminatory intent the district court below\nfound. The district court goes so far as to hold that the\nTexas  Legislature’s  level  of  inquiry  and  legislative\ndebate  as  to  the  merits  of  the  court  map  was\ninsufficient  when  measured  against  some  unnamed\nquantitative  or  qualitative  standard.  Rather  than\nrequiring a State to prove that the district court’s own\nmap contained no discriminatory intent adverse to the\nConstitution  and  the  VRA,  a  federal  court  should,\nunder  this  Court’s  precedents,  approach  a  validly\ndrawn  and  enacted  map  with  the  presumption  of\nconstitutionality. In ruling against the 2013 Plan, the\ndistrict court has flipped the longstanding presumption\nof  validity  on  its  head  by  assuming  that  the  court-\ndrawn  plan  contains  impermissible  discriminatory\nintent.  Additionally,  the  district  court  ignored  the\nprecedent  of  this  Court  and  of  the  Fifth  Circuit  by\nfailing  to  declare  all  legal  actions  against  the  2011\nplans as moot upon the Texas Legislature’s adoption of\nthe court’s plan as its own.    \n\n\f4\n\nARGUMENT\n\nI. LEGISLATIVE  EFFICIENCY \n\nIS  A  VALID\n\nREAPPORTIONMENT CONSIDERATION.\n\nA. The  Texas  Legislature’s  2013  Plan  Was  a\nValid Exercise of State Power to End This\nDispute.\n\nAs described in Appellants’ brief, the district court\nstruck down the 2011 Texas Legislature’s redistricting\nplan,  holding  it  violated  the  VRA.  The  district  court\nthen concluded that a different elected body,3 the 2013\nTexas Legislature, possessed a racially discriminatory\npurpose  in  violation  of  §  2  and  the  Fourteenth\nAmendment  by  adopting  the  district  court’s  own\nredistricting plan. Specifically, the district court stated\nthat the 2013 Legislature “purposefully maintained the\nintentional  discrimination  contained  in  [the  2011\nPlan]” because certain districts where the court found\nviolations \n“remain  unchanged  or  substantially\nunchanged”  in  the  2013  Plan.  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017\nU.S. Dist. Lexis 136226, *18, 2017 WL 3668115 (W.D.\nTex. 2017). The district court reached this conclusion\nby  reasoning  that  it  found  certain  violations  in  the\n2011 Plan, but the 2013 Legislature failed to pursue\nsufficient changes to the 2013 Plan beyond what was\nidentified  by  the  district  court  and  ordered  to  be\nchanged.\n\n3 The Texas Legislature meets in regular session only in every odd-\nnumbered  year.  See  Tex.  Gov’t  Code  §  301.001.  By  express\nprovision of the Texas Constitution, the legislature meets for only\n140 days unless a special session is called. Tex. Const. art. 3, § 24.\n\n\f5\n\nThe weight of the legislative history in passing the\n2013 Plan suggests that the 2013 Legislature focused\non fixing the legal infirmities (if any) of the 2011 Plan\nand  acted  as  it  did  to  efficiently  resolve  the  map-\ndrawing process in good faith reliance on the district\ncourt’s map. Indeed, in the apparent interest of state\npolicy  and  efficiency,  the  Legislature  approved  the\ncourt-ordered plan and went on to its other business.\nThe  2013  Legislature  could  not  possibly  achieve  its\nstated  goal  of  avoiding  further  litigation  if  it  was\nadopting  a  plan  that  is  rife  with  legal  infirmities.\nSurely,  a  legislature  intentionally  furthering  a  pre-\nexisting discriminatory purpose would not be seeking\nto avoid further litigation. As the United States noted,\n“[a]n intent to end litigation, without more, is not an\nintent to discriminate.” United States Brief at 41.\n\nThe district court’s supposition that the Legislature\nadopted the 2013 Plan as part of a trial strategy and\nfor purposes of efficiency should instead stand against\nnot  for  the  proposition  that  the  legislature  was\nintentionally \nfurthering  an  existent  purposeful\ndiscrimination.  In  other  words,  “[w]e  doubt  that  the\nconstitutional  line  separating  the  legislative  and\njudicial powers turns on” the “court’s doubts about” a\nlegislature’s  “unexpressed  motives.”  Cf.  Patchak  v.\nZinke,  2018  U.S.  LEXIS  1515  at  *20  (Feb.  27,  2018)\n(plurality op.). The district court improperly imputed\nthe finding of unlawful intent from the 2011 Plan onto\nthe  2013  Plan,  thereby  invalidating  the  court-drawn\nplans it drew, approved, and ordered enacted. Plainly\nstated,  the  2013  Plans  are  new  plans  based  on  the\ndistrict  court’s  own  2012  Plans,  cleansed  of  any\ndiscriminatory  “taint”  by  the  district  court’s  earlier\n\n\f6\n\nfinding  that  the  2012  Plans  were \nconstitutional violations and violations of the VRA.\n\nfree \n\nfrom\n\nIndeed,  a  court-ordered  plan    is  subject  to  a  far\nhigher standard than one drawn by a legislature. See,\ne.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 541 (1978) (noting\nthat courts lack “political authoritativeness” and must\nact “in a manner free from any taint of arbitrariness or\ndiscrimination” in drawing remedial districts) (quoting\nConnor v. Finch, 431 U.S. 408, 417 (1977)); Wyche v.\nMadison Par. Police Jury, 769 F.2d 265, 268 (5th Cir.\n1985)  (“Many  factors,  such  as  the  protection  of\nincumbents,  that  are  appropriate  in  the  legislative\ndevelopment of an apportionment plan have no place in\na plan formulated by the courts.”); Wyche v. Madison\nPar. Police Jury, 635 F.2d 1151, 1160 (5th Cir. 1981)\n(noting that “a court is forbidden to take into account\nthe  purely  political  considerations  that  might  be\nappropriate for legislative bodies”); Favors v. Cuomo,\nDocket  No.  11–cv–5632,  2012  WL  928216,  at  *18\n(E.D.N.Y. Mar. 12, 2012), report and recommendation\nadopted as modified, No. 11-cv-5632, 2012 WL 928223,\nat  *6  (E.D.N.Y.  Mar.  19,  2012);  Molina  v.  Cty.  of\nOrange,  No.  13CV3018,  2013  WL  3039589,  at  *8\n(S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2013), supplemented, No. 13CV3018,\n2013 WL 3039741 (S.D.N.Y. June 13, 2013), report and\nrecommendation adopted, No. 13 CIV. 3018 ER, 2013\nWL 3009716 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2013); Larios v. Cox,\n306 F. Supp. 2d 1214, 1218 (N.D. Ga. 2004); Balderas\nv.  Texas,  No.  6:01CV158,  2001  WL  36403750,  at  *4\n(E.D. Tex. Nov. 14, 2001). The fact that the 2013 Plans\nmay share some lines with the 2011 Plans is of no legal\nsignificance  because  the  district  court  adopted  those\nlines as its own and, in doing so, made clear that the\nplan complied with the VRA and the Constitution. In\n\n\f7\n\nfact, the district court was required to ensure that its\nplans  were  compliant  with  both  the  VRA  and  the\nConstitution as instructed by this Court. See Perry v.\nPerez, 565 U.S. 388, 393 (2012).\n\nB. Boundless  Litigation,  Despite  the  Clear\nValidity  of  Texas’  Adoption  of  the  Court-\nOrdered  Plans,  has  an  Inherently\nDestabilizing Effect on Elections at Great\nExpense to Taxpayers.\n\nfactors, \n\nFree  and  fair  elections  is  a  foundational  tenet  of\ndemocracy  and  this  objective  must  be  pursued  to  a\nsatisfactory conclusion. However, the prior decisions of\nthat  due  process  requires\nthis  Court  dictate \nconsideration  of  distinct \nincluding  the\nGovernment’s  interest  in  implementing  additional\nfiscal  and  administrative  burdens.  See  Mathews  v.\nEldridge, 424 U.S. 335 (1976). Texas has been required\nto expend tremendous taxpayer resources in pursuit of\nthis litigation, including for the half-decade since the\n2013 Legislature sought to remedy constitutional and\nVRA deficiencies by passing a court-ordered map. The\n2013 Legislature considered that map to be free of any\nleftover “taint” of discrimination, given its imprimatur\nof acceptability issued expressly by the district court.\n\nThis Court should now recognize that the time for\nredundant  and  destabilizing  litigation  over  this  map\nhas ended, and the voters of Texas should be able to\nrely on the determination of their representatives and\nthe courts. For seven years now, the citizens of every\nTexas legislative and congressional district have had\nlittle certainty as to who would continue to represent\nthem,  or  whether  a  different  representative  would\nrepresent their interests. The effect of that uncertainty\n\n\f8\n\nthe  requirements  of \n\nis destabilizes the election process in the State, with\nthe potential for similar situations across the country.\nDespite the presence of clear guidance from this Court\nregarding \nthe  VRA—and\nimportantly, that the law does not require a state to\nengage  in  seemingly  boundless  litigation  over  moot\nplans—a  single  lower  court  has  thrown  into  further\nchaos the long-pending Texas legislative redistricting\nprocess.  See,  e.g.,  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455\n(2017)  (describing  the  review  process  for  a  district\nunder the VRA).  \n\nIf the district court is allowed to impute the intent\nof the 2011 Legislature when enacting the 2011 Plans\nonto a different Legislature altogether when enacting\nthe  court-ordered  2013  Plans, \nthe  potential\nramifications  will  flow  well  beyond  this  case.  Taken\nliterally,  the  district  court’s  holding  means  that  any\nprior legislation found impermissible by a court could\nnever  be  cured  by  a  subsequent  legislature.  Such  a\nresult is nonsensical. Indeed, in this case, the district\ncourt  relies  on  the  fact  that  the  2013  Legislature\nenacted the court-ordered plans, which were redrawn\nto avoid a discriminatory purpose, to hold that the 2013\nLegislature acted with discriminatory purpose. If this\ncircular logic stands, it will work extreme unfairness to\nState litigants by calling into question the finality of\njudgments.  States  will  be  unable  to  be  sure  if  court\norders  are  valid  or  reliable  and  therefore  may  only\nadopt them at the risk of years of ongoing litigation.\nMoreover,  such  reasoning  could  require  similarly\nsituated legislatures to scrap existing maps and redraw\nall of their electoral districts. A comprehensive redraw\nwould  occur  at  enormous  cost  to  taxpayers,  would\nfurther destabilize the bond between a representative\n\n\f9\n\nand  her  constituent,  and  would  slow  the  legislative\nprocess to an unnecessary crawl.4\n\nII. THE  DISTRICT  COURT’S  HOLDINGS  EVISCERATE\n\nPRINCIPLES OF STATE SOVEREIGNTY.\n\nA. The  District  Court  Was  Wrong  to  Impose\nthe  Texas  Legislature  Any\nits  Constitutional\n\nUpon \nModifications \nDeliberative Process.\n\nto \n\nThe District Court erred by imposing a new extra-\nconstitutional  requirement  on  the  Texas  Legislature\nwhen  it  required  a  sufficiently  robust  deliberative\nprocess.  See  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS\n129982, *49-50 (Aug. 15, 2017) (“[T]he Legislature did\nnot engage in a deliberative process to ensure that the\n2013  plans  cured  any  taint  from  the  2011  plans.”).\nFirst,  no  such  deliberative  process  is  required  by\nfederal or Texas state law. Second, assuming arguendo\nthat such a process is required, the Texas Legislature\nfulfilled the requirement by enacting the district courts\nmap. \n\nAs  explained  more  fully  infra,  when  reviewing  a\nlawfully  enacted  statute  by  a  state  legislature,  the\ncourt  must  start  from  a  position  of  presumed\nconstitutionality, rather than suspicion. See Miller v.\n\n4 Nothing in this brief should be read to advance an argument that\nconstitutional deficiencies in a law should be ignored in favor of\ncost  considerations.  Rather,  a  State  should  be  able  to  presume\nreliance  on  a  decision  of  district  court  expressly  charged  with\ndrawing a map designed to cure constitutional and VRA issues.\nWithout such reliance, the likely outcome is endless litigation in\npursuit of endlessly moving goalposts.\n\n\f10\n\nJohnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). Here, the district\ncourt  failed  to  give  deference  to  the  legislature  or\nbinding precedent. In fact, the district court, at every\nturn,  seemed  to  presume  ill  intent  on  behalf  of  the\nTexas  Legislature,  which  is  especially  evident  by\nimproperly carrying over claims and evidence against\nthe 2011 Plans to the 2013 Plans. See Perez v. Abbott,\n2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35012, *19-20 (W.D. Tex. March\n10,  2017).  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS\n129982 (W.D. Tex. Aug. 15, 2017); Perez v. Abbott, 250\nF. Supp. 3d 123, 226 (W.D. Tex. April 20, 2017) (Smith,\nCJ dissenting). \n\nis  the  electorate  that  holds  the \n\nThe Court cannot impose a deliberative process on\na  legislature.  “The  Constitution  does  not  and  cannot\nguarantee  that  legislators  will  carefully  scrutinize\nlegislation and deliberate before acting. In a democracy\nlegislators\nit \naccountable  for  the  wisdom  of  their  choices.”  INS  v.\nChadha,  462  U.S.  919,  997  (1983)  (White,  J.,\ndissenting). Some State legislatures can, and do, place\nfloors on their own deliberative processes to ensure a\nbasic level of debate, for instance “three-reading” rules\nin  Massachusetts  and  Minnesota,  and \ntiming\nprovisions related to the introduction of new legislation\nfound in a majority of the states. \n\nFor the court to now ignore these principles of self-\nrule, pierce through inherent differences in the political\nmakeup  of  diverse  sovereign  states,  and  impose\njudicially-created debate standards would not only be\nrife  with  federalism  problems  but  would  also  be\nimpractical.    Such  an  approach  to  state  legislative\nprocedures would open the floodgates to a new cause of\nlegislative  districts,\naction  by  which  to  attack \n\n\f11\n\nunsupported  by  any  federal  law.  See  generally\nPennhurst  State  School  and  Hospital  v.  Halderman,\n451 U.S. 1, 16 (1981) (holding that where legislation\n“imposes congressional power on a State involuntarily,\nand  because  it  often  intrudes  on  traditional  state\nauthority, we should not quickly attribute to Congress\nan  unstated  intent  to  act  under  its  authority”  and\nrefusing to impose mandatory obligations on the States\nwhere Congress nowhere stated its intent to do so); see\nalso Gregory v. Ashcroft, 501 U.S. 452 (1991) (where\ncongressional  intent  is  ambiguous,  Court  will  not\nattribute an intent to intrude on State governmental\nfunctions).  The  district  court,  now,  is  attempting  to\nsupplant the 2013 Texas Legislature’s discretion for its\nown as to what constitutes sufficient deliberation. This\nis wholly inappropriate.\n\nFundamentally, the role of the judiciary is to apply\nthe law, not to decide what law and in what manner it\nwould rather have applied it. “The courts, in assessing\nthe sufficiency of a challenge to a districting plan, must\nbe  sensitive  to  the  complex  interplay  of  forces  that\nenter  a  legislature’s  redistricting  calculus.”  Miller  v.\nJohnson,  515  U.S.  900,  915-16  (1995).  No  such\nsensitivity is shown here. Instead, presuming ill intent\nby  adopting  the  court’s  own  plan,  the  district  court\nplaced  the  plaintiffs’  policy  choices  ahead  of  those\nelected for that task.  \n\n[The  court’s]  role  is  not  to  determine  whether\nthe procedural choices made by the legislature\nwere the best among a range of options, whether\nthe legislative action had to reflect the testimony\nreceived at the public hearings, or whether the\nlegislature  was  required  to  consider  that\n\n\f12\n\ntestimony  or  input  during  its  redistricting\ndeliberations.  [The  court’s]  task,  instead,  is  to\ndetermine  whether  the  legislature’s  actions\nviolated federal law.”\n\nMartinez v. Bush, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1298 (S.D. Fla.\n2002). \n\nThe deference afforded State legislatures does not\njust apply to the laws they pass but also applies to the\nprocess the States adopt to pass laws. On matters of\npolicy and fact-finding generally, this Court has also\nlong  extended  significant  deference \nto  State\nlegislatures. “States are not required to convince the\ncourts of the correctness of their legislative judgments.\nRather,  ‘those  challenging  the  legislative  judgment\nmust  convince  the  court  that  the  legislative  facts  on\nwhich the classification is apparently based could not\nreasonably be conceived to be true by the governmental\ndecision maker.’” Minnesota v. Clover Leaf Creamery\nCo.,  449  U.S.  456,  463-64  (1981)  (quoting  Vance  v.\nBradley, 440 U.S. 93, 111 (1979) and citing Day-Brite\nLighting, Inc. v. Missouri, 342 U.S. 421, 425 (1952) and\nHenderson  Co.  v.  Thompson,  300  U.S.  258,  264-65\n(1937)).  So  long  as  there  is  “evidence  before  the\nlegislature reasonably supporting the classification,” a\nduly  enacted  piece  of  legislation  should  not  be\ninvalidated  even  if  a  challenger  could  “tender[]\nevidence in court that the legislature was mistaken”\nId.;  see  also  Nathaniel  Persily,  When  Judges  Carve\nDemocracies: A Primer on Court-Drawn Redistricting\nPlans, Faculty Scholarship, Paper 74 (2005), available\nat http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship\n/74.  Based  on  the  record  below  the  Legislature  had\nample evidence that (1) the plans fully complied with\n\n\f13\n\nall requirements of the Constitution and the VRA; and\n(2) the legislature, relying on the court’s judgment to\nthat effect, enacted the new plans to dispose of future\nlitigation.\n\nA federal court simply cannot impose a one-size-fits-\nall deliberative requirement on state legislatures. State\nlegislatures  vary  widely  in  their  rules  regarding  the\ndeliberation of an action, as well as the amount of time\nthey are in session. Some are full-time, and some are\npart-time.  The  Texas  Legislature,  for  instance,  only\nholds  a  regular  session  every  other  year.  Some  have\naggressive  policy  agendas  based  on  the  political\nturbulence  of  a  given  moment,  and  some  have  far\ngreater stability due to a multi-term governor or single-\nparty control. Deliberation, by its very nature, cannot\neven be measured in simplistic objective terms such as\ndays or hours. Imposing some standard for deliberation\nwould be unfounded in federal law or the Constitution\nand  would  also  be  in  direct  violation  of  this  Court’s\nholdings in Northwest Austin Mun. Util. Dist. No. One\nv. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203 (2009) in which the Court\ndescribed  a \n“fundamental  principle  of  equal\nsovereignty” among the States. The Court, therefore,\ncannot impose a single set of deliberative requirements\non a multitude of sovereign states.\n\nB. Texas’ Lawful Legislative Enactments are\nDeserving  of  Judicial  Deference  and  a\nPresumption of Constitutionality. \n\nDrawing  districts  is  “primarily  the  duty  and\nresponsibility  of  the  State  through  its  legislature  or\nother body, rather than of a federal court.” Voinovich v.\nQuilter, 507 U.S. 146, 156 (1993); see also Shelby Co. v.\nHolder,  133  S.  Ct.  2612,  2623  (2013)  (quoting  Perry,\n\n\f14\n\nthe \n\n“States  do  not  derive \n\n565  U.S.  at  392).  Unless  reapportionment  choices\ncontravene federal requirements, the federal courts are\nbound  to  respect  the  States’  apportionment  choices\nbecause \ntheir\nreapportionment authority from the Voting Rights Act,\nbut  rather  from  independent  provisions  of  state  and\nfederal  law.”  Voinovich,  507  U.S.  at  156  (internal\ncitations  omitted);  see  also  U.S.  Const.  art  I,  §  IV\n(delegating the “Times, Places, and Manner of holding\nElections” to the State legislatures); Comm. for a Fair\n& Balanced Map v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections, 835 F.\nSupp. 2d 563, 593 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (refusing to replace\na State legislature’s enacted plan “with one that . . .\nadvance[s] the objectives of the minority political party\nat the time of redistricting.”).\n\nThe district court all but ignored this Court’s well-\nestablished  presumption  of  good  faith  accorded  to\nlegislative  enactments.    Miller  v.  Johnson,  515  U.S.\n900, 916 (1995). (“the presumption of good faith that\nmust be accorded legislative enactments,”) Here, the\ndistrict court failed to “exercise extraordinary caution\nin adjudicating claims that a State has drawn district\nlines on the basis of race,” and instead chose to declare\nthe 2013 Plans unlawful by applying a presumption of\ninvalidity  when  the  Texas  Legislature  acted  on  the\nbasis  of  the  district  court’s  own  ruling.  See  Perez  v.\nAbbott, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 35012, at 16 (W.D. Tex.\nMarch 10, 2017) (outlining the district court’s concern\nthat the legislature had not conceded illegality of the\n2011  Plan  and  there  was  “no  indication  that  the\nLegislature would not engage in the same conduct” in\nthe  future).    The  presumption  of  constitutionality  of\nlegislative  enactments  necessarily  means \nthat\nplaintiffs,  not  the  legislature,  bear  the  “demanding”\n\n\f15\n\nburden  of  showing  impermissible  motivation  behind\nthe legislative enactment at issue. Miller, 515 U.S. at\n928  (O’Connor,  J.  concurring).  Despite  the  district\ncourt’s analysis showing otherwise, any doubt or failure\nto carry that burden must be resolved in favor of the\nState. Id. at 916.\n\nleft  of  the \n\nleaves  nothing \n\nThe  district  court  eviscerated  the  presumption  of\ngood  faith  when  it  decided  that  the  State’s  action  in\nadopting the court’s own plans were unconstitutional.\nlong-standing\nThis \npresumption  of  validity  afforded  to  state  legislative\nenactments and usurps one of the most basic political\nfunctions of state legislatures. The federal courts have\nan affirmative duty to always assess the “the intrusive\npotential  of  judicial  intervention  into  the  legislative\nrealm.” See id. at 916-17. The district court absolutely\nfailed to do that here.\n\nNeedless  to  say,  the  potential  implications  of  the\ndistrict court’s actions are enormous. Time and again\nthis  Court  has  held  that  where  legitimate  motives\nexist, government action is presumed valid and a court\nmay not automatically infer an unlawful purpose. See,\ne.g., U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 721\n(1990)  (beginning  the  inquiry  by  “noting  the  heavy\npresumption of constitutionality to which a carefully\nconsidered  decision  of  a  coequal  and  representative\nbranch of our Government is entitled.”); McCleskey v.\nKemp,  481  U.S.  279,  298-99  (1987)  (refraining  from\ninferring discriminatory purpose where the state had\nlegitimate  reasons  to  adopt  and  maintain  capital\npunishment); United States v. Chem. Found., Inc., 272\nU.S.  1,  14-15  (1926)  (presumption  of  regularity  and\nproper discharge of official duties absent clear evidence\n\n\f16\n\nto  the  contrary);  Sunday  Lake  Iron  Co.  v.  Wakefield\nTwp., 247 U.S. 350, 353 (1918) (good faith and validity\nof  actions  presumed).  If  the  district  court’s  ruling  is\npermitted  to  stand,  there  is  nothing  left  to  bar  the\nfederal judiciary’s “serious intrusion on the most vital\nof local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915 (1995), and\nlikewise,  nothing  left  of  the  mandate  that  federal\ncourts  must  “exercise  extraordinary  caution”  in\nredistricting cases and afford states a presumption of\nconstitutionality and good faith. Id. at 916.\n\nWhat is truly extraordinary is that the district court\nwholly  failed  to  acknowledge  its  own  reasoning  and\nanalysis in support of the validity of the court-drawn\nplans as a good faith basis for Texas’ 2013 enactment.\nIn so doing, the Court repudiates its own findings and\nthe  lawfulness  of  its  own  order.  Even  without\nadditional justification, the simple fact is that when the\ndistrict court entered an order directing Texas to adopt\nPlan C235 and H358,5 this order alone constituted a\nlegitimate,  good  faith  basis  for  the  enactment  of  the\nlegislation. The record lacks any basis on which to infer\nthat the 2013 Legislature had an improper purpose in\nadopting the Plans. Under a proper application of this\nCourt’s  precedent  and  the  presumption  of  good  faith\nand constitutionality, the District Court’s ruling must\nbe overturned.\n\n5  It  is  important  to  note  that  while,  Plan  C235  was  adopted\nwholesale  by  the  Texas  Legislature,  Plan  H358  was  slightly\nmodified for a few districts. However, this does not change the fact\nthat the district court completely dismissed its own reasons for\nadopting the interim plans as well as the Texas Legislature’s good\nfaith reliance on those reasons. \n\n\f17\n\nThe district court erred in two separate and distinct\nways as it failed to apply the Arlington Heights factors.\nSee Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455, 1479-80 (2017)\n(citing Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977) (standards offered “a varied\nand non-exhaustive list of ‘subjects’ of proper inquiry in\ndetermining  whether  racially  discriminatory  intent\nexisted’”  while  also  reaffirming  that  the  Court  has\n“often held” the burden of proof on the plaintiff to prove\nrace, not politics, “is demanding.” (citations omitted)).\nDespite the legislature basing its action on the valid\nremedy  of  the  district  court,  the  district  court  still\nfaulted it with a finding of discriminatory intent. The\nhistorical  background  of  the  action,  the  specific\nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  action,  and  the\nlegislative  history  of  the  action  all  can  be  directly\ntraced to the action of the district court itself. Cf. Vill.\nof  Arlington  Heights  v.  Metro.  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  429\nU.S.  252,  266-68.  A  legislature  adopting  a  federal\ndistrict court plan as its own is hardly a substantive\ndeparture from the norm. See id.\n\nThe  Arlington  Heights  framework  guides  how\nfederal  courts  should  go  about  finding  whether  a\ngovernmental  entity  acted  with  discriminatory\npurpose.  Nowhere  within  that  framework  do  federal\ncourts  have  a  blank  check  to  arbitrarily  find\nconstitutional  violations  on  the  sole  basis  that  they\ndisagree  with  States’  chosen  policies  and  internal\ndemocratic  processes.  Arlington  Heights  states  that,\nwhile the impact of the official action may provide “an\nimportant  starting  point,”  impact  alone  “is  not\ndeterminative  and  the  court  must  look  to  other\nevidence.”  Id.  at  266.  Particularly,  “the  specific\nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  challenged\n\n\f18\n\ndecision  also  may  shed  light  on  the  decisionmaker’s\npurposes.” Id. at 267 (citations omitted). The district\ncourt  here  struck  four  different  State  legislative\nactions,  including  the  extraordinary  measure  of  the\nLegislature’s  acquiescence  to  Plan  C235  precisely  as\ndrawn  by  the  district  court.  For  the  district  court,\napparently  nothing  the  Texas  legislature  could  do\nwould remedy the alleged violations. If a district court\ncan hold a State legislature acted unconstitutionally in\nadopting a court-ordered plan, absolutely nothing stops\nother  federal  courts  from  inserting  themselves  into\nstate deliberative processes and holding States hostage\nto this type of litigation in perpetuity. The precedent\nestablished by the district court, that the judiciary can\nhold a State in such a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-\ndon’t situation, is a wholly inappropriate overreach by\nthe  judiciary  into  the  realm  of  State  sovereign\ninterests. This Court has held that “reapportionment is\nprimarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  the  State,”\nChapman  v.  Meier,  420  U.S.  1,  27  (1975),  and\nlegislation\n“[f]ederal-court  review  of  districting \nrepresents a serious intrusion on the most vital of local\nfunctions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915. The presumption of\ngood faith carries particular weight in the context of\nredistricting legislation, and yet Texas was plainly not\nafforded such a presumption. This Court must refuse to\nallow the district court its exercise of such unlimited\ndiscretion, particularly in this case affecting the most\nvital of state functions, and which profoundly implicate\nstate sovereign interests and their individual citizens’\ninterests in representative democracy.\n\n\f19\n\nC. The District Court Should Have Dismissed\nAll Claims Against the 2011 Plans for Lack\nof  Jurisdiction  After  Those  Plans  Were\nRepealed. \n\nA  key  concern  of  amici  is  the  extraordinary\nresources litigation of this type will impose upon the\nStates if allowed to stand. Any action against the 2011\nPlans  should  have  been  moot  under  long  standing\nprinciples of Fifth Circuit and this Court’s precedent.\nIn point of fact, the claims against those plans ought to\nhave been declared moot by the district court nearly\n5 years ago. By using as its basis plans that were no\nlonger  in  effect  and  ignoring  basic  principles  of  this\nCourt’s mootness doctrine, the parties have been forced\nto endure years of litigation. This is time and resources\nthat  could  have  obviously  been  spent  on  far  more\nproductive endeavors.  \n\nThe federal judiciary is confined to the decision of\n“Cases”  or  “Controversies.”  Arizonans  for  Official\nEnglish v. Arizona, 520 U.S. 43, 64 (1997); see also U.S.\nConst. art. III § 2. Specifically, “[m]ootness has been\ndescribed  as  ‘the  doctrine  of  standing  set  in  a  time\nframe: The requisite personal interest that must exist\nat  the  commencement  of  litigation  (standing)  must\ncontinue through its existence (mootness).’” Id. at n.22\n(citing  and  quoting  United  States  Parole  Comm’n  v.\nGeraghty, 445 U.S. 388, 397 (1980)). Mootness goes to\nthe  heart  of  this  Court’s  subject-matter  jurisdiction. \nFlast v. Cohen, 392 U.S. 83, 95 (1968) (“no justiciable\ncontroversy is presented…when the question sought to\nbe  adjudicated  has  been  mooted  by  subsequent\ndevelopments”)  (footnote  omitted).  Subject-matter\njurisdiction “cannot be forfeited or waived and should\n\n\f20\n\nbe considered when fairly in doubt.” Ashcroft v. Iqbal,\n556 U.S. 662, 671 (2009).  This Court has “an obligation\nto  determine  whether  subject-matter  jurisdiction\nexists,  even  in  the  absence  of  a  challenge  from  any\nparty.” See Arbaugh v. Y & H Corp., 546 U.S. 500, 514\n(2006).  “If  the  court  determines  at  any  time  that  it\nlacks  subject-matter  jurisdiction,  the  court  must\ndismiss the action.” Fed. R. Civ. P. 12(h)(3).\n\nPlainly, the district court should have respected the\nTexas Legislatures prerogative to enact new electoral\ndistricts by accepting the 2013 Plans as the governing\nlaw and therefore moving on to consider only the claims\nagainst those plans. Two specific instances where the\ndistrict  court  erred  must  be  addressed.  First,  the\ndistrict  court  erred  by  applying  the  “voluntary\ncessation”  exception  to  the  mootness  doctrine  to  the\nadoption of the 2013 Plans. Second, the district court\nfailed to heed the ruling of the Fifth Circuit in Davis\nthat resulted in another Texas 2011 redistricting plan\ncase becoming moot due to the exact same facts.\n\nD. The Voluntary Cessation Doctrine is a Very\nLimited Exception that was Misapplied by\nthe  District  Court  to  the  Adoption  of  the\n2013 Plans.\n\nIn general, “[s]uits regarding the constitutionality\nof statutes become moot once the statute is repealed.”\nMcCorvey v. Hill, 385 F.3d 846, 849 (5th Cir. 2004); see\nalso Diffenderfer v. Cent. Baptist Church, 404 U.S. 412,\n414-15  (1972).  Put  another  way,  in  the  context  of\nmootness, the courts are to review a “statute as it now\nstands, not as it once did.” Hall v. Beals, 396 U.S. 45,\n48 (1969); see also e.g. Thorpe v. Housing Authority, 393\nU.S.  268,  281-282  (1969).  There  are  several  limited\n\n\f21\n\nexceptions to the mootness doctrine, one of which is the\nvoluntary cessation exception. It was this exception the\ndistrict  court  relied  upon  when  denying  the  original\nmotion  to  dismiss  this  action  as  moot.  See  Perez  v.\nPerry, 26 F. Supp. 3d 612 (2014). \n\nThe voluntary cessation exception to the mootness\ndoctrine  arises  when  “there  is  evidence  .  .  .  that  the\nstate  will  reenact  the  statute  or  one  that \nis\nsubstantially  similar.”  Id.;  see  also  United  States  v.\nW.T. Grant Co., 345 U.S. 629, 632-33 (1953). The mere\nability of the State legislature to reenact a statute after\nthe  lawsuit  is  dismissed  is  not  enough  to  satisfy  the\nexception.  See  Chem.  Producers  &  Distribs.  Ass’n  v.\nHelliker, 463 F.3d 871, 878 (9th Cir. 2006). Typically,\nthe  exception  applies  only  in  “situations  where  it  is\nvirtually  certain  that  the  repealed  law  will  be\nreenacted.” Id. Essentially, the exception is a rule out\nof  necessity,  to  avoid  that  rare  instance  where  the\nlegislature is intent on avoiding judicial review with\nthe clear intent to reinstate the challenged law.\n\nThis was the precise issue the Court was faced with\nin Aladdin’s Castle. In that case, this Court found that\nthe “voluntary cessation of a challenged practice does\nnot deprive a federal court of its power to determine\nthe  legality  of  the  practice”  when  the  jurisdiction  is\n“not  precluded  from  reenacting  precisely  that  same\nprovision.”  City  of  Mesquite  v.  Aladdin’s  Castle,  455\nU.S.  283,  289  (1982).  It  is  not  simply  the  possibility\nthat the challenged statute may be reenacted; rather\nthe relevant inquiry is an evaluation of “the likelihood\nthat  the  challenged  action  will  recur.”  Id.  at  296\n(White, J. concurring in part and dissenting in part);\nsee also Id. at 289. In Aladdin’s Castle, the jurisdiction\n\n\f22\n\nin question intended to reenact the repealed language\nupon  vacatur  of  the  district  court’s  judgment.  Id.  at\n289,  n.11.  In  this  context,  the  voluntary  cessation\nexception  is  simply  a  species  of  the  capability-of\nrepetition-but-evading-review exception.\n\nGiven  the  general  contours  of  the  exception,  it\n\nplainly applied to the adoption of the 2013 Plans. \n\nThe 2011 Plans were adopted over six years ago and\nwere enjoined shortly thereafter. Perez v. Abbott, 2017\nU.S.  Dist.  LEXIS  35012,  at  249.  The  district  court,\nhaving  found  constitutional  violations,  drew  interim\nplans. Id. Meanwhile, parallel litigation was pending\nover  Section  5  preclearance  under  the  VRA  for  the\noriginal  2011  Plans.  After  this  Court’s  holding  in\nShelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013), Texas\nrepealed  the  2011  Plans  and  adopted  the  district\ncourt’s remedial plans. See Perez v. Abbott, 2017 U.S.\nDist. LEXIS 35012, at 250 (W.D. Tex. March 10, 2017)\n(Smith,  J.  dissenting).  The  new  Plans  were\nsubsequently  signed  into  law  by  then-Governor  Rick\nPerry. Id. Texas has operated under the 2013 Plans for\nthe  last  three  election  cycles.  There  is  no  evidence\nTexas was engaged in some sort of legislative attempt\nto subvert the litigation or the district court in some\neffort to re-adopt the 2011 Plans. Instead, the majority\nof the district court refused to moot this case because,\ninter  alia,  “[1]  there  is  no  indication  that  the\nLegislature would not engage in the same conduct that\nPlaintiffs  assert  violated  their  rights  in  upcoming\nredistricting cycles; [and 2] because Texas refused to\nconcede the illegality of any conduct, a dispute remains\nover the legality of the challenged practices and there\nis no assurance that the conduct will not recur . . . .” Id.\n\n\f23\n\nat  16.  This  impermissibly  shifts  the  burden  to  the\nlegislature to prove its actions were not illegal, which\nis of course contrary to the great weight of this Court’s\nprecedent. \n\nFurthermore, the district court had clear evidence\nof  mootness  for  any  action  against  the  2011  Plans.\nDuring the pendency of this action, the United States\nCourt of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit effectively held\nthat the “claims involving the 2011 Texas Senate plan\nwere moot” and in so doing overwhelmingly indicated\nthat the remainder of lawsuits pending on the various\n2011 Plans were also moot. See Perez v. Abbott, 2017\nU.S. Dist. LEXIS 35012, at 249-51 (W.D. Tex. March\n10, 2017) (Smith, CJ. dissenting); Davis v. Abbott, 781\nF.3d 207 (5th Cir. 2015). As noted by the Judge Smith’s\ndissent,  “[a]  precedential  decision  by  a  circuit  court\nbinds all district courts in the circuit. That command is\nabsolute.”  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  U.S.  Dist.  LEXIS\n35012, at 249-51 (W.D. Tex. March 10, 2017) (Smith, J.\ndissenting). \n\nFinally,  a  newly  released  decision  of  this  Court\nfurther  buttresses  the  position  that  any  proceeding\naddressing the 2011 plans should be dismissed as moot.\nAs a plurality of this Court recently stated in Patchak:\n“Under  this  Court’s  precedents,  Congress  has  the\npower  to  ‘apply  newly  enacted,  outcome-altering\nlegislation  in  pending  civil  cases,’  even  when  the\nlegislation  governs  one  or  a  very  small  number  of\nspecific subjects.” Patchak, 2018 U.S. LEXIS 1515 (Feb.\n27, 2018) (citing and quoting Bank Markazi v. Peterson,\n136 S. Ct. 1310, 1325 (2016)) (internal alterations and\ncross citations omitted). \n\n\f24\n\nAs  a  preliminary  matter,  the  Constitution’s\nElections Clause provides that “[t]he Times, Places and\nManner” of congressional elections “shall be prescribed\nin  each  State  by  the  Legislature  thereof”  unless\n“Congress”  should  “make  or  alter  such  Regulations.”\nU.S. Const. art. I, § 4, cl. 1. The Elections Clause vests\nauthority  over  congressional  elections  in  the  State\nlegislature and Congress. There is no express grant of\nauthority given to the federal courts. While, Patchak\nspecifically addresses Congress’ power to moot pending\nlitigation,  similar  reasoning  applies  here,  especially\nwhen  a  State  legislature  is  acting  under  an  express\ngrant of authority from the United States Constitution.\nSee  U.S.  Const.  art.  I,  §  IV.  Patchak  further  implies \nthat the voluntary cessation exception does not apply\nto legislative enactments that moot litigation outside\nexceptional circumstances not found here.\n\nAny  and  all  actions  against  the  2011  Plans  were\nmooted by the actions of the Texas Legislature when it\nadopted  the  court-ordered  plans  as  its  own.  Any\nreliance  on \nimproper  purpose  or\ndiscriminatory intent carried over from those plans was\nimproper and should have been wholly disregarded by\nthe district court. \n\nfinding  of \n\nCONCLUSION\n\nStates cannot efficiently hold free and fair elections\nwhere a district court can issue an order, cause states\nand voters to act in reliance on that order, and then\nsimply  change  its  mind  on  the  eve  of  a  deadline  to\nredraw  district  maps  for  the  2018  elections.  Such\nactions  result \ntremendous  cost  and  have\ndestabilizing  consequences  for  the  States.  Moreover,\nthe  district  court’s  arbitrary  approach  to  the  Texas\n\nin \n\n\f25\n\nLegislature’s actions disregards the deference afforded\nStates  on  this \nfundamental  question  of  State\nsovereignty.  Accordingly,  amicus  curiae  respectfully\nurge  this  Court  to  reverse  the  district  court’s  orders\nthat would invalidate districts in the 2013 Plan.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJeff Landry\n  Attorney General\n\nElizabeth B.
