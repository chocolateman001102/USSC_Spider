        "BRIEF FOR APPELLEES \n\nAppellees  (other  than  the  United  States)  in  the \nabove-captioned  case  respectfully  request  that  the \nCourt dismiss this appeal for lack of jurisdiction under \n28  U.S.C.  § 1253  or,  alternatively,  that  the  Court \naffirm the district court’s order. \n\nJURISDICTION \n\nAppellants invoke this Court’s jurisdiction under \n28 U.S.C. § 1253. Brief for Appellants (“Texas Br.”) 3. \nAs  explained  below,  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  at \nthis time. See infra pages. 29-34. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nAppellants (“Texas” or the “State”) and the United \nStates  profoundly  mischaracterize  what  this  case  is \nabout.  They  would  have  this  Court  regard  the  Texas \nHouse  of  Representatives  (“state  house”)  districts  at \nissue here as “court-drawn” or “court imposed,” Texas \nBr. i, 9, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 39, 41, 45, 64, or part of a \ncourt’s  “own”  plan,  Brief  for  the  United  States  as \nAppellee  in  Support  of  Appellants  (“U.S. Br.”)  24.  To \nthe contrary: As Texas itself insisted the last time this \ndispute  came  to  the  Court,  these  districts  reflect  the \nState’s “choices”—not any court’s, Br. for Appellants at \n18, Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388 (2012) (Nos. 11-713 et \nal.). \n\nSix  of  the  districts—HD32  and  HD34  in  Nueces \nCounty; HD54 and HD55 in Bell County; and HD104 \nand  HD105  in  Dallas  County—were  drawn  by  the \nTexas  Legislature  in  2011  without  any  judicial \ninvolvement  and  were  reenacted,  without  change,  by \nin  2013.  The  district  court’s \nthe  Legislature \npreliminary decision in 2012 to leave those districts in",
        "2 \n\nit  drew \n\nplace  when \ninterim  remedial  districts \nelsewhere  in  the  State  did  nothing  to  change  those \ndistricts’  fundamental  character.  A  seventh  district, \nHD103 \nin  Dallas  County,  was  drawn  by  the \nLegislature in 2011 without any judicial involvement, \nwas left unchanged by the district court in 2012, and \nwas  reenacted  in  2013  with  immaterial  changes \nproposed by a legislator, H.J.S. App. 23a. And even the \nState admits that the eighth district at issue, HD90 in \nTarrant County, is of Texas’s own devising. See Texas \nBr. 64, 68.1 \n\nThe  court  below  found  that  both  the  original \nenactment  and  the  reenactment  of  the  districts  at \nissue  here  was \ninfected  by  purposeful  racial \ndiscrimination.  But  the  court  has  not  yet  enjoined \nTexas from using the districts. Texas filed this appeal \nbefore  the  court  could  hold  a  remedial  hearing. \nNothing in 28 U.S.C. § 1253 gives this Court power to \nhear  this  premature  appeal.  But  if  this  Court  does \nreach  the  merits,  it  should  reject  Texas’s  attempt  to \ncement discriminatory districts into place. \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nBased on a “voluminous record,” J.A. 117a (Order \nDenying  Motion  for  Entry  of  Judgment  under  Rule \n54(b) (Jan. 5, 2017)), the court below issued a series of \nlengthy  opinions  and  orders  setting  forth  detailed \n\n1 “H.J.S. App.” refers to the Appendix to the Jurisdictional \nStatement in No. 17-626. “C.J.S. App.” refers to the appendix to \nthe Jurisdictional Statement in No. 17-586. “M.D.A. App.” refers \nto the Appendix to the Motion to Dismiss or Affirm of Appellees \nMexican American Legislative Caucus, et al., in No. 17-626. “Task \nForce  M.D.A.  App.”  refers  to  the  Appendix  to  the  Motion  to \nDismiss or Affirm as to House District 90 in No. 17-626.",
        "3 \n\nfindings  of  fact  concerning  what  happened  in  the \nrelevant  time  period—the  biennium  from  2011  to \n2013. \n\nRedistricting after the 2010 census \n\nThe 2010 census showed that Texas’s population \nhad  grown  by  over  four  million  since  2000. Perry v. \nPerez,  565  U.S.  388,  390  (2012)  (per  curiam).  That \ngrowth  was  not  evenly  distributed  around  the  State. \nSee M.D.A. App. 2a. Thus, to comply with one person, \none vote, Texas had to redraw the districts from which \nstate  representatives  are  elected. Perry,  565  U.S.  at \n390. \n\nThe district court described the context in which \nthe  Legislature  undertook  the  post-2010  round  of \nredistricting  as  one  “of  strong  racial  tension  and \nheated  debate  about  Latinos,  Spanish-speaking \npeople,  undocumented  immigration  and  sanctuary \ncities, and the contentious voter ID law.” C.J.S. App. \n302a.  In  all  four  counties  relevant  here,  members  of \nracial or ethnic minority groups accounted for most or \nall  of  the  population  growth.  In  Nueces  County,  the \ngrowth  “was  attributable  to  Hispanics,  as  both \nAfrican-American  and  Anglo  population  declined.” \nM.D.A.  App.  91a. In Bell  County,  “more  than  70%  of \nthe  growth”  was  attributable  to  an  increase  in  the \nminority  population. Id.  278a.  In  Dallas  County,  the \nminority population grew by 350,000, while the Anglo \npopulation “decreased by over 198,000.” Id. 222a. And \nin  Tarrant  County,  “almost  89%  of  the  growth  was \nnon-Anglo.” Id. 257a, 266a. \n\nNonetheless,  Republican  legislators  “were  very \nresistant  to  creating  any  new  minority  opportunity \ndistricts.” M.D.A. App. 4a-5a. They worried any such",
        "4 \n\ndistricts would likely elect Democrats. Id. As a result, \n“[d]espite  the  massive  minority  population  growth,” \nthe  Legislature  “not  only  failed  to  create  any  new \nminority opportunity districts, it reduced the number \nof  minority  opportunity  districts.”  H.J.S.  App.  191a. \nIts plan, enacted into law as 2011 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. \nch. 1271 (H.B. 150), is known as Plan H283. \n\n2011:  Designing  the  challenged  districts  in \nNueces, Bell and Dallas Counties \n\nThe  configuration  of  each  of  the  challenged \ndistricts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  has \nremained  unchanged  (with  the  exception  of  an \nimmaterial  change  to  one  district  in  Dallas  County) \nsince they were first drawn by the Legislature in Plan \nH283.  The  district  court  made  extensive  findings \nregarding the districts’ configurations, the legislative \nintent  behind \nthe \nconsequences  of  those  configurations  for  the  voting \npower of minority citizens. \n\nconfigurations,  and \n\nthose \n\n1. Nueces County. “In both 2000 and 2010, Nueces \nCounty  was  majority  Hispanic  [in  total]  population \nand  majority  HCVAP  [Hispanic  citizen  voting-age \npopulation].”  M.D.A.  App. 91a.  Under  the  plan  in \neffect  prior to 2011, the county (whose largest city is \nCorpus  Christi)  elected  representatives  from  three \ndistricts—two  located  completely  within  the  county \nand one shared with adjoining counties. Id. 89a-90a. It \nwas  “undisputed  that  Nueces  County  had  two \nbenchmark  Latino  opportunity  districts”  under  the \npre-2011  plan.  H.J.S.  App.  126a.  Although  those \ndistricts  had  previously  elected  Latino  voters’ \ncandidates  of  choice,  they  had  elected  candidates \nopposed  by  a  majority  of  Latino  voters  in  2010. See \nM.D.A. App. 90a-91a.",
        "5 \n\nBecause  Nueces  County’s  population  grew \nrelatively slowly between 2000 and 2010 compared to \nthe rest of Texas, it became possible during the 2011 \nredistricting  to  place  the  entire  population  of  the \ncounty  within  two  districts,  rather  than  giving  it  a \nshare of three. M.D.A. App. 89a, 91a. Early in 2010, a \nstaff member of the Texas Legislative Council wrote to \nthe  chief  of  staff  to  the  Speaker  of  the  state  house: \n“Corpus—Two seats only; three R’s. And worse[,] one \nof  the  seats  will  probably  have  to  be  more  Hispanic \nthan the other and probably elect a D.” Id. 92a. With \nrespect  to  the  two  benchmark  districts  that  were \nmajority-Latino,  the  Speaker  mentioned  to  potential \nLatino  candidates  that  “one  of  their  seats  was  not \ngoing to be there for the next session.” Id. 91a-92a. \n\nThe district court found that it would in fact have \nbeen  possible  to  draw  two  majority  HCVAP  districts \nentirely  within  Nueces  County. See H.J.S.  App.  44a \n(pointing to a plan with districts that were 55.2% and \n59.9%  HCVAP).  But  “[r]ather  than  exploring”  this \npossibility,  the  Legislature  instead  “drew  one  safe \ndistrict  for  Hispanics  and  one  safe  district”  for  an \nAnglo  incumbent,  id.  59a.  Along  the  way,  the \nmapdrawers  justified  their  refusal  to  draw  a  second \nLatino  opportunity  district  by  invoking  a  different \nmeasure  of  Hispanic  population  “because \n[that \nmeasure]  was  lower  [than  HCVAP]  (and  lower  than \n50%),” id.  at  134a  (emphasis  added),  thus  making  it \nseem as if the Latino community could not satisfy the",
        "6 \n\nfirst precondition for  creating an opportunity district \nunder Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50 (1986).2 \n\nAs  compared  to  the  number  of  residents  who \nwould  be  included  in  two  ideally  populated  districts, \nNueces  County  was  overpopulated  by  roughly  5000 \npeople. But rather than splitting the excess population \nbetween  the  county’s  districts,  the  Legislature,  with \n“[n]o  explanation”  for  its  decision,  underpopulated \nHD32—the safe Anglo seat—by 563 people, producing \na  district  where  46.3%  of  the  citizens  of  voting  age \nwere Latino. M.D.A. App. 101a. It then overpopulated \nHD34—the majority Latino district—by 5,512 people, \ncreating a district where Latinos constituted 65.9% of \nvoting-age citizens. Id.3 \n\nIn  assessing  why  Texas  had  assigned  so  many \nmore voters to the heavily Latino district, rather than \nallocating  the  overage  more  evenly  between  the  two \ndistricts as an alternative proposal had suggested, the \n“[t]he  only  potential \nthat \ncourt  below \n\nfound \n\n2 The mapdrawers “felt” they could “offset” the retrogression \ncaused  by  eliminating  HD33,  a  benchmark  Latino  opportunity \ndistrict  in  Nueces  County,  “by  creating  a  new  Hispanic \nopportunity  district  in  a  different  part  of  the  State.”  M.D.A. \nApp. 96a. But the two districts in which they increased the Latino \npopulation  provided  no  offset  because  they  were  “already \nperforming for Latinos.” See id.  \n\n3  CVAP  percentages  are  calculated  using  five-year  rolling \nAmerican  Community  Survey  (ACS)  data  from  the  Census \nBureau.  See U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Voting Age Population by \nCitizenship  and  Race  (CVAP),  https://tinyurl.com/CVAPData \n(last  visited  Mar. 19,  2018).  Using  2005-2009  data,  HD32  was \n44.2% HCVAP, and HD34 was 64.6% HCVAP; using 2008-2012 \ndata, both districts’ HCVAP percentages had increased, showing \nthat  Latinos  formed  an  increasing  share  of  Nueces  County’s \npotential electorate. See M.D.A. App. 101a.",
        "7 \n\nexplanation  given  by  Defendants”  at  trial—“that \nmapdrawers  sought  to  draw  HD34  as  a  district  that \nwould  perform  reliably  for  Latino  voters”—was \n“demonstrably  not  the  reason  for  the  population \ndisparity.” H.J.S. App. 255a n.81. \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nshowed \n\nInstead, \n\nthe \nevidence \nmapdrawers—“including  specifically”  Todd  Hunter, \nan  Anglo  incumbent  from  Nueces  County—drew  the \ndistricts  in  that  county  to  “undermine  Latino  voting \nstrength.”  H.J.S.  App.  136a.  The  “convoluted  line” \nbetween HD32 and HD34, id. 132a (quoting the United \nStates’s  post-trial  brief),  included  ten  split  precincts. \nThis  “indicat[ed]  that  mapdrawers  were  likely  using \nrace to assign population since accurate political data \nis  not  available  below  the  precinct  level.”  Id.  136a. \nThat  “jagged  boundary  line”  included  a  “strategic” \nboot-shaped “extension” that resulted in the safe Anglo \ndistrict’s  capturing  a  Latino  area  that  was  “low-\nperforming”  with  “low  turnout.”  M.D.A.  App.  102a. \nMeanwhile,  the  extension  “removed  [from  the  safe \nAnglo district] two potential Hispanic rivals” who had \nlegislative \nof  whom  was  a \nRepublican.  M.D.A.  App.  102a; see id.  90a.  In  short, \nthe Legislature “intentionally packed Hispanic voters” \ninto a safe Latino district “to minimize their number \nand  influence”  in  Nueces  County’s  other  district. \nH.J.S. App. 136a. \n\nexperience—one \n\nThe  district \n\nthe \ncourt  also \nconfiguration of HD32 and HD34 violated the “results” \n\nfound \n\nthat",

See H.J.S. \nApp. 44a-61a.4 \n\nAs  already  described,  the  district  court  found  it \nwas possible to draw two majority-Latino districts, see \nH.J.S. App. 44a, thus satisfying the first precondition \nfor a “results” claim under the framework established \nin Gingles, 478 at 50-51. The district court also found \nthe second and third requirements to be met, given the \n“high  levels  of  racially  polarized  voting  in  Nueces \nCounty.”  H.J.S.  App.  48a-49a.  And  turning  to  the \ntotality-of-the-circumstances \nthe  district \ncourt  emphasized  Texas’s  “long  history”  of  voting-\nrelated  discrimination,  including  “intentional  vote \ndilution  in  the  Legislature’s  enactment  of  the  2011 \nplan,”  id.  51a,  and  the  “continuing  pattern  of \ndisadvantage”  suffered  by  Latinos  in  Nueces  County \nthat hindered their ability to participate effectively in \nthe political process, id. 52a-53a. \n\ninquiry, \n\nThe district court expressly left open the question \nof  an  appropriate  remedy.  H.J.S.  App. 61a.  With \nrespect to the Section 2 “results” violation, it pointed \nto  the  potential  tradeoff  this  Court  had  identified  in \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 480 (2003), between \nfewer but safer districts on the one hand and more, but \nmore  competitive,  districts  on  the  other.  H.J.S. \nApp. 60a.  It  then  advised  appellees  to  consider \nwhether  they  would  press  their  claim  for  a  second \nopportunity district if the two districts had to be drawn \n\n4  Regardless  of  the  intent  with  which  a  jurisdiction \napportions  its  seats,  an  apportionment  plan  violates  Section 2’s \n“results” test “if, based on the totality of circumstances,” minority \ncitizens  show  that  they  “have  less  opportunity  than  other \nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process \nand to elect representatives of their choice.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b).",

Id. 60a-61a.  \n\n2. Bell County. Killeen, Bell County’s largest city, \nhas  a  diverse,  and  growing,  majority-minority \npopulation.  M.D.A.  283a;  see H.J.S.  App.  181a-82a. \nUnder  the  pre-2011  apportionment,  the  entire  city, \nsave  a  “minuscule,  200-resident  split,”  was  located \nwithin  HD54.  Id.  270a.  The  pre-2011  HD54  also \ncontained  all  of  Burnet  and  Lampasas  Counties. \nM.D.A. App. 277a. \n\nAfter  the  2010  census,  HD54  was  overpopulated \nby nearly 29,000 people. M.D.A. App. 278a. “Minority \npopulation growth [had] accounted for more than 70% \nof  the  growth  in  Bell  and  Lampasas  Counties”  since \n2000. Id. Because Bell and Burnet Counties were now \ntoo  populous  to  share  a  district,  Plan  H283  removed \nBurnet  County  and  its  42,000  residents  from  HD54. \nId.; H.J.S. App. 270a. \n\nTo  make  up  for  the  removed  population,  the \nLegislature  needed  to  add  13,000  people  to  HD54. \nH.J.S. App. 270a. Minority members of the Legislature \nintroduced plans “that would have kept [Killeen] more \nwhole” than did Plan H283, “but they were rejected.” \nId. 19a. “[I]nstead of adding voters to the existing core \nof  HD54,  which  already  contained  almost  the  entire \nCity  of  Killeen,”  id. 179a,  the  Legislature  “removed \nmore population from HD54”—splitting off more than \n30,000  Killeen  residents,  “about  two-thirds  of  whom \nwere  minorities,”  and  assigning  them  to  “already \nheavily Anglo HD55.” Id. 270a-71a. To compensate for \nthat  change,  legislators  moved  “47,000  mostly  Anglo \npersons  [in]  southwest  Bell  County”  from  HD55  to",
        "10 \n\nHD54. Id. 270a. The upshot was that voters of color in \nKilleen found themselves split between two majority-\nAnglo CVAP districts (HD54 and HD55). See id. 183a. \n\nThe primary architect of the lines in Bell County \nwas  HD54  incumbent  Representative  Jimmie  Don \nAycock,  an  Anglo. See M.D.A.  App.  277a-78a.  In  his \ntestimony  at  the  2014  trial,  Aycock  claimed  that  the \nlines were the result of a political compromise with the \nincumbent  in  HD55,  who  was  also  an  Anglo. See id. \n278a.  He  also  attempted  to  explain  why  the \nLegislature had rejected alternative plans that would \nhave kept Killeen together in one district. See H.J.S. \nApp.  182-83a.  For  example,  he  objected  to  one  such \nplan (Plan H201) “because it had a ‘land bridge.’” Id. \nThe court found this objection “pretextual” in light of \nthe fact that Aycock  had voted for Plan H283, which \nitself  has  land  bridges  elsewhere.  Id.  Aycock  also \nadmitted  that  he  tried  to  avoid  creating  a  majority-\nminority  coalition  district  because  it  “would  have \nprobably got me unelected.” M.D.A. App. 279a. \n\nthe \n\ncourt \n\nUltimately, \n\nrejected  Aycock’s \nexplanations  for  splitting  Killeen  as  “not  credible,” \nM.D.A.  App.  283a,  as  well  as  “unconvincing  and \npretextual,”  H.J.S.  App.  19a.  It  found  that  “the \ndecision to split Killeen and the minority community \nwithin it (removing minorities from HD54 and moving \nin  Anglos)  was  to  ensure  that  HD54  and  HD55 \nremained  Anglo-majority  and  to  make  HD54  less \nlikely to perform for minority voters.” Id. Accordingly, \nthe  court  concluded  that  in  adopting  Plan  H283,  the \nLegislature  engaged  in  “intentional  vote  dilution  in \nBell County.” Id. 183a. \n\nThe court also found that the new configurations \nof  HD54  and  HD55  “exacerbated  the  existing",
        "11 \n\npopulation  deviations”  between  the  districts.  H.J.S. \nApp.  271a.  And  the  State  offered  no  legitimate \nexplanation for doing so. See id. Rather, the deviations \nwere  “exceedingly  political  and  racial”:  Legislators \n“intentionally  used  race \nin  a  way  that  would \noverwhelm the remaining Latino voters of HD54 with \nthe new influx of Anglo voters while also stranding a \nlarge portion of Killeen’s minority voters in the already \nheavily  Anglo  HD55,”  diluting \nthe  minority \ncommunity’s  potential  political  strength.  Id.  The \npopulation  deviations  were  thus  another  way  the \nLegislature  illegitimately  reduced  minority  political \nstrength. See id. \n\n3.  Dallas  County.  Although \n\nthe  minority \npopulation in Dallas County had increased by almost \n350,000  in  the  decade  from  2000  to  2010,  its  Anglo \npopulation had decreased by almost 200,000, and the \ncounty had “lost population relative to the state as a \nwhole.” M.D.A. App. 222a. As a result, Dallas County \nwas  allocated  fourteen  state  house  seats  rather  than \nthe sixteen it had held under the benchmark plan. Id. \n\nUnder  the  benchmark  plan,  there  had  been  two \nLatino opportunity districts in the county: HD103 and \nHD104. H.J.S. App. 166a-67a. A third district, HD105, \nwas  among  those  “on  track  to  provide  minority \nopportunity.” Id. 166a. In 2008, it came within 19 votes \nof  electing  the  minority-preferred  candidate  to  the \nstate  house,  and  in  seven  of  nine  statewide  elections \nthat year, the minority’s preferred candidate received \na  majority  of  the  vote  within  HD105.  See M.D.A. \nApp. 220a-21a. \n\nAlthough  the  county’s  minority  population  had \nthe  Anglo \nsubstantially \npopulation,  the  Legislature  drew  no  new  minority \n\nincreased \n\nrelative \n\nto",
        "12 \n\nopportunity  districts  within  the  county  in  2011. \nM.D.A.  App. 222a.  Instead,  it  rejected  a  number  of \nproposals  that  would  have  created  districts  without \nAnglo  majorities.  See id.  237a-40a.  And  it  redrew \nHD105 to ensure that the district would not perform \nfor minorities. See H.J.S. App. 170a. As a result, under \nPlan  H283,  Anglos  controlled  nearly  60%  of  Dallas \nCounty’s  house  seats  with  only  one-third  of  its \npopulation. Id. 166a. \n\nWith  respect  to  the  northeastern  part  of  the \ncounty, the district court found insufficient proof that \nthe  Legislature  had  acted  for  racially  discriminatory \n(rather than partisan) reasons. H.J.S. App. 169a-70a. \nBut  the  court  concluded  that  in  western  Dallas \nCounty,  the  district  lines  for  HD103,  HD104,  and \nHD105  were  drawn  “in  a  racially  discriminatory \nmanner  to \nintentionally  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength.” Id. 170a. \n\nthis \n\nThe  district  court  based \n\nfinding  on \nconsiderable evidence. First, HD103 and HD104—the \ncounty’s  only  majority-Latino  opportunity  districts \nunder Plan H283—were two of the most overpopulated \ndistricts  in  the  county.  M.D.A.  App. 43a;  H.J.S. \nApp. 261a.  Ryan  Downton,  who  assisted \nthe \nLegislature in drawing the districts in Dallas County, \ndid not address Representative Anchia’s objection that \nhis district (HD103) was unnecessarily overpopulated, \nand  Downton  did  not  confer  with  Representative \nAlonzo of HD104 at all. H.J.S. App. 170a, 263a. \n\nSecond, the “bizarre configuration” of district lines \nfor all three districts, M.D.A. App. 244a-45a; see also \nJ.A. 454-58, suggested that minorities had been taken \nfrom  HD105  and  packed  into  HD103  and  HD104. \nHD103 and HD104 had two of the lowest perimeter-to-",
        "13 \n\narea compactness scores in the 2011 plan. M.D.A. App. \n244a. HD105’s design was also “a drastic change from \nthe benchmark.” H.J.S. App. 262a. The court noted an \n“HD103 arm” reaching west into HD105, scooping up \nheavily  concentrated  Latino  populations  in  Irving. \nM.D.A.  App. 228a-29a.  It  also  described  a  “jagged, \nbizarrely  shaped”  protrusion  extending  from  HD105 \ninto  HD104,  which  took  “disproportionately  Anglo” \npopulations  from  HD104  and  added  them  to  HD105. \nId.  230a-31a;  see also H.J.S.  App. 262a  (describing \nHD105’s protrusion into HD104 as “the least Hispanic \nchannel that could have been drawn”). \n\nThird,  the  manner  in  which  the  districts  were \ndrawn  also  defied  traditional,  nonracial  districting \ncriteria. The boundary of HD105, for instance, “breaks \nup  numerous  communities  of  interest,”  dividing  the \ncities of Grand Prairie and Irving. M.D.A. App. 230a. \nThe  district  lines  also  split  a  significant  number  of \nprecincts,  including  ten  in  HD103’s  arm  into  HD105 \nand seven that diverted Latino populations in Grand \nPrairie into HD104. Id. 228a, 241a. Residents of split \nwere \nprecincts \nin \nincluded \n“disproportionately  Hispanic”;  those \nHD105 were “disproportionately Anglo.” Id. 231a. \n\nexcluded \n\nHD105 \n\nfrom \n\nDownton,  the  principal  architect  of  the  Dallas \nCounty districts, admitted at trial that he “drew lines \nand  split  precincts  based  on  race  to  put  Anglos  in \nHD105”  and  to  “put  Latinos  in  HD103  and  HD104.” \nM.D.A.  App. 255a.  And  the  fact  that  western  Dallas \nCounty  had  so  many  split  precincts  led  the  Court  to \nconclude that the mapdrawers were relying on race to \nmanipulate  district  lines  and  enhance  the  political \nperformance  of  the  districts  for  Anglos.  H.J.S.  App.",
        "14 \n\n171a; see id. 136a (explaining that “accurate political \ndata is not available below the precinct level”).5 \n\nDownton claimed to have packed minority voters \ninto  HD103  and  HD104  to  comply  with  the  Voting \nRights  Act,  but  the  district  court  deemed  Downton’s \nstatement  “not  credible.”  H.J.S.  App. 171a-72a.  The \ncourt  noted  in  particular  that  “there  [was]  no \nindication that any election analysis was done” to see \nwhether  HD103  and  HD104  needed  additional \nminority  population  in  order  to  remain  opportunity \ndistricts. Id.  172a.  In  light  of  the  other  evidence,  the \ncourt  determined  that  Downton’s  reliance  on  the \nVoting Rights Act was “superficial” and “in bad faith.” \nId.  171a-72a.  It  found  that  “the  true  motive”  of  the \ndistrict  configurations  “was  to  dilute  Latino  voting \nstrength  in  west  Dallas  County  by  unnecessarily \nplacing  Latinos  in  HD103  and  HD104”—that  is, \npacking  them  into  those  districts  to  “waste  Latino \nvotes”—“while  simultaneously  making  HD105  more \nAnglo.” Id. 172a. Based on this “compelling” evidence, \nid. 263a,  the  court  ruled  that  HD103,  HD104,  and \nHD105  had  been  intentionally  designed  to  dilute \nLatino voting strength. \n\n2012: The interim remedy  \n\n1. Because Texas was then a jurisdiction covered \nby  the  preclearance  obligation  of  Section  5  of  the \nVoting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10304, Texas could not \nimmediately implement the legislative apportionment \nembodied  in  Plan  H283.  It  sought  preclearance  from \n\n5  As  the  United  States  argued  at  trial,  splitting  precincts \nalso disproportionately depresses voter turnout among minority \nvoters.

Ct. 2885 (2013). \n\nAt roughly the same time, a number of plaintiffs—\nincluding appellees here—filed suit in the U.S. District \nCourt  for  the  Western  District  of  Texas  challenging \nPlan H283 on a variety of constitutional and statutory \ngrounds. The district court held off adjudicating their \nclaims,  awaiting  decision  from  the  D.D.C.  on  the \nState’s  preclearance  request.  See H.J.S.  App. 318a. \nWhen  it  became  clear  that  the  D.D.C.  would  not \npreclear  Plan H283  in  time  for  the  beginning  of  the \n2012  election  cycle,  the  district  court  had  to \n“implement[]  an  interim  plan  so  that  the  2012 \nelections  [could]  go  forward.” Id.  302a.  To  meet  that \nobligation, in the fall of 2011 the district court “dr[e]w \nan ‘independent map’ following ‘neutral principles that \nadvance the interest of the collective public good.’” See \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 396 (quoting the district court). That \nmap was known as Plan H302. \n\n2. That independent, court-drawn map no longer \nhas anything to do with this case. Texas immediately \nchallenged  Plan H302.  In  its  appeal  to  this  Court, \nTexas  argued  that  the  district  court  should  instead \nhave deferred, to the maximum extent possible, to the \npolicy  decisions  embodied  in  the  Legislature’s  Plan \nH283. \n\nThis Court agreed. It held that the district court \nhad erred in drawing its own plan. Perry, 565 U.S. at \n392, 396. The Court remanded the case to the district \ncourt  and  ordered  that  court  to  defer  to  “the  State’s \npolicy  judgments”  and  to  “take  guidance  from  the \nfrom \nState’s \n\nrecently  enacted  plan”—that \n\nis,",

Id. at 394. \n\n3.  This  Court  issued  its  decision  on  January  20, \n2012, at which point the district court had just over a \nmonth  to  respond  before  the  2012  election  cycle  got \nunderway.  Adhering  to  this  Court’s  directive,  the \ndistrict  court  abandoned  its  independently  drawn \nmap.  After  submissions  from  the  parties,  the  court \nadopted an interim remedy, denominated Plan H309. \nOrder  at  1  (Feb.  28,  2012)  (ECF  No.  682).  The  court \nemphasized that the “interim plan is not a final ruling \non the merits of any claims asserted by the Plaintiffs \nin this case or any of the other cases consolidated with \nthis case.” Id. at 1-2.

        "17 \n\ntried to draw a district that would look Hispanic, but \nperform  for  Anglos”).  HD149  in  Harris  County  had \nbeen 62% minority CVAP in the benchmark plan. See \nH.J.S.  App.  312a.  But  the  Legislature  “chose  to \ndismantle”  this  diverse,  multiracial  district  that  was \nelecting  the  State’s  “first  and  only  Vietnamese-\nAmerican legislator.” Id. 311a. And in El Paso County, \nthe  district  court  found  that  the  line  drawn  between \nHD77  and  HD78  was  “bizarre,  even  for  a  legislative \ndistrict.” H.J.S. App. 313a. HD77 sported a set of “‘deer \nantler’  protrusions”  designed  to  “grab  predominantly \nLatino  neighborhoods,”  id.,  thereby  protecting  the \nincumbent  in  HD78  who  was  not  the  choice  of  the \nLatino community.  \n\nThe 2012 opinion disposed of nearly all appellees’ \nother claims—including those concerning the districts \nnow before this Court— in a single sentence, reciting \nthat the court had “preliminarily” found no likelihood \nof  success  on  appellees’  remaining  “Section  2  and \nconstitutional  challenges,”  H.J.S.  App.  303a.  With \nrespect  to  Nueces  County,  the  court  offered  an \nadditional one-sentence explanation of why the State \ncould  eliminate  one  of  the  benchmark  Latino \nopportunity  districts:  “Because  Nueces  County  does \nnot  have  a  majority \n[Spanish  surname  voter \nregistration (“SSVR”)] as a whole, the choice to remove \none  district  required  the  elimination  of  one  of  the \nHispanic ability districts.” Id. 308a.7 \n\n7 The district court later explained that the State’s  earlier \n“insist[ence],” H.J.S. App. 134a, on using SSVR—rather than on \nCVAP,  with  respect  to  which  Nueces  County  was  majority \nHispanic—as  the  exclusive  measure  of  potential  Latino  voting \nstrength reinforced the court’s finding of discriminatory purpose. \nSee infra pages 38-39.",
        "18 \n\nThe  result  of  the  preliminary  ruling  was  that \nevery one of the districts currently at issue in Nueces, \nBell, or Dallas Counties was “left undisturbed from the \nenacted  plan”  and  “configure[d]”  in  an  “identical \nmanner”  to  its  configuration  in  the  Legislature’s \nPlan H283. See H.J.S. App. 303a & n.4 (capitalization \naltered). The only reason these districts needed to be \nincluded in the court’s interim remedial order was that \nbecause  they  had  not  yet  been  precleared,  only  a \nfederal court order could allow them to go into effect. \n\nThe  district  court  took  pains  to  “emphasize  the \npreliminary  and  temporary  nature”  of  its  interim \norder,  stressing  that  “except  for  the  fact  that  PLAN \nH309 sets the districts for the 2012 elections, nothing \nin this opinion reflects this Court’s final determination \nof  any  legal  or  factual  matters.”  H.J.S.  App.  303a, \n314a.  As  the  court  later  explained,  it  had  been  clear \nfrom the outset that its “analysis had been expedited \nand  curtailed”  and  that  its  conclusions  could  “be \nrevised upon full analysis.” Id. 319a. \n\nSix  months  after  the  court  issued  the  order \nadopting  interim  Plan  H309,  the  D.D.C.    held  that \nPlan H283 was retrogressive. Texas, 887 F. Supp. 2d \nat 166. Accordingly, that court did not then resolve the \nquestion  whether  the  plan  was  also  purposefully \ndiscriminatory. But it pointed to “record evidence that \ncause[d]  concern” and “strongly suggest[ed]” that the \nretrogression  “may  not  have  been  accidental.” Id.  at \n177-78. \n\n2013:  Enacting \napportionment \n\nthe  current  state  house \n\n1.  In  2013,  in  the  wake  of  the  decisions  by  the \ncourt below and the D.D.C. and while Texas’s appeal",
        "19 \n\nof  the  denial  of  preclearance  was  still  pending,  the \nGovernor called a special session of the Legislature “to \ninterim  map”  as  a \nadopt  the  [district  court’s] \npermanent apportionment. H.J.S App. 5a.  \n\nIt  is  important  to  remember  that  the  “interim \nmap”  involved  two  distinct  classes  of  districts.  First, \nthe  court  below  had  redrawn  28  of  Plan  H283’s \ndistricts,  21  of  them  “substantially,”  in  light  of  its \npreliminary  finding  that  the  existing  configurations \nviolated  federal  law.  H.J.S  App.  313a-14a.  Those \ndistricts—none of which is now before this Court—can \nfairly  be  described  as  court-drawn  or  court-imposed. \nSecond,  the  court  had  left  122  districts  “exactly  the \nsame as those in the enacted plan”—that is, identical \nto the districts the Legislature had drawn in 2011 as \npart of Plan H283. Id. 314a. As to these districts, the \ncourt had simply “defer[red]” to “the legislative choices \nand district lines” made in Plan H283. Id. 356a n.42.8 \n\nThe district court found that the Legislature was \naware that pending challenges to the districts that had \noriginated in Plan H283 and had remained unchanged \nsince 2011 were likely to continue. H.J.S. App. 356a. It \nemphasized  that  “[t]he  Legislature’s  own  attorney, \nJeff Archer, advised them” of this probability. Id.; see \nalso id. 358a & n.45. \n\nThe  district  court \n\nfound  that  the  decision \nnevertheless  to  retain  the  original  configuration  of \nthese  “undisturbed”  districts,  H.J.S.  App.  303a,  “was \nnot an attempt to adopt plans that fully complied with \nthe  VRA  and  the  Constitution”;  rather,  “it  was  a \n\n8 The district court’s findings “concerning the intent of the \n2013  Legislature”  are  laid  out  in  its  order  on  Plan  C235.  See \nH.J.S. App. 6a.",
        "20 \n\nlitigation  strategy  designed  to  insulate”  the  districts \n“from  further  challenge,  regardless  of  their  legal \ninfirmities.” Id.  355a.  The  Legislature  hoped  that  by \nrepealing the 2011 plan, the State could somehow wipe \nout  the  evidentiary  significance  of  any  findings  of \ndiscriminatory  intent  in  the  initial  design  of  the \ndistricts because it could then argue that that evidence \napplied only to a plan that no longer existed. Id. 357a-\n58a. The Legislature could then immediately reenact \ntime  without \nexactly  the  same  districts—this \ndiscussion or debate or consideration of alternatives—\nand then argue that the silence provided no evidence \nto support a claim that the districts had been drawn \nfor discriminatory reasons. This would enable Texas to \n“maintain the benefit of [the prior] discrimination.” Id. \n358a.  The  district  court \nthis  strategy \nfound \n“discriminatory at its heart.” Id. 359a. \n\nPursuing  this  repeal-and-reenact  strategy,  the \nLegislature  “pushed  the  [2013]  redistricting  bills \nthrough  quickly.”  H.J.S.  App.  354a.  There  was  no \n“deliberative  process  to  ensure  that  the  2013  plans \ncured  any  taint  from  the  2011  plans.”  Id.  353a. \nInstead,  “the  Legislature  continued  its  steadfast \nrefusal”  to  consider  creating  additional  minority \nopportunity  districts,  id.,  rejecting  out  of  hand \namendments proposed by Latino legislators, see, e.g., \nid.  61a-62; Trial Tr. at  281  (July 14,  2017)  (ECF  No. \n1546). But the Legislature did agree to an amendment \nproposed by an Anglo legislator that redrew one of the \nchallenged  districts  in  a  way  that  introduced  new \nconstitutional infirmities. See infra pages 23-25. \n\nIn  contrast  to  the  bill  enacting  districts  for  the \nU.S.  House  of  Representatives,  which  expressly \n“ratified and adopted” the “interim redistricting plan”",
        "21 \n\nthat had been “ordered” by the district court, Texas Br. \nStat.  App.  34a-35a,  the  bill  enacting  the  new  state \nhouse  districts  made  no  mention  of  the  2012 \npreliminary  order.  It  simply  listed  the  census  tracts \ncontained within each district. See id. 1a-32a. \n\nThe Legislature’s 2013 apportionment is known as \nPlan H358.  The  district  court  described  the  plan  as \n“heavily  derived  from  the  2011  plans.”  Order  at  13 \n(Sept. 6,  2013)  (ECF  No. 886).  With  respect  to  the \ndistricts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  now \nbefore this Court, that is an understatement. Six are \nidentical  to  the  districts  initially  drawn  by  the \nlegislature  in  2011:  HD32  and  HD  34  in  Nueces \nCounty; HD54 and HD55 in Bell County; and HD104 \nand  HD105  in  Dallas  County.  A  seventh,  HD103  in \nDallas  County,  was  changed  only  slightly  through  a \npopulation  swap  with  HD115.  H.J.S.  App.  23a.9  The \neighth district, HD90 in Tarrant County, was redrawn \nby the Legislature. Id. 70a. \n\n2.  The  district  court  made  clear  that  its  general \nfindings regarding the purpose behind the enactment \nof  Plan  H358  applied  to  the  districts  at  issue  in \nNueces, Bell, and Dallas Counties. \n\nWith  respect  to  the  Nueces  County  districts,  the \ncourt  acknowledged  that  it  had  “not  alter[ed]  the \ndistricts in [its interim 2012] Plan H309.” H.J.S. App. \n28a.  But  it  explained  that  it  had  then  “lacked  the \nbenefit  of  the  full  record  in  making  its  preliminary \ndeterminations.” Id.  For  example,  in  2012,  the  court \nhad “focused on” SSVR, the State’s proffered measure \nof  Hispanic  population—a  measure  under  which  “it \n\n9 No party has challenged that swap. H.J.S. App. 23a.",
        "22 \n\nwas mathematically impossible to draw two Hispanic \ndistricts  wholly  within”  Nueces  County. Id. 27a-28a. \nBut a “review of the full record” revealed that the State \nknew  that  under  a  different,  more  commonly  used \nmeasure,  “the  HCVAP  of  Nueces  County  was \ncomfortably  above  50%,”  making  two  Hispanic-\nmajority  districts  possible. Id.  28a  n.19.  And  yet  the \nState “did not look into whether two majority-HCVAP \nLatino opportunity districts could be maintained.” Id. \n27a. \n\nBased on the full record, the court found both that \nthe  Legislature  had  drawn  the  Nueces  County \ndistricts in 2011 for discriminatory purposes and that \nbecause \n“remain[ed] \nunchanged”  in  the  2013  plan,  H.J.S.  App.  30a,  “that \ndiscrimination  was  purposefully  maintained  in  Plan \nH358,” id. 60a. \n\ntainted  district \n\nlines \n\nthe \n\nWith respect to the Bell County districts, the court \nmade a similar finding. There, too, the lines drawn by \nthe Legislature in 2011 were carried forward into Plan \nH358  “unchanged.”  H.J.S.  App.  20a.  The  court  had \nearlier  found  that  in  configuring  the  Bell  County \ndistricts,  Representative  Aycock  had  deliberately \n“divided the growing minority City of Killeen to protect \nhis incumbency.” M.D.A. App. 289a. The district court \nfound that “the 2013 Legislature intended to continue \nthe  intentional  discrimination  found  in  Plan  H283” \nwith  respect  to  the  partition  of  Killeen.  H.J.S.  App.  \n22a.  Thus,  the  racially  discriminatory  “intent  and \nharm remain in Plan H358.” Id. \n\nFinally, the court found that the State’s unlawful \nintent to minimize minority voting strength in western \nDallas  County  remained  unchanged  in  reenacting \nsubstantially  identical  districts  in  Plan  H358.  H.J.S.",
        "23 \n\nApp. 26a. HD 105’s configuration had been designed to \nensure  that  Latino  voters,  nearing  the  ability  to \nunseat  a  representative  who  did  not  reflect  their \nvalues,  were  frustrated  in  that  political  effort.  Id. \n167a.  Nothing  in  the  new  plan  “remove[d]  or \nremed[ied] the intentional discrimination” inflicted in \nthat part of the County. Id. 26a. \n\n3. Unlike the other districts now before this Court, \nHD90 in Tarrant County (the home of Fort Worth) was \ngiven  its  current  configuration  in  2013.  H.J.S. \nApp. 70a.  In  2011,  rejecting  a  proposal  by  Anglo \nincumbent Lon Burnham that would have lowered the \nHCVAP of the district to 43.2%, see M.D.A. App. 12a, \n259a-60a, the Legislature had adopted a configuration \nthat was 49.7% HCVAP and 50.1% SSVR, id. 266a.  \n\nIn 2012, Burnam very narrowly defeated a Latino \nopponent  in  the  Democratic  primary.  Voting  was \nracially polarized; Burnam’s Latino opponent received \n70.6%  of  the  Latino  vote  while  Burnam  received  the \nmajority of Anglo and African-American votes. H.J.S. \nApp.  72a.  So  in  2013,  Burnam  sought  to  revamp  the \ndistrict’s  boundaries  to  bring  the  Como  community \nback  into  HD90.  That  community  (which  is  heavily \nnon-Latino)  “had  consistently  and  overwhelmingly \nsupported him” in the past. Id. 83a. At the same time, \nBurnam  strove  to  ensure  that  HD90  remained \nnominally  a  majority-Latino  district  with  respect  to \nSSVR,  id.  73a,  because  the  Chairman  of  the  House \nRedistricting  Committee,  Drew  Darby,  was  “fixated” \non that figure, id. 82a. \n\nTo accomplish both goals, Burnam and his chief of \nstaff,  Conor  Kenney,  made  unabashed  use  of  race. \nBurnam directed Kenney to split precincts and swap \ncensus  blocks  to  add  Latino  population  and  exclude",
        "24 \n\nAnglo  population  in  order  to  counterbalance  the \naddition  of  Como.  He  admitted  that  “we  really  made \nsome ugly lines” and “got rid of every white voter near \nthe  western  boundary  of  the  district  to  keep  the \nHispanic  vote  over  50  percent,  but  to  get  Como  back \ninto the district.” H.J.S. App. 73a. Kenney “started by \nswapping  whole  precincts  between  the  districts,  but \nquickly  began  trading  populations  at  the  block  level, \nusing  racial  shading  and \n[Hispanic  voting-age \npopulation] as a proxy for SSVR.” Id. Burnam testified \nthat  concern  about  population  deviations  got  “lost  in \nthe  process”  because  “we  had  to  deal  with  taking  as \nmany white folks out as we could.” Id. 74a. \n\nand  Hispanic \n\nDuring  the  floor  debate  on  the  redistricting  bill, \nBurnam  explained  his  amendment  to  the  other \nlegislators  this  way:  it  would  “take  the  African \nAmerican \nof \nRepresentative Geren’s district and put[] some of my \nAnglo  population  into  his  district.”  H.J.S.  App.  75a. \nChairman Darby then urged the members to approve \nthe amendment, stating that Burnam’s final proposal \n“br[ought] the numbers back over 50%.” Id. 81a. The \namendment passed. \n\npopulation \n\nout \n\nThe district court found that while HD90 did not \nintentionally  dilute  Latino  voting  strength—as  it \nhappened, a Latino challenger defeated Burnam in the \n2014  primary,  H.J.S.  App.  76a—the  district  was  an \nunconstitutional  racial  gerrymander  under \nthe \nstandard laid out by this Court in Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. 630 (1993), and its progeny. See H.J.S. App. 71a-\n84a. The court pointed to the “strong direct evidence” \nin  Burnam  and  Kenney’s  testimony  “explicitly \nacknowledging the use of race in their method” as well \nas Burnam’s testimony “speaking candidly about there",
        "25 \n\nbeing ‘too many white people’ in HD90.” Id. 77a. The \ncourt  termed  Burnam’s  floor  statements  about  “as \nnaked  a  confession  as  there  can  be  to  moving  voters \ninto and out of districts purely on the basis of race.” Id. \n81a. \n\nApplying  strict  scrutiny,  the  district  court  ruled \nthat the State’s “use of race in drawing HD90 was not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government \ninterest.”  H.J.S.  App.  82a-83a.  The  court  saw  no \nevidence that anyone considered the racial target “in \nterms  of  compliance  with  the  VRA.”  Id.  82a.  In \nparticular,  none  of  the  witnesses  provided  “any \nmeaningful testimony as to the potential significance \nof a 50% SSVR threshold.” Id. Based on this evidence, \nand  its  evaluation  of  the  witnesses’  credibility,  the \ncourt  found  that  the  State’s  invocation  at  trial  of \nVoting  Rights  Act  compliance  to  justify  its  focus  on \nrace lacked a “strong basis in evidence.” Id. 81a. \n\nProceedings below \n\n1.  In  response  to  Plan H358’s  enactment,  a \nnumber of the plaintiffs (appellees here) received leave \nto  amend  their  complaints  (which  had  originally \nchallenged the 2011 legislative apportionment in Plan \nH283). See H.J.S. App. 324a-25a. \n\nOne  set  of  amendments  related  to  appellees’ \nclaims  against  Plan H283:  Because  this  Court’s \ndecision in Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 \n(2013),  had  released  Texas \nfrom  preclearance, \nappellees sought relief under Section 3(c) of the Voting \nRights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10302(c), seeking to reimpose",
        "26 \n\na preclearance requirement on the State. H.J.S. App. \n324a.10 \n\nA second set of amendments brought challenges to \nPlan 358 under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and \nvarious strands of the Fourteenth Amendment. H.J.S. \nApp. 325a. \n\n2.  In  2017,  after  a  lengthy  multipart  trial,  the \ndistrict  court  issued  a  voluminous  set  of  opinions.  It \nupheld many districts that one or another plaintiff had \nchallenged.  See, e.g., H.J.S.  App.  11a-12a,  17a-18a, \n67a-68a,  85a.  But  with  respect  to  the  districts  now \nbefore this Court, the district court found intentional \nthe  Fourteenth \ndiscrimination \nAmendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. (It \nalso  found  that  the  Nueces  County  districts  violated \nSection 2’s “results” test.) \n\nviolated \n\nthat \n\nThe district court held that the discrimination had \nto be “remedied.” H.J.S. App. 85a. And it ordered the \nState to tell it whether the Legislature would “take up \nredistricting in an effort to cure these violations and, \nif  so,  when  the  matter  will  be  considered.”  Id.  86a. \nFinally, it laid out a schedule for the court to analyze \nremedial  possibilities  in  the  absence  of  legislative \naction. Id. \n\n3. Instead of responding to the district court, the \nState sought relief from this Court. On September 12, \n\n10  In Shelby County,  this  Court  struck  down  the  coverage \nformula in Section 4(b) of the Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10303(b). See 133 \nS. Ct. at 2631. Section 3(c) of the Act authorizes a court that finds \nconstitutional  violations  to  order  that  a  jurisdiction  seek \npreclearance  of  any  future  changes  to  its  voting  laws  “for  such \nperiod  as  [the  court]  may  deem  appropriate.”  52  U.S.C. \n§ 10302(c).",
        "27 \n\n2017, this Court granted a stay of the district court’s \norder. Abbott v. Perez, No. 17A245. In January of this \nyear, it set the case for argument, postponing decision \non the question of jurisdiction. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nTexas seeks to preempt, rather than appeal from, \nan  order  granting  or  denying  injunctive  relief.  Its \nappeal  is  thus  premature,  and  this  Court  lacks \njurisdiction to hear it. \n\nBut if this Court concludes otherwise, its task is a \nstraightforward  one.  Texas  and  the  United  States \nstake  their  arguments  on  the  proposition  that  the \nchallenged  districts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas \nCounties are “court-drawn,” “court-imposed,” or part of \na court’s “own plan.” That premise is untrue. Once this \nCourt  recognizes  that  the  challenged  districts  are \nlegislatively drawn, first and last, the argument that \nthis  Court  should  accord  Texas’s  decision  a \n“particularly strong” “presumption of good faith,” U.S. \nBr. 24, collapses. \n\nMoreover,  because  the  districts  in  Nueces,  Bell, \nand  Dallas  Counties  were  crafted  by  the  Texas \nLegislature  in  2011  and  carried  forward  essentially \nunchanged  into  the  current  apportionment  statute, \nthe  district  court  was  correct  to \nlook  at  the \nLegislature’s  intent  in  both  2011  and  2013.  Texas \noffers only perfunctory responses to the district court’s \nfactual  findings  with  respect  to  the  discriminatory \ngenesis of the challenged districts. The district court’s \ndetailed  findings  of  fact,  with  respect  to  both  the \ndiscriminatory  intent  with  which  the  districts  were \ndrawn  in  2011  and  the  discriminatory  intent  with \nwhich  those  district  lines  were  carried  forward  in",
        "28 \n\n2013, should be affirmed under the standard set out in \nRule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and \napplied  consistently  by  this  Court  in  redistricting \ncases. This Court should not permit Texas to launder \nits tainted districts by passing them through a district \ncourt  decision  that  did  nothing  more  than  decline  to \nenter a preliminary injunction against them. \n\nTexas is also wrong to claim that a district drawn \nwith racially discriminatory intent cannot violate the \nFourteenth  Amendment  or  Section  2  of  the  Voting \nRights  Act  unless  plaintiffs  satisfy  the  threshold \nrequirements  for  establishing  a  Section 2  “results” \nclaim.  To  the  contrary:  As  long  as  a  purposefully \ndiscriminatory  apportionment  has  a  discernible \ndiscriminatory effect, it violates the Constitution and \nSection  2  regardless  whether  it  would  be  possible  to \ndraw additional majority-nonwhite districts. And with \nrespect to the Nueces County Section 2 “results” claim, \nTexas’s arguments go only to the question of remedy, \nnot the question of liability.  \n\nFinally, with respect to HD90, the State does not \ncontest  the  district  court’s  finding  that  race  was  the \npredominant motive for how the lines were drawn in \n2013.  Nor  could  it.  It  claims  only  that  the  district \nsurvives strict scrutiny because the Legislature had a \n“strong basis” for considering race in order to comply \nwith Section 2. Texas Br. 68. The district court rejected \nthat  claim  because  it  found  “no  evidence  that  any \nlegislator  or  staffer”  considered  the  “effect  on  Latino \nvoting  ability  in  HD90”  when  drawing  the  district’s \nboundaries.  H.J.S.  App.  81a-82a.  Thus,  as  with  the \ndistricts in the other three counties, the State simply \nrepeats its version of the facts, completely ignoring the",
        "29 \n\ndistrict  court’s  contrary  factual  findings  and  the \napplicable standard of review in this Court. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  The Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of \n\njurisdiction. \n\nThe time it takes to litigate redistricting cases is \nfrustrating  to  everyone,  appellees  most  of  all.  Under \nthe best-case scenario, a majority of the elections this \ndecade will have been held under a plan that violates \nthe Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. But that \ndevastating  fact  cannot  confer  jurisdiction  on  this \nCourt to hear Texas’s appeal. If this Court were to buy \nTexas’s jurisdictional argument, the upshot would be \nmany more cases in which justice is delayed. \n\n1. Texas blows by the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1253,  which  gives  this  Court  jurisdiction  to  hear \nappeals  from  three-judge  district  courts  only  with \nrespect  to  “order[s]  granting  or  denying . . .  an \ninterlocutory  or  permanent  injunction.”  Section  1253 \ndoes  not  give  this  Court  appellate  jurisdiction  over \nother sorts of orders, no matter how important those \norders  might  be  to  the  parties.  This  is  so  even  with \nrespect  to  orders  that  conclusively  determine  the \nunconstitutionality of a statute, Gunn v. Univ. Comm. \nto End the War in Viet Nam,  399  U.S.  383,  388-91 \n(1970), or grant declaratory relief, White v. Regester, \n412 U.S. 755, 760-61 (1973); Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 \nU.S.  427,  430-31  (1970)  (per  curiam).  Thus,  in \nGoldstein v. Cox,  396  U.S.  471  (1970),  the  Court \nemphasized  “that  its  jurisdiction  under  the  Three-\nJudge Court Act is to be narrowly construed” because \n“this  Court  above  all  others  must  limit  its  review  of \ninterlocutory orders.” Id. at 478.",
        "30 \n\n2. Ignoring that directive, the United States and \nTexas  seek  to  borrow  a  construction  of  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1292(a)(1)—the  jurisdictional  statute  applicable  to \nthe  courts  of  appeals—that  permits  those  courts  to \nentertain  interlocutory  appeals  beyond  the  “limited \nexception to the final-judgment rule” provided by the \nsection itself, Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, \n84  (1981).  In  exceptional  circumstances,  a  party  can \nappeal even absent the grant or denial of an injunction \nif a district court’s order has the “practical effect” of an \ninjunction. See Texas Br. 19 (quoting Carson, 450 U.S. \nat 83); see also U.S. Br. 20. \n\nNeither Texas nor the United States cites a single \ncase  in  which  this  Court  has  adopted  that  loose \nconstruction with respect to Section 1253. Indeed, such \na  relaxation  would  directly  contravene  this  Court’s \ndeclaration in Goldstein. \n\nIn fact, this Court has squarely refused to create a \n“practical  effect”  exception  to  Section  1253’s  textual \nlimitation. In Gunn, for example, a three-judge court \nstruck down a provision of the Texas Penal Code. 399 \nU.S. at 384-86. Like the district court below, the court \nin Gunn  gave  the  state  legislature  an  opportunity  to \ncure the defect rather than immediately enjoining the \nprovision. Id. at 386. Under the theory the State has \npressed  here,  one  would  expect  this  Court  to  have \nentertained  the  appeal  in Gunn because  the  district \ncourt’s legal ruling, together with its suggestion that \nthe  state  remedy  the  defect,  “put[]  the  state  on  the \nclock” to amend its law or face remedial proceedings, \nTexas Br. 23. \n\nBut  this  Court  held  that  it  lacked  jurisdiction. \nThat  was  not  because  the  Court  overlooked  the \npractical effect of the district court’s ruling. The Court",
        "31 \n\na \n\ncourt \n\nopinion \n\nholding \n\nrecognized  that  a  state  official  “confronted”  with  a \nfederal \nstatute \nunconstitutional “would no doubt hesitate long before \ndisregarding it.” Gunn, 399 U.S. at 390. Nevertheless, \nthis Court saw “no power” to “deal with the merits of \nth[e] case in any way at all” because no injunction had \nbeen granted or denied. Id. This principle applies with \nequal force in the context of redistricting. In Whitcomb \nv. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971), the Court rejected an \ninitial  appeal  filed  after  the  three-judge  court  ruled \nthat  a  state  legislative  district  was  unconstitutional; \nthe  Court  lacked  jurisdiction  because  “no  injunction \nhad been granted or denied.” Id. at 138 n.19. \n\nTexas  makes  no  effort  to  address  Gunn  or \nWhitcomb.  Instead,  it  tries  to  deflect  attention  by \nclaiming  that  the  order  here  has  “the  exact  same \npractical effect” as the orders underlying this Court’s \nexercise of jurisdiction in Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. \n1455 (2017), and Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161 (U.S.). \nTexas Br. 22. \n\nBut the orders from which the parties appealed in \nthose  two  cases  satisfied  the  textual  requirement  of \nSection  1253.  In  both  cases,  the  district  court  had \nexpressly enjoined state officials from conducting any \nfuture elections under the challenged plan.11 Thus, the \nofficials in those cases, unlike the officials here, were \n\n11  See Whitford v. Gill,  No. 3:15-cv-00421-bbc,  2017  WL \n2623104,  at  *1  (W.D.  Wis.  Feb.  22,  2017)  (three-judge  court) \n(“defendants are enjoined from using the [challenged] districting \nplan . . . in all future elections”); Harris v. McCrory, No. 1:13-cv-\n00949-WO-JEP, at 1 (M.D.N.C. Feb. 5, 2016) (three-judge court) \n(ECF No. 143) (state officials are “enjoined from conducting any \nelections  for  the  office  of  U.S.  Representative  until  a  new \nredistricting plan is in place”).",
        "32 \n\nsubject  to  “an  extraordinary  writ,  enforceable  by  the \npower of contempt,” Gunn, 399 U.S. at 389. And it was \nabsolutely  clear  that  no  further  elections  would  take \nplace under the challenged plans. \n\nThe United States at least acknowledges the force \nof Gunn and Whitcomb. U.S. Br. 23. And it pointedly \ndoes  not  embrace  Texas’s  expansive  claim  that  any \nfinding  of  liability  combined  with  the  tautological \nobservation  that  there  needs  to  be  a  remedy  once  a \nviolation  is  found  entitles  a  state  to  invoke  Section \n1253.  But  the  United  States  then  suggests  that \nsomehow \n“timing  pressures  present  here” \ntransform  an  otherwise  unappealable  order  into  an \ninjunction.  U.S.  Br.  23.  It  offers  no  explanation  of \nexactly  how  that  transformation  occurs,  or  any \nstandards  to  guide  future  litigants  in  knowing  when \nan  unappealable  order  becomes  appealable.  And  on \nthe  facts,  the  timeframes  in Whitcomb and  this  case \nare  nearly  identical.12  The  Court  should  reject  this \njury-rigged rule. \n\nthe \n\n3.  Adhering to  the  text  of  Section  1253 is not  an \nexercise  in  arid  formalism.  Allowing  premature \nexcessive \nthreatens  unnecessary  and \nappeals \nlitigation. \n\n12 In Whitcomb, the district court issued an opinion in July \n1969, see 403  U.S.  at  131,  for  an  election  cycle  that  was  set  to \nbegin  in  earnest  right  after  the  New  Year,  see Chavis v. \nWhitcomb, 307 F. Supp. 1362, 1366 (S.D. Ind. 1969) (three-judge \ncourt), and ultimately issued a remedy in October, see Whitcomb, \n403  U.S.  at  139.  Here,  the  district  court  issued  its  opinion  in \nAugust 2017 with the next election cycle set to begin shortly after \nthe New Year. Had Texas complied with the district court’s order, \na remedy could have been in place by October.",
        "33 \n\nsummary \n\nIf Texas is right about when states can invoke this \nCourt’s appellate jurisdiction, then states will be free \nto appeal whenever a three-judge court issues even a \npartial \nin  a  multiparty, \njudgment \nmulticlaim apportionment lawsuit. It is a truism that \nthe  law  must  furnish  a  remedy  for  the  violation  of  a \nright. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 \n(1803).  But  that  hardly  transforms  every  declaration \nof a violation into a de facto injunction. \n\nthat \n\nclaim \n\nTexas’s \n\ninterlocutory  appellate \njurisdiction  is  necessary  to  avoid  the  problem  of \n“extremely  expedited”  review,  Texas  Br.  23,  fares  no \nbetter.  That  argument  attempts  to  convert  timing \npressures caused by  this  appeal  into  justifications in \nfavor of  the appeal itself. Rewarding the State’s efforts \nwould produce a dangerous precedent for purposes of \nSection 1253.  Given  that  primary  and  general \nelections  occur  on  a  two-year  cycle  and  taking  into \naccount the calendar on which this Court operates, one \nparty or another will nearly always be able to assert \nthat  an  election  deadline  is impending  and  therefore \njustifies  this  Court’s  immediate  review.  Exigency  is \nwithout  doubt  a  necessary  condition  for  Section \n1292(a)(1)-style review, see Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, but \nit  is  not  a  sufficient  one,  and  it  cannot  overcome  the \nfact  that  nothing  in  the  order  below  operates  as  an \ninjunction. \n\nTexas  strays  even  further  afield  when  it  claims \nthat it should be allowed to appeal in the absence of an \ninjunction  because  this  would  somehow  “even[]  the \nplaying field” between itself and appellees. Texas Br. \n23.  To  be  sure,  if  appellees’  claims  “had  been \ndefinitively  rejected,”  id.,  appellees  could  have \nappealed.  But  that  is  because  their  request  for",
        "34 \n\ninjunctive  relief  would  necessarily  have  been  denied, \nbringing  them  squarely  within  the  terms  of  Section \n1253.  As  the  case  stands,  however,  no  one  can \n“definitively”  say  in  what  ways  the  State  might  be \nforced to depart from the district lines its Legislature \ndrew.  Far  from  leveling  the  playing  field,  endorsing \nTexas’s  proffered  “[p]ractical  considerations”  as \njustification for its appeal would unjustifiably tip the \nscales in the State’s favor. \n\nMake no mistake: Allowing states to appeal after \na  liability  finding  but  before  any  injunction  virtually \nguarantees that this Court will see recurrent appeals \nin redistricting cases. This would flout the well-settled \nprinciple  that  “piecemeal  appellate  review  is  not \nfavored,”  particularly  under  Section  1253. Goldstein, \n396  U.S.  at  478.  A  state  will  have  every  incentive  to \nappeal after a finding of liability without waiting to see \nwhether a district court will in fact enjoin an upcoming \nelection and without there being any potential remedy \nin place. If it loses, it will no doubt file a second appeal \nif  the  district  court  rejects  its  proffered  remedy  (if  it \neven  proffers  one).  And  of  course  if  a  district  court \naccepts  the  state’s  proposed  remedy,  or  imposes  its \nown,  disappointed  plaintiffs  will  then  appeal.  The \nconsequence will be more litigation, and more delay in \nresolving redistricting cases. \n\nIn short, the district court has neither granted nor \ndenied injunctive relief of any kind. That alone should \ndispose of this appeal. This Court should reject Texas’s \nefforts to bend Section 1253 into a statute permitting \nappeals  any  time  a  state  objects  to  a  ruling  in  a \nredistricting case.",
        "35 \n\nII.  In the alternative, this Court should affirm the \ndistrict  court’s \nthat  Plan  H358 \nfinding \nintentionally dilutes minority voting strength. \n\nIf this Court decides that it has jurisdiction over \nTexas’s  appeal,  then  it  should  accept  the  district \ncourt’s  finding  that  the  Legislature  adopted  and \nmaintained the configurations of the districts at issue \nin  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  for  racially \ndiscriminatory  purposes  and  hold  that  the  districts \nviolate  both  Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  52 \nU.S.C.  § 10301,  and  the  Fourteenth  Amendment. \nTexas’s  and  the  United  States’s  arguments  against \ndoing  so  distort  the  facts,  ignore  the  standard  of \nreview, and misread this Court’s precedents.  \n\nA.  The challenged districts originated in 2011 \nby \nthat  was \nlegislation \ndiscriminatory  motivations  and  not  in  a \ncourt-imposed remedy. \n\ntainted \n\ntainted  by  purposeful \n\n1.  Texas  does  very  little  to  challenge  the  district \ncourt’s  finding  that  the  2011  process  that  produced \nPlan H283  was \nracial \ndiscrimination. (Indeed, Texas implicitly acquiesced in \nthat finding when it abandoned any attempt to defend \nthe  21  districts  the  three-judge  court  “reconfigured,” \nH.J.S.  App.  307a,  after \nits  preliminary  ruling \nregarding  the  districts’  likely  unconstitutionality.) \nAnd the United States actually intervened in this case \nas a plaintiff to assert both that Plan H283 “had been \nin \nadopted  with  racially  discriminatory \nviolation of Section 2 and that Section 3(c) relief was \nwarranted.” U.S. Br. 13. \n\nintent \n\nInstead,  Texas  claims  that  that  finding,  and  the \ndistrict  court’s  detailed  findings  with  respect  to  the",
        "36 \n\ndiscriminatory  intent  that  infected  the  creation  of \nindividual  districts,  is  “legally  irrelevant,”  Texas  Br. \n41,  because  in  Plan  H358  the  Legislature  “adopted \nunchanged  districts  that  the  court  itself ordered the \nState to use in 2012,” id. at 24. \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nchallenged \n\nThe  United  States  at  least  acknowledges  that \nunder this Court’s precedents, the district court could \nproperly “consider[] the ‘historical background of’ and \n‘sequence  of  events  leading  up  to’  enactment  of  the \n2013  redistricting  plans,  including  whether  the  2011 \nLegislature acted with discriminatory intent.” U.S. Br. \n32  n.12  (quoting Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. \nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977)).  But it too \nasserts \ndistricts  were \n“adopted . . . without change from the court’s own 2012 \ninterim plan[].” U.S. Br. 24. Indeed, the United States \ngoes  on  to  propose  that  the  “normal  presumption”  of \nconstitutionality afforded to legislative enactments be \n“heightened  by  the  State’s  acceptance  of  the  judicial \nplan.” Id. at 30. The United States repeatedly invokes \nthat \nstrong,” \npresumption, id. at 24, 32 n.12, 38, 40; see also id. at \n37  (arguing  that  appellees  should  have  to  “adduce \nparticularly  persuasive \nevidence”),  presumably \nbecause it thinks the presumption is indispensable to \nupholding the challenged districts. \n\n“particularly \n\nnewfound, \n\nand \n\nTexas  and  the  United  States  have  gotten  things \nexactly backwards. The district court—at this Court’s \ndirection, see Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 393 (2012) \n(per  curiam)—adopted  the  Legislature’s  plan  with \nregard to these districts; the Legislature did not adopt \nthe court ’s plan. The configurations of the challenged \ndistricts  are  entirely a  product  of  lines  drawn  by  the \nLegislature  in  Plan  H283—as  the  district  court",
        "37 \n\nunanimously  recognized.  Order  at  13  (Sept. 6,  2013) \n(ECF No. 886). The most accurate way to characterize \nthe  record  is  to  say  that  the  Legislature  drew  the \ndistricts in 2011 and that the district court permitted \nthose  unprecleared  districts  to  go  into  effect  for  the \n2012  election.  Indeed,  Texas’s  prior  appeal  to  this \nCourt  was  designed  to  achieve  precisely  that  goal. \nHaving  successfully  argued  in  2012  that  the  court \nbelow should be required to implement Texas’s plan to \nthe  maximum  extent  possible,  Texas  should  not  now \nbe  permitted  to  turn  around  and  claim  that  the \nresulting plan was in fact the court’s idea. \n\n2.  In  any  event,  the district  court’s  2012  interim \n\norder could not provide Texas with a safe harbor. \n\nThe  district  court’s  2012  order  was  avowedly \n“preliminary,”  H.J.S.  App.  303a,  314a,  and  explicitly \ndisclaimed  any  “final  determination  of  any  legal  or \nfactual  matters,”  id.  303a.  And  as  Texas  itself \nacknowledged at the time, it is “well established” that \nany  finding  “made  in  connection  with  an  award  of \npreliminary relief is not a final ruling on the merits.” \nReply Br. for Appellants at 27, Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. \n388 (2012) (Nos. 11-713 et al.). Indeed, it has long been \nblackletter \nlaw  that  “the  findings  of  fact  and \nconclusions  of  law  made  by  a  court  granting  a \npreliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the \nmerits.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 \n(1981); see also Community Nutrition Inst. v. Block, \n749 F.2d 50, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Scalia, J.) (noting that \na  court’s  “tentative  assessment  made  to  support  the \nissuance  of  a  preliminary  injunction”  is  “not  a  final \ndetermination” and “is not even law of the case”); 18A \nCharles  Alan  Wright,  et al.,  Federal Practice and \nProcedure  §4445,  at  301  (2d  ed.  2002)  (a  “[g]rant  or",
        "38 \n\ndenial  of  interlocutory  injunctions  clearly  does  not \nforeclose further litigation in the same proceeding, so \nlong  as  [the]  decision  rested  on  mere  preliminary \nestimates  of  the  merits  or  discretionary  remedial \ngrounds”). \n\nthat \n\n“agree[ment]” \n\nGiven  this well-established  rule  and  this Court’s \nunanimous \n“a  preliminary \ninjunction  holds  no  sway  once  fuller  consideration \nyields  rejection  of  the  provisional  order’s  legal  or \nfactual underpinnings,” Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 78 \n(2007),  Texas  was  on  notice  that  there  could  be  no \nassurance  that  the  districts  in  Plan H283  would \nsurvive  a  full  trial.  No  reasonable  legislature  could \nhave  thought  that  the  2012  decision  was  anything \nother than what it proclaimed itself to be: an “interim” \norder,  H.J.S.  App.  301a,  that  indicated  “[n]othing” \nabout the ultimate “merits as to any claim or defense \nin this case,” id. 315a. \n\nThis case shows the wisdom of the principle this \nCourt articulated in Camenisch and Sole: After a full \ntrial,  the  district  court  made  findings  based  on \nevidence  that  was  unavailable  at  the  time  it  ruled \npreliminarily on an interim plan for the 2012 elections. \nFor example, in 2012, the district court did not realize \nthat  the  State  was  emphasizing  SSVR  majorities  in \nNueces  County  because  it  was  possible  to  draw  two \nmajority HCVAP districts. See H.J.S. App. 134a. Nor \nhad it yet had the opportunity to hear from, and judge \nthe credibility, of the legislator from Bell County who \nwas  instrumental  in  splitting  the  city  of  Killeen  to \nfracture a large community of color between two Anglo \ndistricts.  Nor  had  it  heard  from  the  architect  of  the \nchallenged districts in western Dallas County, whose",
        "39 \n\nexplanations the court found to be “superficial” and “in \nbad faith.” See id. 171a-72a. \n\n3.  If  anything,  the  district  court’s  2012  remedial \norder actually was an early indicator that Plan H283 \nwas tainted by purposeful racial discrimination. This \nCourt has long recognized “the well-settled evidentiary \nprinciple”  that  “a  finding  of  illicit  intent  as  to  a \nmeaningful  portion  of  the  item  under  consideration \nhas  substantial  probative  value  on  the  question  of \nillicit intent as to the remainder.” Keyes v. Denver Sch. \nDist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 207-08 (1973) (citing 2 John \nHenry  Wigmore,  A  Treatise  on  the  Anglo-American \nSystem of Evidence in Trials at Common Law 301-02 \n(3d  ed.  1940)). The  fact  that  even  on  a  preliminary \nrecord  the  district  court  had  found  it  necessary  to \n“reconfigure[],”  “restore[],”and  “retract”  portions  of \nPlan  H258,  H.J.S.  App.  307a,  314a,  made \nit \nunreasonable  for  Texas  to  view  the  district  court’s \ninterim  order  as  an  imprimatur  on  the  remainder  of \nits districts. \n\n4.  Because  most  of  the  challenged  districts’ \nboundaries in (legislatively drawn) Plan H283 in 2011 \nand  their  boundaries  in  (legislatively  drawn)  Plan \nH358  in  2013  were  identical,  the  district  court’s \nexpressly provisional acquiescence for the State to use \nthose boundaries in 2012 does nothing to vitiate their \nstatus as purely legislative plans. So even if this Court \nwere  to  agree  with  the  United  States’s  proposal  to \ncreate a “heightened” presumption of constitutionality",

As  this  Court  long  ago \nexplained,  when  a  statutory  provision  is  replaced  by \none \nthen \n“almost \n“[n]otwithstanding” any “formal repeal,” it is “entirely \ncorrect to say that the new act should be construed as \na  continuation  of  the  old.”  Bear  Lake  &  River \nWaterworks & Irrigation Co. v.

U.S. Br. 25 (citing Hunt v. \nCromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549 (1999)). And as an issue \nof fact, it is one where the district court’s resolution is \nentitled to great weight. \n\nHere,  the  district  court  heard  Texas’s  witnesses, \nfound  their  proffered  explanations  pretextual,  and \nultimately  rejected  Texas’s  explanation  on  factual \ngrounds.  See H.J.S.  App.  345a-46a,  348a,  353a-59a; \nsupra  pages  18-23.

That  is  because  the \nquestion  whether  a  state’s  apportionment  plan  was \nadopted  or  maintained  for  a  racially  discriminatory \npurpose  is  a  question  of  fact  to  be  reviewed  under \nRule 52(a)’s  deferential  clear-error  standard.  See \nRogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 622-23 (1982); see also \nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 \n(1985)  (“a  finding  of  intentional  discrimination  is  a",
        "42 \n\nfinding of fact”). So too is the question whether racial \nconsiderations predominated in a state’s redistricting \ndecisions. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1465. \n\nIn fact-intensive redistricting litigation, a district \ncourt’s  assessment  requires  “particular  familiarity \nindigenous  political  reality”  and  “‘an \nwith  the \nintensely local appraisal of the design and impact’ of \nthe  contested  electoral  mechanisms.”  Thornburg v. \nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 79 (1986) (first quoting Rogers, \n458 U.S. at 622, and then quoting White v. Regester, \n412 U.S. 755, 769-70 (1973)). Still greater deference is \nrequired when those findings turn on the credibility of \ncompeting  witnesses.  This  Court  “give[s]  singular \ndeference  to  a  trial  court’s  judgments  about  the \ncredibility of witnesses” because “the various cues that \n‘bear so heavily on the listener’s understanding of and \nbelief  in  what  is  said’  are  lost  on  an  appellate  court \nlater  sifting  through  a  paper  record.” Cooper,  137  S. \nCt. at 1474 (quoting Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575). The \ndistrict  court  lived  with  this  case  for  many  years, \nthrough several trials at which it observed numerous \nwitnesses. Its findings cannot be ignored, much as the \nState would like this Court to do so. \n\nUnder  Rule  52(a),  a  reviewing  court  may  not \nreverse  the  factfinder  merely  because  it  “would  have \ndecided  the  case  differently.” Anderson,  470  U.S.  at \n573. And “[w]here there are two permissible views of \nthe  evidence,  the  factfinder’s  choice  between  them” \nmust control. Id. at 574; accord Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at \n1465 (“A finding that is ‘plausible’ in light of the full \nrecord—even  if  another  is  equally  or  more  so—must \ngovern.”). Rule 52(a) thus guarantees that the merits \ntrial  remains  the  “main  event”  rather  than  merely  a",
        "43 \n\n“tryout on the road” to appellate review. Anderson, 470 \nU.S. at 575 (citation omitted). \n\n2. In the joint trial on the 2013 congressional and \nstate  house  plans  conducted  during  the  summer  of \n2017, the district court heard extensive testimony with \nrespect  to  the  legislative  process  in  2013—evidence \nthat provided direct support for its conclusion that the \nLegislature  acted  with  a  discriminatory  motive.  The \ndistrict  court  properly  relied  on  the  guidance  this \nCourt provided in Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 264-\n68, for inquiring into legislative intent. See H.J.S. App. \n340a. \n\nThe  district  court  found that  the  Legislature  did \nnot  actually  believe  that  “passing  the  interim  maps \nwould  end  the  litigation.”  H.J.S.  App.  358  n.45.  It \npointed  out  that  legislative  leaders  had  made  self-\ncontradictory  statements  about  the  rationale  for  the \nreenactment  and  that  the  Legislature’s  own  legal \nadvisor  had  explained  to  legislators  that  reenacting \nthe maps was unlikely to resolve the litigation. Id.  \n\nAdditionally, the court found that the Legislature \n“pushed the [2013] redistricting bills through quickly” \nwith  no  real  discussion  of  district  configurations. \nH.J.S. App. 354a. It further found that “‘[t]his hurried \npace, of course, strongly suggests an attempt to avoid \nin-depth  scrutiny.’”  C.J.S.  App.  304a  (quoting  N.C. \nState Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d \n204, 228 (4th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1399 \n(2017)).  Finally,  the  court  found  that  the  purported \nlegislative  findings  regarding  the  2013  plan  were  in \nfact  produced  ahead  of  time  by  the  Texas  Attorney \nGeneral to provide cover for the Legislature’s retention \nof the existing districts. H.J.S. App. 355a n.41.",
        "44 \n\nOne  of  the  primary  concerns  of  incumbents  in \nNueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  was  to  check  the \ngrowing power of minority communities that could get \nthem “unelected,” M.D.A. App. 279a; see supra pages \n4-7,  10-11.  That  incentive  to  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength remained just as powerful in 2013 as it had \nbeen  two  years  before.  And  as  this  Court  recognized \nwith respect to Texas’s last round of reapportionment, \nshoring  up  an  incumbent’s  district  in  the  face  of \n“diminishing  electoral  support”  from  a  growing \nminority  community  “bears  the  mark  of  intentional \ndiscrimination  that  could  give  rise  to  an  equal \nprotection  violation.” LULAC v. Perry,  548  U.S.  399, \n440 (2006). \n\nGiven all this evidence, the district court did not \nerr  in  its  ultimate  finding  of  fact:  that  the  2013 \nLegislature’s  intent  was  to  preserve  the  districts  the \nLegislature  had  drawn  in  2011  that  had  not  already \nbeen struck down by the district court.  \n\n3.  Texas  is  simply  wrong  to  argue  that  any \nconsideration  of  the  intent  behind  Plan  H283  is \nsomehow  a  “once-bitten-forever-damned  mentality,” \nTexas  Br.  34.  Leaving  aside  that  this  case  hardly \ninvolves  “once”  and  “forever,”  this  Court  has \nconsistently  declared \ncourts  adjudicating \nthat \nintentional  discrimination  claims  can  look  at  the \nhistorical evidence. \n\nWhen  a  provision’s  “original  enactment  was \nmotivated by a desire to discriminate . . . on account of \nrace,”  and  it  “continues  to  this  day”  to  have  a \ndiscriminatory  effect,  then  the  provision  “violates \nequal protection under Arlington Heights.” Hunter v. \nUnderwood, 471 U.S. 222, 233 (1985). Evidence of past \ndiscrimination,  as  this  Court  explained  in Rogers v.",
        "45 \n\nLodge,  “is  relevant  to  drawing  an  inference  of \npurposeful  discrimination,  particularly \nin  cases” \nwhere  prior  purposefully  discriminatory  enactments \nare  “replaced  by  laws  and  practices  which,  though \nneutral  on  their  face,  served  to  maintain  the  status \nquo.”  458  U.S.  at  625.  In  particular,  the  fact  that \n“[s]ome  of \nthe  more  blatantly  discriminatory \n[provisions in a law]” have already been “struck down \nby the courts” in no way “legitimate[s]” the remaining \nprovisions. Hunter, 471 U.S. at 233. Those principles \nbear directly on this case. \n\nTexas is not telling the whole truth when it claims \nthat it enacted Plan H358 because it “wanted to bring \nthe  litigation  to  an  end.”  Texas  Br.  2.  The  complete \ntruth  is  that  Texas  wanted  to  bring this  litigation  to \nan  end  in order to keep in place the districts its \nLegislature had drawn in 2011 for discriminatory \nreasons. \n\nIf Texas had wanted to bring this litigation to an \nend correctly, it had two options. First, it could have \ndrawn  a  new  apportionment  plan  that  neither \nintentionally  nor  unintentionally  diluted  minority \nvoting  strength.  Had  it  done  so,  appellees  would  not \nhave  continued  to  challenge  the  districts.  Second, \nTexas  could  have  defended  the  merits  of  its  districts \nand  brought  the  litigation  to  an  end  by  winning  the \ncase.  What  Texas  cannot  do  is  end  the  litigation  by \nleaving the court at halftime and asking the referees \nto declare it the winner. \n\nBy deciding to retain the districts it had drawn in \n2011, Texas retained both the assets and the liabilities \nof  those  districts.  One  of  those  liabilities  is  that  the \nchallenged  districts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas",
        "46 \n\nCounties  were  the  product  of  intentional  efforts  to \ndilute minority voting strength. \n\nThe district court was entitled to infer that when \n“a  substantially  similar  Legislature  with  the  same \nleadership” drew exactly the same districts “only two \nyears  after”  it  first  created  them,  H.J.S.  App. 352a \nn.37, it did so for the same reasons. That inference is \nparticularly  defensible  when  the  reenactment  was \n“pushed . . .  through  quickly,”  id.  354a,  with  no \ndiscussion or debate over concerns raised by minority \nlegislators. \n\nUnder  the  circumstances,  the  district  court  was \npresented  with  only  two  explanations  for  the  repeal-\nand-reenactment  strategy:  The  State  claimed  it  kept \nthe  2011  lines  in  place  in  the  challenged  districts \nbecause it thought that the district court had somehow \nblessed  them  in  2012,  and  that  the  court  would \ntherefore  rule  in  its  favor  on  the  merits;  appellees \nclaimed that the State kept the 2011 lines in place for \nthe  same  reason  it  had  adopted  them—to  dilute \nminority voting strength. The district court’s decision \nto  resolve  this  dispute  against  the  State  is  the \nquintessential  factfinding  entitled  to  deference  from \nthis Court. The United States is wrong to label this an \nimproper  “presumption  of  persistent  discrimination.” \nU.S.  Br.  32.  The  district  court  simply  followed  the \nevidence where it led. \n\nthe \n\nfinding \n\nPut  another  way, \n\nof  past \ndiscrimination  here  shows  that  the  United  States’s \nargument  about  a  “particularly  strong”  presumption \nin favor of Texas’s Plan H358 has gotten things exactly \nbackwards.  As  Justice  Thomas  explained  in  United \nStates v. Fordice,  505  U.S.  717  (1992),  when  a  state \nkeeps  in  place  a  system  originally  adopted  for",
        "47 \n\ndiscriminatory reasons,  that original intent remains \nrelevant  “both  because  the  State  has  created  the \ndispute  through  its  own  prior  unlawful  conduct  and \nbecause  discriminatory  intent  does  tend  to  persist \nthrough time.” Id. at 746-47 (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(citing Keyes, 413 U.S. at 209-10, and Hazelwood Sch. \nDist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 309-10 (1977)). \n\nThe  district  court,  in  considering  evidence  from \n2011 in adjudicating the legality of the 2013 plan, did \nnot commit legal error. Indeed, ignoring that evidence \nwould have been flatly inconsistent with this Court’s \nprecedent. \n\nC.  Plaintiffs  in  intentional  vote  dilution  cases \nneed not prove that it would be possible to draw \nadditional majority-minority districts. \n\nTexas’s final argument with respect to the district \ncourt’s findings of intentional discrimination rests on \nthe premise that “to establish the effects prong of an \nintentional-vote-dilution claim, a plaintiff must prove \nthat there is ‘the possibility of creating more than the \nexisting number of reasonably compact districts with \na  sufficiently  large  minority  population  to  elect \ncandidates  of  [the  minority  group’s]  choice.’”  Texas \nBr. 49 (first quoting LULAC, 548 U.S. at 430, and then \nquoting  Johnson v. De Grandy,  512  U.S.  997,  1008 \n(1994)). \n\nTexas is wrong. Neither of the cases it cites were \nresolved as intentional vote dilution claims. Applying \nthe correct standard for assessing effects with respect \nto  such  claims  under  either  Section  2  or  the \nFourteenth  Amendment,  this  Court  should  reject \nTexas’s  argument  that  there  was  no  “vote-dilutive",
        "48 \n\neffect” in Nueces, Bell, and Dallas Counties, see Texas \nBr. 53-54, 58-59, 60-61. \n\n1.  Requiring  plaintiffs  to  show  the  possibility  of \ncreating  additional  majority-minority  districts  is  an \nartifact  of  a  particular  kind  of  claim:  vote  dilution \nunder  the  “results”  test  of  Section  2.  As  this  Court \nexplained  in  Gingles,  this  requirement  is  essential \nwhen  the  injury  the  plaintiffs  assert  is  the  state’s \nfailure to draw such a district. See 478 U.S. at 49-51. \nBy  definition,  if  such  a  district cannot  be drawn,  the \nstate’s  failure  to  draw  it  cannot  be  the  basis  for \nliability. See id. at 50. \n\nBut  as  this  Court  has  repeatedly  recognized,  an \napportionment  adopted  for  discriminatory  reasons \ncannot  be  upheld  even  if  its  effect  “was,  standing \nalone,  perfectly  legal.”  City of Pleasant Grove v. \nUnited States,  479  U.S.  462,  471  n.11  (1987). To  the \ncontrary,  “[a]n  official  action”  when  “taken  for  the \npurpose of discriminating” on account of race “has no \nlegitimacy  at  all  under  our  Constitution.”  Id. \n(emphasis added) (quoting City of Richmond v. United \nStates,  422  U.S.  358,  378 \n(1975)).  Legislative \napportionments violate the Fourteenth Amendment if \n“‘conceived or operated as purposeful devices to further \nracial discrimination’ by minimizing, cancelling out or \ndiluting the voting strength of racial elements in the \nvoting population.” Rogers, 458 U.S. at 617 (emphasis \nadded) (citation omitted). \n\nTo  be  sure,  absent  discriminatory  purpose,  a \njurisdiction does not violate federal law simply by not \ndrawing  districts  that  would  have  increased  a  small \nminority  group’s  voting  strength.  Bartlett  v. \nStrickland,  556  U.S.  1,  14-20  (2009)  (plurality \nopinion).  But  the  limitation  says  nothing  about",
        "49 \n\ncircumstances like those in the present case, in which \na state has acted with a discriminatory purpose. To the \ncontrary,  Justice  Kennedy’s  plurality  opinion  in \nBartlett expressly stated that the Gingles precondition \nof  showing  that  “the  minority  population  in  the \npotential  election  district  is  greater than 50  percent” \nsimply  “does  not  apply  to  cases  in  which  there  is \nintentional discrimination against a racial minority.” \nId. at 20.  \n\n2.  The  Bartlett plurality’s  reliance  on  Garza v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1990), \nsee Bartlett,  556  U.S.  at  20,  supports  the  following \nproposition:  When  there  has  been  a  showing  of \nintentional  discrimination, \nthe \nFourteenth  Amendment  or  Section  2  is  established \nwhenever the challenged district makes it harder for \nthe  minority  community  to  participate  effectively  in \nthe political process. \n\nliability  under \n\nIn  this  case,  the  district  court  found  that  the \n\nchallenged districts had exactly that effect. \n\nthe \n\nStart  with  Nueces  County.  Because  much  of  the \nLatino population there was deliberately “packed” into \none  district  to  buttress  the  prospects  of  an  Anglo \nlegislator in another district, those Latinos left behind \nin \noverwhelmingly  Anglo  district  were \n“marginalized.”  M.D.A.  App.  102a.  Similarly,  in  Bell \nCounty,  the  Legislature’s  decision  to  split  Killeen \nminimized  the  voting  strength  of  a  multi-minority \ncoalition. H.J.S. App. 19a-22a. And in Dallas County, \nthe  district  court  found  that  the  Legislature  had \n“unnecessarily plac[ed] Latinos in HD103 and HD104 \nwhile  simultaneously  making  HD105  more  Anglo  in \norder to protect the Anglo” incumbent and to minimize \nLatino political power. See id. 172a.",
        "50 \n\nGiven  the  adverse  consequences \n\nfor  those \ncounties’ minority citizens, the district court correctly \nheld that appellees had proved a violation of Section 2 \nand  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  What  the  remedy \nshould be can be determined on remand.14 \n\nIII. The  configuration  of  the  districts  in  Nueces \nCounty violates Section 2’s “results” test. \n\nIn  addition  to  holding  that  the  configuration  of \nHD32  and  HD34  violated  federal  law  because  the \nLegislature’s  adoption  of  those  districts  was  the \nproduct  of  intentional  racial  discrimination,  the \ndistrict  court  held  that  the  configuration  violated \nSection  2’s  “results”  test  “insofar  as  two  compact \nHCVAP-majority opportunity districts could be drawn \nwithin  Nueces  County.”  H.J.S.  App.  85a.  This  Court \nneed  not  address  that  alternative  holding  if,  as \nappellees  have  urged,  it  affirms  the  district  court’s \nfindings  with  regard \nintentional \ndiscrimination-based  claims.  But  if  the  Court  does \nreach that holding, it should affirm. \n\nto  appellees’ \n\nContrary to the State’s assertion, Texas Br. 65, the \ndistrict court did not conclude that it was impossible \nto  draw  two  minority  opportunity  districts  within \nNueces  County.  While  there  was  some  uncertainty \nover how well Latino voters would fare if the Section 2 \nremedy  involved  doing  nothing  beyond  reconfiguring \nthe  two  districts  wholly  within  Nueces  County,  see \nH.J.S. App. 50a, 58a-59a, the court found that a Latino \nvoting population that “continues to climb” would over \n\n14  The  fact  that  the  remedy  for  the  State’s  intentional \ndiscrimination  has  not  yet  been  adjudicated  reinforces  the \nconclusion  that  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  over  the  State’s \npremature appeal. See supra pages 29-34.",
        "51 \n\ntime  give  Latino  voters  “a  significant  advantage  in \nhouse district elections” in both districts; indeed, “they \ncould easily control elections.” Id. 55a, 57a-58a. Thus, \nafter  extensive  discussion,  the  court  explained  that \nwhile  two  such  districts  might  not  offer  “the  best \nconfiguration for minority success,” id. 59a, they would \narguably provide an “opportunity to win elections,” see \nid. 56a (emphasis omitted). \n\nTexas’s claim that the district court “recognized” \nthat  a  second  majority-Latino  district  in  Nueces \nCounty  would  produce  an  “over-representation”  of \nLatino  voters  in  the  county,  Texas  Br.  67  (quoting \nH.J.S.  App.  51a),  rips  a  phrase  out  of  context.  The \ndistrict court’s remark came in the course of pointing \nout,  as  part  of \nits  totality-of-the-circumstances \nanalysis, that making both districts in Nueces County \nmajority-Latino  should  not  undermine  finding  a \nSection 2 violation, given that even with two majority-\nLatino districts in Nueces County, Latinos “statewide \nwould still be under-represented.” H.J.S. App. 51a. \n\nTexas  has  not  challenged  the  district  court’s \nfindings regarding the demographics of past, present, \nand potential districts within Nueces County. Nor has \nit  challenged  the  district  court’s  findings  regarding \nracial  polarization  and  socioeconomic  disparities \naffecting  Latino  political  participation  within  the \ncounty.  Given  that  appellees  have  satisfied  all  the \nGingles  preconditions,  see supra pages  7-8—and  in \nlight  of  the  fact  that  the  district  court  has  not  yet \ndecided whether it will require a remedy that creates \ntwo  majority-Latino  districts  within  Nueces  County, \nH.J.S.  App. 60a-61a—this  Court  should  affirm  the \ndistrict  court’s  ruling  with  respect  to  the  Section  2 \nresults claim against HD32 and HD34.",
        "52 \n\nIV.  HD90 in Tarrant County is an unconstitutional \n\nracial gerrymander. \n\nUnder Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), and its \nprogeny,  an  electoral  district  violates  the  equal \nprotection clause when: “(1) race is the ‘dominant and \ncontrolling’ or ‘predominant’ consideration in deciding \n‘to  place  a  significant  number  of  voters  within  or \nwithout a particular district,” and (2) “the use of race \nis  not  ‘narrowly  tailored  to  serve  a  compelling  state \ninterest.’” Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, \n135  S.  Ct.  1257,  1264  (2015)  (first  quoting Miller v. \nJohnson,  515  U.S.  900,  913,  916  (1995),  and  then \nquoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 902 (1996)). \n\nTexas does not contest the district court’s finding \nthat race was the predominant factor “motivating the \ndecision  of  which  individuals  to  place  within  and \nwithout HD90” when its boundaries were reconfigured \nby  the  Legislature  in  2013,  H.J.S.  App.  77a.  The \nthe  witnesses’ \ndistrict \ntestimony,  deemed  the  explanation  for  the  HD90’s \nboundaries  given  by  the  legislator  and  staff  member \nwho drew it “as naked a confession as there can be to \nmoving  voters  into  and  out  of  districts  purely  on  the \nbasis  of  race.”  Id.  81a.  Thus,  the  district  properly \nsubjected HD90 to strict scrutiny. \n\ncourt,  which  observed \n\nTexas’s sole defense is that the State was entitled \nto  engage  in  this  deliberate  racial  gerrymander  in \norder to comply with a Voting Rights Act mandate to \n“maintain[]  HD90  as  a  majority-Hispanic  district.” \nTexas  Br.  69.  That  defense  is  meritless.  The  2013 \nchanges  made  to  HD90  involved  neither  a  genuine \ncompelling government interest nor narrow tailoring. \nAnd because “HD90 actually was redrawn by the 2013 \nLegislature,”  id.  at  34,  it  undermines  the  State’s",
        "53 \n\nrefrain that in 2013, the State “enacted a House plan \nthat  made  only  minor  changes”  to  the  legislatively \ndrawn  districts  that  had  been  left  intact  under  the \ndistrict court’s 2012 interim remedy, id. at 26. \n\nis  whether \n\nthe  government’s \n\n(1989)—not  whether \n\n1. When strict scrutiny applies, as it does here, the \n“actual \nquestion \npurpose[]”  in  relying  on  a  suspect  classification  is  a \ncompelling one, City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., \n488  U.S.  469,  495 \nthe \ngovernment can proffer an “hypothesized or invented \npost hoc ”  justification  “in  response  to  litigation,” \nUnited States v. Virginia,  518  U.S.  515,  533  (1996). \nHere,  the  district  court  concluded  that  the  real \nmotivation for the 2013 reconfiguration of HD90 had \nnothing  to  do  with  ensuring  compliance  with  the \nVoting Rights Act. H.J.S. App. 81a-83a. As appellees \nhave  already  explained,  see supra pages  41-43,  in \nreviewing  that  factual  finding,  this  Court must  “give \nsingular  deference”  to  the  trial  court’s  credibility \ndeterminations.  Cooper v. Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455, \n1476  (2017).  That  deference  is  warranted  here.  In \naddition,  the  record  more  than  supports  the  district \ncourt’s findings. \n\nTo  begin,  HD90  as  configured  in  2011  was \nmajority-Latino in HCVAP using 2008-2010 ACS data, \nand  majority  SSVR.  M.D.A.  App.  266a.  The  Texas \nAttorney General urged the Legislature to retain that \nconfiguration  as  part  of  the  2013  apportionment \nlegislation. See  H.J.S.  App.  440a.  Thus,  rather  than \nsuggesting that the Voting Rights Act required the use \nof race to redraw HD90’s boundaries, the State’s chief \nthe \nlawyer \nexisting \nretaining \nfollowed  that \nboundaries.  Had  the  Legislature \nadvice—as  it  did  with  respect  to  essentially  all  the \n\nrecommended",
        "54 \n\nother districts that had not been altered by the 2012 \ninterim  remedy—HD90  would  have  remained  a \nmajority Hispanic district with no need to deliberately \nand surgically move voters into and out of the district \nbased on their race. There would have been no Shaw \nclaim. \n\nAs Texas acknowledges, the impetus for the 2013 \nboundary manipulations was the incumbent’s desire to \nrecapture a pocket of non-Latino supporters who had \nnot been included within HD90 under the 2011 plan. \nTexas  Br.  69-70.  It  was  the  discretionary  decision  to \nadd  this  non-Latino  population  to  the  district  that \nnecessitated  removing  other  non-Latino  residents  in \norder to retain the district’s demographic character. \n\nthe  state  house \n\nDiscussion of redrawing HD90 to comply with the \nVoting  Rights  Act  appears  nowhere  in  the  2013 \nlegislative  record.  On \nfloor, \nRepresentative  Burnam,  the  amendment’s  author, \nstated only that the new boundaries for HD90 restored \nthe Como precinct to HD90 and also moved Anglos out \nof  HD90  and  minority  voters  into  HD90. See H.J.S. \nApp.  80a-81a.  At  trial,  Burnam  testified  that  his \nstaffer  did  not  track  election  results  while  making \nchanges  to  HD90  because  “[i]t  was  purely  a \ndemographic  exercise.”  Task  Force  M.D.A.  App.  5a. \nThe  district  court  concluded,  after  reviewing  all  the \nevidence, that “no one considered the legal significance \nof  the  [demographic]  target  in  terms  of  compliance \nwith the VRA.” H.J.S. App. 81a-82a. \n\nIn addition to the dearth of evidence showing that \nTexas considered the impact of its changes on Latino \nvoters’  opportunity  to  elect,  the  sequence  of  district \nconfigurations  belies  the  State’s  claim  that  the \ndeliberate  focus  on  race  was  undertaken  for  Voting",
        "55 \n\nRights Act compliance. In the usual successful defense \nto a Shaw claim, a state shows that the Voting Rights \nAct requires use of race because the elements of a vote \ndilution claim are present. See, e.g., Cooper, 137 S. Ct. \nat  1470  (“If a  state  has  good  reason  to  think  that all \nthe ‘Gingles preconditions’ are met, then so too it has \ngood  reason  to  believe  that  §  2  requires  drawing  a \nmajority-minority  district.”).  Here,  however,  the \nState’s changes to HD90 were not spurred by a desire \nto create  a  Latino  opportunity  district  in  compliance \nwith  the  Voting  Rights  Act.  HD90  was  already a \nmajority-Latino  district  before  Burnam  proposed \nredrawing  it.  That  the  redrawn  district  actually \n“decrease[d]” \nof  Spanish-surnamed \nregistered  voters  in  the  district,  H.J.S.  App.  73a, \nfurther gives the lie to the State’s rationalizations: It \nis difficult to imagine how the Voting Rights Act would \nrequire predominant use of race to lower the electoral \nstrength of Latinos in an existing Latino opportunity \ndistrict.15 \n\nshare \n\nthe \n\n2.  Nor,  under  the  circumstances,  was  the  use  of \nrace  in  modifying  HD90  narrowly  tailored  to  comply \nwith the Voting Rights Act.  \n\nEven if the district court had found that Texas had \na strong basis in evidence to conclude that the Voting \n\n15  The  Court  should  reject  Texas’s  attempt  to  use  an \nexpression  of  concern  about  this  decrease  made  by  MALC’s \ncounsel as evidence that compliance with the Voting Rights Act \nmotivated  the  Legislature’s  reliance  on  race. See Texas  Br.  70. \nThat concern was expressed in the context of an initial proposal \nby Burnam and Kenney to modify HD90 that would have reduced \nthe number of Latino registered voters in HD90. J.A. 399a. That \nconcern would never have needed to be expressed had the State \nmaintained the 2011 configuration of HD90.",
        "56 \n\nRights Act required it to maintain the existing SSVR \nlevel  in  HD90,  the  narrowly  tailored  solution  would \nhave been to refrain from moving a heavily non-Latino \nprecinct  into  HD90  and  then  splitting  ten  other \nprecincts  to  move  voters  into  and  out  of  the  district \nbased on race.  \n\nThe  State’s  race-based  redistricting  of  HD90 \ncannot survive strict scrutiny, regardless whether the \nVoting Rights Act required maintaining the district’s \nexisting  SSVR,  because  it  was  eminently  possible  to \nmeet that target without making predominant use of \nrace. Texas had already met that goal in 2011. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  Court  should \ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction or, alternatively, affirm \nthe order of the district court. \n\nRespectfully submitted,",

Brief for Appellants (“Texas Br.”) 3. \nAs  explained  below,  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  at \nthis time. See infra pages. 29-34. \n\nINTRODUCTION \n\nAppellants (“Texas” or the “State”) and the United \nStates  profoundly  mischaracterize  what  this  case  is \nabout.  They  would  have  this  Court  regard  the  Texas \nHouse  of  Representatives  (“state  house”)  districts  at \nissue here as “court-drawn” or “court imposed,” Texas \nBr. i, 9, 28, 32, 33, 34, 35, 39, 41, 45, 64, or part of a \ncourt’s  “own”  plan,  Brief  for  the  United  States  as \nAppellee  in  Support  of  Appellants  (“U.S. Br.”)  24.  To \nthe contrary: As Texas itself insisted the last time this \ndispute  came  to  the  Court,  these  districts  reflect  the \nState’s “choices”—not any court’s, Br. for Appellants at \n18, Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388 (2012) (Nos. 11-713 et \nal.). \n\nSix  of  the  districts—HD32  and  HD34  in  Nueces \nCounty; HD54 and HD55 in Bell County; and HD104 \nand  HD105  in  Dallas  County—were  drawn  by  the \nTexas  Legislature  in  2011  without  any  judicial \ninvolvement  and  were  reenacted,  without  change,  by \nin  2013.  The  district  court’s \nthe  Legislature \npreliminary decision in 2012 to leave those districts in \n\n \n\f2 \n\nit  drew \n\nplace  when \ninterim  remedial  districts \nelsewhere  in  the  State  did  nothing  to  change  those \ndistricts’  fundamental  character.  A  seventh  district, \nHD103 \nin  Dallas  County,  was  drawn  by  the \nLegislature in 2011 without any judicial involvement, \nwas left unchanged by the district court in 2012, and \nwas  reenacted  in  2013  with  immaterial  changes \nproposed by a legislator, H.J.S. App. 23a. And even the \nState admits that the eighth district at issue, HD90 in \nTarrant County, is of Texas’s own devising. See Texas \nBr. 64, 68.1 \n\nThe  court  below  found  that  both  the  original \nenactment  and  the  reenactment  of  the  districts  at \nissue  here  was \ninfected  by  purposeful  racial \ndiscrimination.  But  the  court  has  not  yet  enjoined \nTexas from using the districts. Texas filed this appeal \nbefore  the  court  could  hold  a  remedial  hearing. \nNothing in 28 U.S.C. § 1253 gives this Court power to \nhear  this  premature  appeal.  But  if  this  Court  does \nreach  the  merits,  it  should  reject  Texas’s  attempt  to \ncement discriminatory districts into place. \n\nSTATEMENT OF THE CASE \n\nBased on a “voluminous record,” J.A. 117a (Order \nDenying  Motion  for  Entry  of  Judgment  under  Rule \n54(b) (Jan. 5, 2017)), the court below issued a series of \nlengthy  opinions  and  orders  setting  forth  detailed \n\n1 “H.J.S.

Perry v. \nPerez,  565  U.S.  388,  390  (2012)  (per  curiam).  That \ngrowth  was  not  evenly  distributed  around  the  State. \nSee M.D.A. App. 2a. Thus, to comply with one person, \none vote, Texas had to redraw the districts from which \nstate  representatives  are  elected. Perry,  565  U.S.  at \n390. \n\nThe district court described the context in which \nthe  Legislature  undertook  the  post-2010  round  of \nredistricting  as  one  “of  strong  racial  tension  and \nheated  debate  about  Latinos,  Spanish-speaking \npeople,  undocumented  immigration  and  sanctuary \ncities, and the contentious voter ID law.” C.J.S. App. \n302a.  In  all  four  counties  relevant  here,  members  of \nracial or ethnic minority groups accounted for most or \nall  of  the  population  growth.  In  Nueces  County,  the \ngrowth  “was  attributable  to  Hispanics,  as  both \nAfrican-American  and  Anglo  population  declined.” \nM.D.A.  App.  91a. In Bell  County,  “more  than  70%  of \nthe  growth”  was  attributable  to  an  increase  in  the \nminority  population. Id.  278a.  In  Dallas  County,  the \nminority population grew by 350,000, while the Anglo \npopulation “decreased by over 198,000.” Id. 222a. And \nin  Tarrant  County,  “almost  89%  of  the  growth  was \nnon-Anglo.” Id. 257a, 266a. \n\nNonetheless,  Republican  legislators  “were  very \nresistant  to  creating  any  new  minority  opportunity \ndistricts.” M.D.A. App. 4a-5a. They worried any such \n\n\f4 \n\ndistricts would likely elect Democrats. Id. As a result, \n“[d]espite  the  massive  minority  population  growth,” \nthe  Legislature  “not  only  failed  to  create  any  new \nminority opportunity districts, it reduced the number \nof  minority  opportunity  districts.”  H.J.S.  App.  191a. \nIts plan, enacted into law as 2011 Tex. Sess. Law Serv. \nch. 1271 (H.B. 150), is known as Plan H283. \n\n2011:  Designing  the  challenged  districts  in \nNueces, Bell and Dallas Counties \n\nThe  configuration  of  each  of  the  challenged \ndistricts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  has \nremained  unchanged  (with  the  exception  of  an \nimmaterial  change  to  one  district  in  Dallas  County) \nsince they were first drawn by the Legislature in Plan \nH283.  The  district  court  made  extensive  findings \nregarding the districts’ configurations, the legislative \nintent  behind \nthe \nconsequences  of  those  configurations  for  the  voting \npower of minority citizens. \n\nconfigurations,  and \n\nthose \n\n1. Nueces County. “In both 2000 and 2010, Nueces \nCounty  was  majority  Hispanic  [in  total]  population \nand  majority  HCVAP  [Hispanic  citizen  voting-age \npopulation].”  M.D.A.  App. 91a.  Under  the  plan  in \neffect  prior to 2011, the county (whose largest city is \nCorpus  Christi)  elected  representatives  from  three \ndistricts—two  located  completely  within  the  county \nand one shared with adjoining counties. Id. 89a-90a. It \nwas  “undisputed  that  Nueces  County  had  two \nbenchmark  Latino  opportunity  districts”  under  the \npre-2011  plan.  H.J.S.  App.  126a.  Although  those \ndistricts  had  previously  elected  Latino  voters’ \ncandidates  of  choice,  they  had  elected  candidates \nopposed  by  a  majority  of  Latino  voters  in  2010. See \nM.D.A. App. 90a-91a. \n\n\f5 \n\nBecause  Nueces  County’s  population  grew \nrelatively slowly between 2000 and 2010 compared to \nthe rest of Texas, it became possible during the 2011 \nredistricting  to  place  the  entire  population  of  the \ncounty  within  two  districts,  rather  than  giving  it  a \nshare of three. M.D.A. App. 89a, 91a. Early in 2010, a \nstaff member of the Texas Legislative Council wrote to \nthe  chief  of  staff  to  the  Speaker  of  the  state  house: \n“Corpus—Two seats only; three R’s. And worse[,] one \nof  the  seats  will  probably  have  to  be  more  Hispanic \nthan the other and probably elect a D.” Id. 92a. With \nrespect  to  the  two  benchmark  districts  that  were \nmajority-Latino,  the  Speaker  mentioned  to  potential \nLatino  candidates  that  “one  of  their  seats  was  not \ngoing to be there for the next session.” Id. 91a-92a. \n\nThe district court found that it would in fact have \nbeen  possible  to  draw  two  majority  HCVAP  districts \nentirely  within  Nueces  County. See H.J.S.  App.  44a \n(pointing to a plan with districts that were 55.2% and \n59.9%  HCVAP).  But  “[r]ather  than  exploring”  this \npossibility,  the  Legislature  instead  “drew  one  safe \ndistrict  for  Hispanics  and  one  safe  district”  for  an \nAnglo  incumbent,  id.  59a.  Along  the  way,  the \nmapdrawers  justified  their  refusal  to  draw  a  second \nLatino  opportunity  district  by  invoking  a  different \nmeasure  of  Hispanic  population  “because \n[that \nmeasure]  was  lower  [than  HCVAP]  (and  lower  than \n50%),” id.  at  134a  (emphasis  added),  thus  making  it \nseem as if the Latino community could not satisfy the \n\n\f6 \n\nfirst precondition for  creating an opportunity district \nunder Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50 (1986).2 \n\nAs  compared  to  the  number  of  residents  who \nwould  be  included  in  two  ideally  populated  districts, \nNueces  County  was  overpopulated  by  roughly  5000 \npeople. But rather than splitting the excess population \nbetween  the  county’s  districts,  the  Legislature,  with \n“[n]o  explanation”  for  its  decision,  underpopulated \nHD32—the safe Anglo seat—by 563 people, producing \na  district  where  46.3%  of  the  citizens  of  voting  age \nwere Latino. M.D.A. App. 101a. It then overpopulated \nHD34—the majority Latino district—by 5,512 people, \ncreating a district where Latinos constituted 65.9% of \nvoting-age citizens. Id.3 \n\nIn  assessing  why  Texas  had  assigned  so  many \nmore voters to the heavily Latino district, rather than \nallocating  the  overage  more  evenly  between  the  two \ndistricts as an alternative proposal had suggested, the \n“[t]he  only  potential \nthat \ncourt  below \n\nfound \n\n2 The mapdrawers “felt” they could “offset” the retrogression \ncaused  by  eliminating  HD33,  a  benchmark  Latino  opportunity \ndistrict  in  Nueces  County,  “by  creating  a  new  Hispanic \nopportunity  district  in  a  different  part  of  the  State.”  M.D.A. \nApp. 96a. But the two districts in which they increased the Latino \npopulation  provided  no  offset  because  they  were  “already \nperforming for Latinos.” See id.  \n\n3  CVAP  percentages  are  calculated  using  five-year  rolling \nAmerican  Community  Survey  (ACS)  data  from  the  Census \nBureau.  See U.S.  Census  Bureau,  Voting Age Population by \nCitizenship  and  Race  (CVAP),  https://tinyurl.com/CVAPData \n(last  visited  Mar. 19,  2018).  Using  2005-2009  data,  HD32  was \n44.2% HCVAP, and HD34 was 64.6% HCVAP; using 2008-2012 \ndata, both districts’ HCVAP percentages had increased, showing \nthat  Latinos  formed  an  increasing  share  of  Nueces  County’s \npotential electorate. See M.D.A. App. 101a. \n\n                                            \n\f7 \n\nexplanation  given  by  Defendants”  at  trial—“that \nmapdrawers  sought  to  draw  HD34  as  a  district  that \nwould  perform  reliably  for  Latino  voters”—was \n“demonstrably  not  the  reason  for  the  population \ndisparity.” H.J.S. App. 255a n.81. \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nshowed \n\nInstead, \n\nthe \nevidence \nmapdrawers—“including  specifically”  Todd  Hunter, \nan  Anglo  incumbent  from  Nueces  County—drew  the \ndistricts  in  that  county  to  “undermine  Latino  voting \nstrength.”  H.J.S.  App.  136a.  The  “convoluted  line” \nbetween HD32 and HD34, id. 132a (quoting the United \nStates’s  post-trial  brief),  included  ten  split  precincts. \nThis  “indicat[ed]  that  mapdrawers  were  likely  using \nrace to assign population since accurate political data \nis  not  available  below  the  precinct  level.”  Id.  136a. \nThat  “jagged  boundary  line”  included  a  “strategic” \nboot-shaped “extension” that resulted in the safe Anglo \ndistrict’s  capturing  a  Latino  area  that  was  “low-\nperforming”  with  “low  turnout.”  M.D.A.  App.  102a. \nMeanwhile,  the  extension  “removed  [from  the  safe \nAnglo district] two potential Hispanic rivals” who had \nlegislative \nof  whom  was  a \nRepublican.  M.D.A.  App.  102a; see id.  90a.  In  short, \nthe Legislature “intentionally packed Hispanic voters” \ninto a safe Latino district “to minimize their number \nand  influence”  in  Nueces  County’s  other  district. \nH.J.S. App. 136a. \n\nexperience—one \n\nThe  district \n\nthe \ncourt  also \nconfiguration of HD32 and HD34 violated the “results” \n\nfound \n\nthat \n\n\f8 \n\ntest of Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. See H.J.S. \nApp. 44a-61a.4 \n\nAs  already  described,  the  district  court  found  it \nwas possible to draw two majority-Latino districts, see \nH.J.S. App. 44a, thus satisfying the first precondition \nfor a “results” claim under the framework established \nin Gingles, 478 at 50-51. The district court also found \nthe second and third requirements to be met, given the \n“high  levels  of  racially  polarized  voting  in  Nueces \nCounty.”  H.J.S.  App.  48a-49a.  And  turning  to  the \ntotality-of-the-circumstances \nthe  district \ncourt  emphasized  Texas’s  “long  history”  of  voting-\nrelated  discrimination,  including  “intentional  vote \ndilution  in  the  Legislature’s  enactment  of  the  2011 \nplan,”  id.  51a,  and  the  “continuing  pattern  of \ndisadvantage”  suffered  by  Latinos  in  Nueces  County \nthat hindered their ability to participate effectively in \nthe political process, id. 52a-53a. \n\ninquiry, \n\nThe district court expressly left open the question \nof  an  appropriate  remedy.  H.J.S.  App. 61a.  With \nrespect to the Section 2 “results” violation, it pointed \nto  the  potential  tradeoff  this  Court  had  identified  in \nGeorgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 480 (2003), between \nfewer but safer districts on the one hand and more, but \nmore  competitive,  districts  on  the  other.  H.J.S. \nApp. 60a.  It  then  advised  appellees  to  consider \nwhether  they  would  press  their  claim  for  a  second \nopportunity district if the two districts had to be drawn \n\n4  Regardless  of  the  intent  with  which  a  jurisdiction \napportions  its  seats,  an  apportionment  plan  violates  Section 2’s \n“results” test “if, based on the totality of circumstances,” minority \ncitizens  show  that  they  “have  less  opportunity  than  other \nmembers of the electorate to participate in the political process \nand to elect representatives of their choice.” 52 U.S.C. § 10301(b). \n\n                                            \n\f9 \n\nentirely  within  Nueces  County  (rather  than  crossing \ncounty \nlines  to  create  districts  with  a  higher \npercentage  of  HCVAP,  as  appellees  were  seeking  to \nhave the court order). Id. 60a-61a.  \n\n2. Bell County. Killeen, Bell County’s largest city, \nhas  a  diverse,  and  growing,  majority-minority \npopulation.  M.D.A.  283a;  see H.J.S.  App.  181a-82a. \nUnder  the  pre-2011  apportionment,  the  entire  city, \nsave  a  “minuscule,  200-resident  split,”  was  located \nwithin  HD54.  Id.  270a.  The  pre-2011  HD54  also \ncontained  all  of  Burnet  and  Lampasas  Counties. \nM.D.A. App. 277a. \n\nAfter  the  2010  census,  HD54  was  overpopulated \nby nearly 29,000 people. M.D.A. App. 278a. “Minority \npopulation growth [had] accounted for more than 70% \nof  the  growth  in  Bell  and  Lampasas  Counties”  since \n2000. Id. Because Bell and Burnet Counties were now \ntoo  populous  to  share  a  district,  Plan  H283  removed \nBurnet  County  and  its  42,000  residents  from  HD54. \nId.; H.J.S. App. 270a. \n\nTo  make  up  for  the  removed  population,  the \nLegislature  needed  to  add  13,000  people  to  HD54. \nH.J.S. App. 270a. Minority members of the Legislature \nintroduced plans “that would have kept [Killeen] more \nwhole” than did Plan H283, “but they were rejected.” \nId. 19a. “[I]nstead of adding voters to the existing core \nof  HD54,  which  already  contained  almost  the  entire \nCity  of  Killeen,”  id. 179a,  the  Legislature  “removed \nmore population from HD54”—splitting off more than \n30,000  Killeen  residents,  “about  two-thirds  of  whom \nwere  minorities,”  and  assigning  them  to  “already \nheavily Anglo HD55.” Id. 270a-71a. To compensate for \nthat  change,  legislators  moved  “47,000  mostly  Anglo \npersons  [in]  southwest  Bell  County”  from  HD55  to \n\n\f10 \n\nHD54. Id. 270a. The upshot was that voters of color in \nKilleen found themselves split between two majority-\nAnglo CVAP districts (HD54 and HD55). See id. 183a. \n\nThe primary architect of the lines in Bell County \nwas  HD54  incumbent  Representative  Jimmie  Don \nAycock,  an  Anglo. See M.D.A.  App.  277a-78a.  In  his \ntestimony  at  the  2014  trial,  Aycock  claimed  that  the \nlines were the result of a political compromise with the \nincumbent  in  HD55,  who  was  also  an  Anglo. See id. \n278a.  He  also  attempted  to  explain  why  the \nLegislature had rejected alternative plans that would \nhave kept Killeen together in one district. See H.J.S. \nApp.  182-83a.  For  example,  he  objected  to  one  such \nplan (Plan H201) “because it had a ‘land bridge.’” Id. \nThe court found this objection “pretextual” in light of \nthe fact that Aycock  had voted for Plan H283, which \nitself  has  land  bridges  elsewhere.  Id.  Aycock  also \nadmitted  that  he  tried  to  avoid  creating  a  majority-\nminority  coalition  district  because  it  “would  have \nprobably got me unelected.” M.D.A. App. 279a. \n\nthe \n\ncourt \n\nUltimately, \n\nrejected  Aycock’s \nexplanations  for  splitting  Killeen  as  “not  credible,” \nM.D.A.  App.  283a,  as  well  as  “unconvincing  and \npretextual,”  H.J.S.  App.  19a.  It  found  that  “the \ndecision to split Killeen and the minority community \nwithin it (removing minorities from HD54 and moving \nin  Anglos)  was  to  ensure  that  HD54  and  HD55 \nremained  Anglo-majority  and  to  make  HD54  less \nlikely to perform for minority voters.” Id. Accordingly, \nthe  court  concluded  that  in  adopting  Plan  H283,  the \nLegislature  engaged  in  “intentional  vote  dilution  in \nBell County.” Id. 183a. \n\nThe court also found that the new configurations \nof  HD54  and  HD55  “exacerbated  the  existing \n\n\f11 \n\npopulation  deviations”  between  the  districts.  H.J.S. \nApp.  271a.  And  the  State  offered  no  legitimate \nexplanation for doing so. See id. Rather, the deviations \nwere  “exceedingly  political  and  racial”:  Legislators \n“intentionally  used  race \nin  a  way  that  would \noverwhelm the remaining Latino voters of HD54 with \nthe new influx of Anglo voters while also stranding a \nlarge portion of Killeen’s minority voters in the already \nheavily  Anglo  HD55,”  diluting \nthe  minority \ncommunity’s  potential  political  strength.  Id.  The \npopulation  deviations  were  thus  another  way  the \nLegislature  illegitimately  reduced  minority  political \nstrength. See id. \n\n3.  Dallas  County.  Although \n\nthe  minority \npopulation in Dallas County had increased by almost \n350,000  in  the  decade  from  2000  to  2010,  its  Anglo \npopulation had decreased by almost 200,000, and the \ncounty had “lost population relative to the state as a \nwhole.” M.D.A. App. 222a. As a result, Dallas County \nwas  allocated  fourteen  state  house  seats  rather  than \nthe sixteen it had held under the benchmark plan. Id. \n\nUnder  the  benchmark  plan,  there  had  been  two \nLatino opportunity districts in the county: HD103 and \nHD104. H.J.S. App. 166a-67a. A third district, HD105, \nwas  among  those  “on  track  to  provide  minority \nopportunity.” Id. 166a. In 2008, it came within 19 votes \nof  electing  the  minority-preferred  candidate  to  the \nstate  house,  and  in  seven  of  nine  statewide  elections \nthat year, the minority’s preferred candidate received \na  majority  of  the  vote  within  HD105.  See M.D.A. \nApp. 220a-21a. \n\nAlthough  the  county’s  minority  population  had \nthe  Anglo \nsubstantially \npopulation,  the  Legislature  drew  no  new  minority \n\nincreased \n\nrelative \n\nto \n\n\f12 \n\nopportunity  districts  within  the  county  in  2011. \nM.D.A.  App. 222a.  Instead,  it  rejected  a  number  of \nproposals  that  would  have  created  districts  without \nAnglo  majorities.  See id.  237a-40a.  And  it  redrew \nHD105 to ensure that the district would not perform \nfor minorities. See H.J.S. App. 170a. As a result, under \nPlan  H283,  Anglos  controlled  nearly  60%  of  Dallas \nCounty’s  house  seats  with  only  one-third  of  its \npopulation. Id. 166a. \n\nWith  respect  to  the  northeastern  part  of  the \ncounty, the district court found insufficient proof that \nthe  Legislature  had  acted  for  racially  discriminatory \n(rather than partisan) reasons. H.J.S. App. 169a-70a. \nBut  the  court  concluded  that  in  western  Dallas \nCounty,  the  district  lines  for  HD103,  HD104,  and \nHD105  were  drawn  “in  a  racially  discriminatory \nmanner  to \nintentionally  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength.” Id. 170a. \n\nthis \n\nThe  district  court  based \n\nfinding  on \nconsiderable evidence. First, HD103 and HD104—the \ncounty’s  only  majority-Latino  opportunity  districts \nunder Plan H283—were two of the most overpopulated \ndistricts  in  the  county.  M.D.A.  App. 43a;  H.J.S. \nApp. 261a.  Ryan  Downton,  who  assisted \nthe \nLegislature in drawing the districts in Dallas County, \ndid not address Representative Anchia’s objection that \nhis district (HD103) was unnecessarily overpopulated, \nand  Downton  did  not  confer  with  Representative \nAlonzo of HD104 at all. H.J.S. App. 170a, 263a. \n\nSecond, the “bizarre configuration” of district lines \nfor all three districts, M.D.A. App. 244a-45a; see also \nJ.A. 454-58, suggested that minorities had been taken \nfrom  HD105  and  packed  into  HD103  and  HD104. \nHD103 and HD104 had two of the lowest perimeter-to-\n\n\f13 \n\narea compactness scores in the 2011 plan. M.D.A. App. \n244a. HD105’s design was also “a drastic change from \nthe benchmark.” H.J.S. App. 262a. The court noted an \n“HD103 arm” reaching west into HD105, scooping up \nheavily  concentrated  Latino  populations  in  Irving. \nM.D.A.  App. 228a-29a.  It  also  described  a  “jagged, \nbizarrely  shaped”  protrusion  extending  from  HD105 \ninto  HD104,  which  took  “disproportionately  Anglo” \npopulations  from  HD104  and  added  them  to  HD105. \nId.  230a-31a;  see also H.J.S.  App. 262a  (describing \nHD105’s protrusion into HD104 as “the least Hispanic \nchannel that could have been drawn”). \n\nThird,  the  manner  in  which  the  districts  were \ndrawn  also  defied  traditional,  nonracial  districting \ncriteria. The boundary of HD105, for instance, “breaks \nup  numerous  communities  of  interest,”  dividing  the \ncities of Grand Prairie and Irving. M.D.A. App. 230a. \nThe  district  lines  also  split  a  significant  number  of \nprecincts,  including  ten  in  HD103’s  arm  into  HD105 \nand seven that diverted Latino populations in Grand \nPrairie into HD104. Id. 228a, 241a. Residents of split \nwere \nprecincts \nin \nincluded \n“disproportionately  Hispanic”;  those \nHD105 were “disproportionately Anglo.” Id. 231a. \n\nexcluded \n\nHD105 \n\nfrom \n\nDownton,  the  principal  architect  of  the  Dallas \nCounty districts, admitted at trial that he “drew lines \nand  split  precincts  based  on  race  to  put  Anglos  in \nHD105”  and  to  “put  Latinos  in  HD103  and  HD104.” \nM.D.A.  App. 255a.  And  the  fact  that  western  Dallas \nCounty  had  so  many  split  precincts  led  the  Court  to \nconclude that the mapdrawers were relying on race to \nmanipulate  district  lines  and  enhance  the  political \nperformance  of  the  districts  for  Anglos.  H.J.S.  App. \n\n\f14 \n\n171a; see id. 136a (explaining that “accurate political \ndata is not available below the precinct level”).5 \n\nDownton claimed to have packed minority voters \ninto  HD103  and  HD104  to  comply  with  the  Voting \nRights  Act,  but  the  district  court  deemed  Downton’s \nstatement  “not  credible.”  H.J.S.  App. 171a-72a.  The \ncourt  noted  in  particular  that  “there  [was]  no \nindication that any election analysis was done” to see \nwhether  HD103  and  HD104  needed  additional \nminority  population  in  order  to  remain  opportunity \ndistricts. Id.  172a.  In  light  of  the  other  evidence,  the \ncourt  determined  that  Downton’s  reliance  on  the \nVoting Rights Act was “superficial” and “in bad faith.” \nId.  171a-72a.  It  found  that  “the  true  motive”  of  the \ndistrict  configurations  “was  to  dilute  Latino  voting \nstrength  in  west  Dallas  County  by  unnecessarily \nplacing  Latinos  in  HD103  and  HD104”—that  is, \npacking  them  into  those  districts  to  “waste  Latino \nvotes”—“while  simultaneously  making  HD105  more \nAnglo.” Id. 172a. Based on this “compelling” evidence, \nid. 263a,  the  court  ruled  that  HD103,  HD104,  and \nHD105  had  been  intentionally  designed  to  dilute \nLatino voting strength. \n\n2012: The interim remedy  \n\n1. Because Texas was then a jurisdiction covered \nby  the  preclearance  obligation  of  Section  5  of  the \nVoting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10304, Texas could not \nimmediately implement the legislative apportionment \nembodied  in  Plan  H283.  It  sought  preclearance  from \n\n5  As  the  United  States  argued  at  trial,  splitting  precincts \nalso disproportionately depresses voter turnout among minority \nvoters. See U.S.  Proposed  Findings  of  Fact  and  Conclusions  of \nLaw ¶ 119 (Oct. 30, 2014) (ECF No. 1278). \n\n                                            \n\f15 \n\nthe  U.S.  District  Court  for  the  District  of  Columbia. \nSee Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d 133, 138 \n(three-judge  court),  vacated  and \n(D.D.C.  2012) \nremanded on other grounds, 133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013). \n\nAt roughly the same time, a number of plaintiffs—\nincluding appellees here—filed suit in the U.S. District \nCourt  for  the  Western  District  of  Texas  challenging \nPlan H283 on a variety of constitutional and statutory \ngrounds. The district court held off adjudicating their \nclaims,  awaiting  decision  from  the  D.D.C.  on  the \nState’s  preclearance  request.  See H.J.S.  App. 318a. \nWhen  it  became  clear  that  the  D.D.C.  would  not \npreclear  Plan H283  in  time  for  the  beginning  of  the \n2012  election  cycle,  the  district  court  had  to \n“implement[]  an  interim  plan  so  that  the  2012 \nelections  [could]  go  forward.” Id.  302a.  To  meet  that \nobligation, in the fall of 2011 the district court “dr[e]w \nan ‘independent map’ following ‘neutral principles that \nadvance the interest of the collective public good.’” See \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 396 (quoting the district court). That \nmap was known as Plan H302. \n\n2. That independent, court-drawn map no longer \nhas anything to do with this case. Texas immediately \nchallenged  Plan H302.  In  its  appeal  to  this  Court, \nTexas  argued  that  the  district  court  should  instead \nhave deferred, to the maximum extent possible, to the \npolicy  decisions  embodied  in  the  Legislature’s  Plan \nH283. \n\nThis Court agreed. It held that the district court \nhad erred in drawing its own plan. Perry, 565 U.S. at \n392, 396. The Court remanded the case to the district \ncourt  and  ordered  that  court  to  defer  to  “the  State’s \npolicy  judgments”  and  to  “take  guidance  from  the \nfrom \nState’s \n\nrecently  enacted  plan”—that \n\nis, \n\n\f16 \n\nPlan H283—“in drafting an interim plan.” Id. at 393. \nWith  respect  to  Fourteenth  Amendment  or  Section  2 \ninfirmities,  the  district  court  could  depart  from  the \nLegislature’s  Plan  H283  only  where  the  challengers \nhad  demonstrated  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the \nmerits. Id. at 394. \n\n3.  This  Court  issued  its  decision  on  January  20, \n2012, at which point the district court had just over a \nmonth  to  respond  before  the  2012  election  cycle  got \nunderway.  Adhering  to  this  Court’s  directive,  the \ndistrict  court  abandoned  its  independently  drawn \nmap.  After  submissions  from  the  parties,  the  court \nadopted an interim remedy, denominated Plan H309. \nOrder  at  1  (Feb.  28,  2012)  (ECF  No.  682).  The  court \nemphasized that the “interim plan is not a final ruling \non the merits of any claims asserted by the Plaintiffs \nin this case or any of the other cases consolidated with \nthis case.” Id. at 1-2. Three weeks later, on March 19, \n2012,  the  court \nissued  a  twelve-page  opinion \n“explain[ing] that plan.” H.J.S. App. 301a. \n\nEven on the preliminary record then before it, the \ndistrict  court  found  sufficient  evidence  of  racial \ndiscrimination  that  it  needed  to  “substantially”  alter \n21 of the 150 state house districts in Plan H283. H.J.S. \nApp. 314a.6 \n\nHere  are  some  examples  of  districts  the  court \nfound  it  necessary  to  alter:  HD117  in  southwestern \nSan  Antonio  had  “target[ed]  low-turnout  Latino \nprecincts”  to  aid  an  incumbent  who  “wanted  to  get \nmore  Anglo  numbers.”  H.J.S.  App.307a;  see  also \nTexas, 887 F. Supp. 2d at 172 (describing how “Texas \n\n6  It  made  “minimal[]”  alterations  to  an  additional  seven \n\ndistricts. H.J.S. App. 314a. \n\n                                            \n\f17 \n\ntried to draw a district that would look Hispanic, but \nperform  for  Anglos”).  HD149  in  Harris  County  had \nbeen 62% minority CVAP in the benchmark plan. See \nH.J.S.  App.  312a.  But  the  Legislature  “chose  to \ndismantle”  this  diverse,  multiracial  district  that  was \nelecting  the  State’s  “first  and  only  Vietnamese-\nAmerican legislator.” Id. 311a. And in El Paso County, \nthe  district  court  found  that  the  line  drawn  between \nHD77  and  HD78  was  “bizarre,  even  for  a  legislative \ndistrict.” H.J.S. App. 313a. HD77 sported a set of “‘deer \nantler’  protrusions”  designed  to  “grab  predominantly \nLatino  neighborhoods,”  id.,  thereby  protecting  the \nincumbent  in  HD78  who  was  not  the  choice  of  the \nLatino community.  \n\nThe 2012 opinion disposed of nearly all appellees’ \nother claims—including those concerning the districts \nnow before this Court— in a single sentence, reciting \nthat the court had “preliminarily” found no likelihood \nof  success  on  appellees’  remaining  “Section  2  and \nconstitutional  challenges,”  H.J.S.  App.  303a.  With \nrespect  to  Nueces  County,  the  court  offered  an \nadditional one-sentence explanation of why the State \ncould  eliminate  one  of  the  benchmark  Latino \nopportunity  districts:  “Because  Nueces  County  does \nnot  have  a  majority \n[Spanish  surname  voter \nregistration (“SSVR”)] as a whole, the choice to remove \none  district  required  the  elimination  of  one  of  the \nHispanic ability districts.” Id. 308a.7 \n\n7 The district court later explained that the State’s  earlier \n“insist[ence],” H.J.S. App. 134a, on using SSVR—rather than on \nCVAP,  with  respect  to  which  Nueces  County  was  majority \nHispanic—as  the  exclusive  measure  of  potential  Latino  voting \nstrength reinforced the court’s finding of discriminatory purpose. \nSee infra pages 38-39. \n\n                                            \n\f18 \n\nThe  result  of  the  preliminary  ruling  was  that \nevery one of the districts currently at issue in Nueces, \nBell, or Dallas Counties was “left undisturbed from the \nenacted  plan”  and  “configure[d]”  in  an  “identical \nmanner”  to  its  configuration  in  the  Legislature’s \nPlan H283. See H.J.S. App. 303a & n.4 (capitalization \naltered). The only reason these districts needed to be \nincluded in the court’s interim remedial order was that \nbecause  they  had  not  yet  been  precleared,  only  a \nfederal court order could allow them to go into effect. \n\nThe  district  court  took  pains  to  “emphasize  the \npreliminary  and  temporary  nature”  of  its  interim \norder,  stressing  that  “except  for  the  fact  that  PLAN \nH309 sets the districts for the 2012 elections, nothing \nin this opinion reflects this Court’s final determination \nof  any  legal  or  factual  matters.”  H.J.S.  App.  303a, \n314a.  As  the  court  later  explained,  it  had  been  clear \nfrom the outset that its “analysis had been expedited \nand  curtailed”  and  that  its  conclusions  could  “be \nrevised upon full analysis.” Id. 319a. \n\nSix  months  after  the  court  issued  the  order \nadopting  interim  Plan  H309,  the  D.D.C.    held  that \nPlan H283 was retrogressive. Texas, 887 F. Supp. 2d \nat 166. Accordingly, that court did not then resolve the \nquestion  whether  the  plan  was  also  purposefully \ndiscriminatory. But it pointed to “record evidence that \ncause[d]  concern” and “strongly suggest[ed]” that the \nretrogression  “may  not  have  been  accidental.” Id.  at \n177-78. \n\n2013:  Enacting \napportionment \n\nthe  current  state  house \n\n1.  In  2013,  in  the  wake  of  the  decisions  by  the \ncourt below and the D.D.C. and while Texas’s appeal \n\n\f19 \n\nof  the  denial  of  preclearance  was  still  pending,  the \nGovernor called a special session of the Legislature “to \ninterim  map”  as  a \nadopt  the  [district  court’s] \npermanent apportionment. H.J.S App. 5a.  \n\nIt  is  important  to  remember  that  the  “interim \nmap”  involved  two  distinct  classes  of  districts.  First, \nthe  court  below  had  redrawn  28  of  Plan  H283’s \ndistricts,  21  of  them  “substantially,”  in  light  of  its \npreliminary  finding  that  the  existing  configurations \nviolated  federal  law.  H.J.S  App.  313a-14a.  Those \ndistricts—none of which is now before this Court—can \nfairly  be  described  as  court-drawn  or  court-imposed. \nSecond,  the  court  had  left  122  districts  “exactly  the \nsame as those in the enacted plan”—that is, identical \nto the districts the Legislature had drawn in 2011 as \npart of Plan H283. Id. 314a. As to these districts, the \ncourt had simply “defer[red]” to “the legislative choices \nand district lines” made in Plan H283. Id. 356a n.42.8 \n\nThe district court found that the Legislature was \naware that pending challenges to the districts that had \noriginated in Plan H283 and had remained unchanged \nsince 2011 were likely to continue. H.J.S. App. 356a. It \nemphasized  that  “[t]he  Legislature’s  own  attorney, \nJeff Archer, advised them” of this probability. Id.; see \nalso id. 358a & n.45. \n\nThe  district  court \n\nfound  that  the  decision \nnevertheless  to  retain  the  original  configuration  of \nthese  “undisturbed”  districts,  H.J.S.  App.  303a,  “was \nnot an attempt to adopt plans that fully complied with \nthe  VRA  and  the  Constitution”;  rather,  “it  was  a \n\n8 The district court’s findings “concerning the intent of the \n2013  Legislature”  are  laid  out  in  its  order  on  Plan  C235.  See \nH.J.S. App. 6a. \n\n                                            \n\f20 \n\nlitigation  strategy  designed  to  insulate”  the  districts \n“from  further  challenge,  regardless  of  their  legal \ninfirmities.” Id.  355a.  The  Legislature  hoped  that  by \nrepealing the 2011 plan, the State could somehow wipe \nout  the  evidentiary  significance  of  any  findings  of \ndiscriminatory  intent  in  the  initial  design  of  the \ndistricts because it could then argue that that evidence \napplied only to a plan that no longer existed. Id. 357a-\n58a. The Legislature could then immediately reenact \ntime  without \nexactly  the  same  districts—this \ndiscussion or debate or consideration of alternatives—\nand then argue that the silence provided no evidence \nto support a claim that the districts had been drawn \nfor discriminatory reasons. This would enable Texas to \n“maintain the benefit of [the prior] discrimination.” Id. \n358a.  The  district  court \nthis  strategy \nfound \n“discriminatory at its heart.” Id. 359a. \n\nPursuing  this  repeal-and-reenact  strategy,  the \nLegislature  “pushed  the  [2013]  redistricting  bills \nthrough  quickly.”  H.J.S.  App.  354a.  There  was  no \n“deliberative  process  to  ensure  that  the  2013  plans \ncured  any  taint  from  the  2011  plans.”  Id.  353a. \nInstead,  “the  Legislature  continued  its  steadfast \nrefusal”  to  consider  creating  additional  minority \nopportunity  districts,  id.,  rejecting  out  of  hand \namendments proposed by Latino legislators, see, e.g., \nid.  61a-62; Trial Tr. at  281  (July 14,  2017)  (ECF  No. \n1546). But the Legislature did agree to an amendment \nproposed by an Anglo legislator that redrew one of the \nchallenged  districts  in  a  way  that  introduced  new \nconstitutional infirmities. See infra pages 23-25. \n\nIn  contrast  to  the  bill  enacting  districts  for  the \nU.S.  House  of  Representatives,  which  expressly \n“ratified and adopted” the “interim redistricting plan” \n\n\f21 \n\nthat had been “ordered” by the district court, Texas Br. \nStat.  App.  34a-35a,  the  bill  enacting  the  new  state \nhouse  districts  made  no  mention  of  the  2012 \npreliminary  order.  It  simply  listed  the  census  tracts \ncontained within each district. See id. 1a-32a. \n\nThe Legislature’s 2013 apportionment is known as \nPlan H358.  The  district  court  described  the  plan  as \n“heavily  derived  from  the  2011  plans.”  Order  at  13 \n(Sept. 6,  2013)  (ECF  No. 886).  With  respect  to  the \ndistricts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  now \nbefore this Court, that is an understatement. Six are \nidentical  to  the  districts  initially  drawn  by  the \nlegislature  in  2011:  HD32  and  HD  34  in  Nueces \nCounty; HD54 and HD55 in Bell County; and HD104 \nand  HD105  in  Dallas  County.  A  seventh,  HD103  in \nDallas  County,  was  changed  only  slightly  through  a \npopulation  swap  with  HD115.  H.J.S.  App.  23a.9  The \neighth district, HD90 in Tarrant County, was redrawn \nby the Legislature. Id. 70a. \n\n2.  The  district  court  made  clear  that  its  general \nfindings regarding the purpose behind the enactment \nof  Plan  H358  applied  to  the  districts  at  issue  in \nNueces, Bell, and Dallas Counties. \n\nWith  respect  to  the  Nueces  County  districts,  the \ncourt  acknowledged  that  it  had  “not  alter[ed]  the \ndistricts in [its interim 2012] Plan H309.” H.J.S. App. \n28a.  But  it  explained  that  it  had  then  “lacked  the \nbenefit  of  the  full  record  in  making  its  preliminary \ndeterminations.” Id.  For  example,  in  2012,  the  court \nhad “focused on” SSVR, the State’s proffered measure \nof  Hispanic  population—a  measure  under  which  “it \n\n9 No party has challenged that swap. H.J.S. App. 23a. \n\n                                            \n\f22 \n\nwas mathematically impossible to draw two Hispanic \ndistricts  wholly  within”  Nueces  County. Id. 27a-28a. \nBut a “review of the full record” revealed that the State \nknew  that  under  a  different,  more  commonly  used \nmeasure,  “the  HCVAP  of  Nueces  County  was \ncomfortably  above  50%,”  making  two  Hispanic-\nmajority  districts  possible. Id.  28a  n.19.  And  yet  the \nState “did not look into whether two majority-HCVAP \nLatino opportunity districts could be maintained.” Id. \n27a. \n\nBased on the full record, the court found both that \nthe  Legislature  had  drawn  the  Nueces  County \ndistricts in 2011 for discriminatory purposes and that \nbecause \n“remain[ed] \nunchanged”  in  the  2013  plan,  H.J.S.  App.  30a,  “that \ndiscrimination  was  purposefully  maintained  in  Plan \nH358,” id. 60a. \n\ntainted  district \n\nlines \n\nthe \n\nWith respect to the Bell County districts, the court \nmade a similar finding. There, too, the lines drawn by \nthe Legislature in 2011 were carried forward into Plan \nH358  “unchanged.”  H.J.S.  App.  20a.  The  court  had \nearlier  found  that  in  configuring  the  Bell  County \ndistricts,  Representative  Aycock  had  deliberately \n“divided the growing minority City of Killeen to protect \nhis incumbency.” M.D.A. App. 289a. The district court \nfound that “the 2013 Legislature intended to continue \nthe  intentional  discrimination  found  in  Plan  H283” \nwith  respect  to  the  partition  of  Killeen.  H.J.S.  App.  \n22a.  Thus,  the  racially  discriminatory  “intent  and \nharm remain in Plan H358.” Id. \n\nFinally, the court found that the State’s unlawful \nintent to minimize minority voting strength in western \nDallas  County  remained  unchanged  in  reenacting \nsubstantially  identical  districts  in  Plan  H358.  H.J.S. \n\n\f23 \n\nApp. 26a. HD 105’s configuration had been designed to \nensure  that  Latino  voters,  nearing  the  ability  to \nunseat  a  representative  who  did  not  reflect  their \nvalues,  were  frustrated  in  that  political  effort.  Id. \n167a.  Nothing  in  the  new  plan  “remove[d]  or \nremed[ied] the intentional discrimination” inflicted in \nthat part of the County. Id. 26a. \n\n3. Unlike the other districts now before this Court, \nHD90 in Tarrant County (the home of Fort Worth) was \ngiven  its  current  configuration  in  2013.  H.J.S. \nApp. 70a.  In  2011,  rejecting  a  proposal  by  Anglo \nincumbent Lon Burnham that would have lowered the \nHCVAP of the district to 43.2%, see M.D.A. App. 12a, \n259a-60a, the Legislature had adopted a configuration \nthat was 49.7% HCVAP and 50.1% SSVR, id. 266a.  \n\nIn 2012, Burnam very narrowly defeated a Latino \nopponent  in  the  Democratic  primary.  Voting  was \nracially polarized; Burnam’s Latino opponent received \n70.6%  of  the  Latino  vote  while  Burnam  received  the \nmajority of Anglo and African-American votes. H.J.S. \nApp.  72a.  So  in  2013,  Burnam  sought  to  revamp  the \ndistrict’s  boundaries  to  bring  the  Como  community \nback  into  HD90.  That  community  (which  is  heavily \nnon-Latino)  “had  consistently  and  overwhelmingly \nsupported him” in the past. Id. 83a. At the same time, \nBurnam  strove  to  ensure  that  HD90  remained \nnominally  a  majority-Latino  district  with  respect  to \nSSVR,  id.  73a,  because  the  Chairman  of  the  House \nRedistricting  Committee,  Drew  Darby,  was  “fixated” \non that figure, id. 82a. \n\nTo accomplish both goals, Burnam and his chief of \nstaff,  Conor  Kenney,  made  unabashed  use  of  race. \nBurnam directed Kenney to split precincts and swap \ncensus  blocks  to  add  Latino  population  and  exclude \n\n\f24 \n\nAnglo  population  in  order  to  counterbalance  the \naddition  of  Como.  He  admitted  that  “we  really  made \nsome ugly lines” and “got rid of every white voter near \nthe  western  boundary  of  the  district  to  keep  the \nHispanic  vote  over  50  percent,  but  to  get  Como  back \ninto the district.” H.J.S. App. 73a. Kenney “started by \nswapping  whole  precincts  between  the  districts,  but \nquickly  began  trading  populations  at  the  block  level, \nusing  racial  shading  and \n[Hispanic  voting-age \npopulation] as a proxy for SSVR.” Id. Burnam testified \nthat  concern  about  population  deviations  got  “lost  in \nthe  process”  because  “we  had  to  deal  with  taking  as \nmany white folks out as we could.” Id. 74a. \n\nand  Hispanic \n\nDuring  the  floor  debate  on  the  redistricting  bill, \nBurnam  explained  his  amendment  to  the  other \nlegislators  this  way:  it  would  “take  the  African \nAmerican \nof \nRepresentative Geren’s district and put[] some of my \nAnglo  population  into  his  district.”  H.J.S.  App.  75a. \nChairman Darby then urged the members to approve \nthe amendment, stating that Burnam’s final proposal \n“br[ought] the numbers back over 50%.” Id. 81a. The \namendment passed. \n\npopulation \n\nout \n\nThe district court found that while HD90 did not \nintentionally  dilute  Latino  voting  strength—as  it \nhappened, a Latino challenger defeated Burnam in the \n2014  primary,  H.J.S.  App.  76a—the  district  was  an \nunconstitutional  racial  gerrymander  under \nthe \nstandard laid out by this Court in Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. 630 (1993), and its progeny. See H.J.S. App. 71a-\n84a. The court pointed to the “strong direct evidence” \nin  Burnam  and  Kenney’s  testimony  “explicitly \nacknowledging the use of race in their method” as well \nas Burnam’s testimony “speaking candidly about there \n\n\f25 \n\nbeing ‘too many white people’ in HD90.” Id. 77a. The \ncourt  termed  Burnam’s  floor  statements  about  “as \nnaked  a  confession  as  there  can  be  to  moving  voters \ninto and out of districts purely on the basis of race.” Id. \n81a. \n\nApplying  strict  scrutiny,  the  district  court  ruled \nthat the State’s “use of race in drawing HD90 was not \nnarrowly tailored to achieve a compelling government \ninterest.”  H.J.S.  App.  82a-83a.  The  court  saw  no \nevidence that anyone considered the racial target “in \nterms  of  compliance  with  the  VRA.”  Id.  82a.  In \nparticular,  none  of  the  witnesses  provided  “any \nmeaningful testimony as to the potential significance \nof a 50% SSVR threshold.” Id. Based on this evidence, \nand  its  evaluation  of  the  witnesses’  credibility,  the \ncourt  found  that  the  State’s  invocation  at  trial  of \nVoting  Rights  Act  compliance  to  justify  its  focus  on \nrace lacked a “strong basis in evidence.” Id. 81a. \n\nProceedings below \n\n1.  In  response  to  Plan H358’s  enactment,  a \nnumber of the plaintiffs (appellees here) received leave \nto  amend  their  complaints  (which  had  originally \nchallenged the 2011 legislative apportionment in Plan \nH283). See H.J.S. App. 324a-25a. \n\nOne  set  of  amendments  related  to  appellees’ \nclaims  against  Plan H283:  Because  this  Court’s \ndecision in Shelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 \n(2013),  had  released  Texas \nfrom  preclearance, \nappellees sought relief under Section 3(c) of the Voting \nRights Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10302(c), seeking to reimpose \n\n\f26 \n\na preclearance requirement on the State. H.J.S. App. \n324a.10 \n\nA second set of amendments brought challenges to \nPlan 358 under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act and \nvarious strands of the Fourteenth Amendment. H.J.S. \nApp. 325a. \n\n2.  In  2017,  after  a  lengthy  multipart  trial,  the \ndistrict  court  issued  a  voluminous  set  of  opinions.  It \nupheld many districts that one or another plaintiff had \nchallenged.  See, e.g., H.J.S.  App.  11a-12a,  17a-18a, \n67a-68a,  85a.  But  with  respect  to  the  districts  now \nbefore this Court, the district court found intentional \nthe  Fourteenth \ndiscrimination \nAmendment and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. (It \nalso  found  that  the  Nueces  County  districts  violated \nSection 2’s “results” test.) \n\nviolated \n\nthat \n\nThe district court held that the discrimination had \nto be “remedied.” H.J.S. App. 85a. And it ordered the \nState to tell it whether the Legislature would “take up \nredistricting in an effort to cure these violations and, \nif  so,  when  the  matter  will  be  considered.”  Id.  86a. \nFinally, it laid out a schedule for the court to analyze \nremedial  possibilities  in  the  absence  of  legislative \naction. Id. \n\n3. Instead of responding to the district court, the \nState sought relief from this Court. On September 12, \n\n10  In Shelby County,  this  Court  struck  down  the  coverage \nformula in Section 4(b) of the Act, 52 U.S.C. § 10303(b). See 133 \nS. Ct. at 2631. Section 3(c) of the Act authorizes a court that finds \nconstitutional  violations  to  order  that  a  jurisdiction  seek \npreclearance  of  any  future  changes  to  its  voting  laws  “for  such \nperiod  as  [the  court]  may  deem  appropriate.”  52  U.S.C. \n§ 10302(c). \n\n                                            \n\f27 \n\n2017, this Court granted a stay of the district court’s \norder. Abbott v. Perez, No. 17A245. In January of this \nyear, it set the case for argument, postponing decision \non the question of jurisdiction. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nTexas seeks to preempt, rather than appeal from, \nan  order  granting  or  denying  injunctive  relief.  Its \nappeal  is  thus  premature,  and  this  Court  lacks \njurisdiction to hear it. \n\nBut if this Court concludes otherwise, its task is a \nstraightforward  one.  Texas  and  the  United  States \nstake  their  arguments  on  the  proposition  that  the \nchallenged  districts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas \nCounties are “court-drawn,” “court-imposed,” or part of \na court’s “own plan.” That premise is untrue. Once this \nCourt  recognizes  that  the  challenged  districts  are \nlegislatively drawn, first and last, the argument that \nthis  Court  should  accord  Texas’s  decision  a \n“particularly strong” “presumption of good faith,” U.S. \nBr. 24, collapses. \n\nMoreover,  because  the  districts  in  Nueces,  Bell, \nand  Dallas  Counties  were  crafted  by  the  Texas \nLegislature  in  2011  and  carried  forward  essentially \nunchanged  into  the  current  apportionment  statute, \nthe  district  court  was  correct  to \nlook  at  the \nLegislature’s  intent  in  both  2011  and  2013.  Texas \noffers only perfunctory responses to the district court’s \nfactual  findings  with  respect  to  the  discriminatory \ngenesis of the challenged districts. The district court’s \ndetailed  findings  of  fact,  with  respect  to  both  the \ndiscriminatory  intent  with  which  the  districts  were \ndrawn  in  2011  and  the  discriminatory  intent  with \nwhich  those  district  lines  were  carried  forward  in \n\n\f28 \n\n2013, should be affirmed under the standard set out in \nRule 52(a) of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure and \napplied  consistently  by  this  Court  in  redistricting \ncases. This Court should not permit Texas to launder \nits tainted districts by passing them through a district \ncourt  decision  that  did  nothing  more  than  decline  to \nenter a preliminary injunction against them. \n\nTexas is also wrong to claim that a district drawn \nwith racially discriminatory intent cannot violate the \nFourteenth  Amendment  or  Section  2  of  the  Voting \nRights  Act  unless  plaintiffs  satisfy  the  threshold \nrequirements  for  establishing  a  Section 2  “results” \nclaim.  To  the  contrary:  As  long  as  a  purposefully \ndiscriminatory  apportionment  has  a  discernible \ndiscriminatory effect, it violates the Constitution and \nSection  2  regardless  whether  it  would  be  possible  to \ndraw additional majority-nonwhite districts. And with \nrespect to the Nueces County Section 2 “results” claim, \nTexas’s arguments go only to the question of remedy, \nnot the question of liability.  \n\nFinally, with respect to HD90, the State does not \ncontest  the  district  court’s  finding  that  race  was  the \npredominant motive for how the lines were drawn in \n2013.  Nor  could  it.  It  claims  only  that  the  district \nsurvives strict scrutiny because the Legislature had a \n“strong basis” for considering race in order to comply \nwith Section 2. Texas Br. 68. The district court rejected \nthat  claim  because  it  found  “no  evidence  that  any \nlegislator  or  staffer”  considered  the  “effect  on  Latino \nvoting  ability  in  HD90”  when  drawing  the  district’s \nboundaries.  H.J.S.  App.  81a-82a.  Thus,  as  with  the \ndistricts in the other three counties, the State simply \nrepeats its version of the facts, completely ignoring the \n\n\f29 \n\ndistrict  court’s  contrary  factual  findings  and  the \napplicable standard of review in this Court. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  The Court should dismiss this appeal for lack of \n\njurisdiction. \n\nThe time it takes to litigate redistricting cases is \nfrustrating  to  everyone,  appellees  most  of  all.  Under \nthe best-case scenario, a majority of the elections this \ndecade will have been held under a plan that violates \nthe Constitution and the Voting Rights Act. But that \ndevastating  fact  cannot  confer  jurisdiction  on  this \nCourt to hear Texas’s appeal. If this Court were to buy \nTexas’s jurisdictional argument, the upshot would be \nmany more cases in which justice is delayed. \n\n1. Texas blows by the plain language of 28 U.S.C. \n§ 1253,  which  gives  this  Court  jurisdiction  to  hear \nappeals  from  three-judge  district  courts  only  with \nrespect  to  “order[s]  granting  or  denying . . .  an \ninterlocutory  or  permanent  injunction.”  Section  1253 \ndoes  not  give  this  Court  appellate  jurisdiction  over \nother sorts of orders, no matter how important those \norders  might  be  to  the  parties.  This  is  so  even  with \nrespect  to  orders  that  conclusively  determine  the \nunconstitutionality of a statute, Gunn v. Univ. Comm. \nto End the War in Viet Nam,  399  U.S.  383,  388-91 \n(1970), or grant declaratory relief, White v. Regester, \n412 U.S. 755, 760-61 (1973); Mitchell v. Donovan, 398 \nU.S.  427,  430-31  (1970)  (per  curiam).  Thus,  in \nGoldstein v. Cox,  396  U.S.  471  (1970),  the  Court \nemphasized  “that  its  jurisdiction  under  the  Three-\nJudge Court Act is to be narrowly construed” because \n“this  Court  above  all  others  must  limit  its  review  of \ninterlocutory orders.” Id. at 478. \n\n\f30 \n\n2. Ignoring that directive, the United States and \nTexas  seek  to  borrow  a  construction  of  28  U.S.C. \n§ 1292(a)(1)—the  jurisdictional  statute  applicable  to \nthe  courts  of  appeals—that  permits  those  courts  to \nentertain  interlocutory  appeals  beyond  the  “limited \nexception to the final-judgment rule” provided by the \nsection itself, Carson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, \n84  (1981).  In  exceptional  circumstances,  a  party  can \nappeal even absent the grant or denial of an injunction \nif a district court’s order has the “practical effect” of an \ninjunction. See Texas Br. 19 (quoting Carson, 450 U.S. \nat 83); see also U.S. Br. 20. \n\nNeither Texas nor the United States cites a single \ncase  in  which  this  Court  has  adopted  that  loose \nconstruction with respect to Section 1253. Indeed, such \na  relaxation  would  directly  contravene  this  Court’s \ndeclaration in Goldstein. \n\nIn fact, this Court has squarely refused to create a \n“practical  effect”  exception  to  Section  1253’s  textual \nlimitation. In Gunn, for example, a three-judge court \nstruck down a provision of the Texas Penal Code. 399 \nU.S. at 384-86. Like the district court below, the court \nin Gunn  gave  the  state  legislature  an  opportunity  to \ncure the defect rather than immediately enjoining the \nprovision. Id. at 386. Under the theory the State has \npressed  here,  one  would  expect  this  Court  to  have \nentertained  the  appeal  in Gunn because  the  district \ncourt’s legal ruling, together with its suggestion that \nthe  state  remedy  the  defect,  “put[]  the  state  on  the \nclock” to amend its law or face remedial proceedings, \nTexas Br. 23. \n\nBut  this  Court  held  that  it  lacked  jurisdiction. \nThat  was  not  because  the  Court  overlooked  the \npractical effect of the district court’s ruling. The Court \n\n\f31 \n\na \n\ncourt \n\nopinion \n\nholding \n\nrecognized  that  a  state  official  “confronted”  with  a \nfederal \nstatute \nunconstitutional “would no doubt hesitate long before \ndisregarding it.” Gunn, 399 U.S. at 390. Nevertheless, \nthis Court saw “no power” to “deal with the merits of \nth[e] case in any way at all” because no injunction had \nbeen granted or denied. Id. This principle applies with \nequal force in the context of redistricting. In Whitcomb \nv. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971), the Court rejected an \ninitial  appeal  filed  after  the  three-judge  court  ruled \nthat  a  state  legislative  district  was  unconstitutional; \nthe  Court  lacked  jurisdiction  because  “no  injunction \nhad been granted or denied.” Id. at 138 n.19. \n\nTexas  makes  no  effort  to  address  Gunn  or \nWhitcomb.  Instead,  it  tries  to  deflect  attention  by \nclaiming  that  the  order  here  has  “the  exact  same \npractical effect” as the orders underlying this Court’s \nexercise of jurisdiction in Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. \n1455 (2017), and Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161 (U.S.). \nTexas Br. 22. \n\nBut the orders from which the parties appealed in \nthose  two  cases  satisfied  the  textual  requirement  of \nSection  1253.  In  both  cases,  the  district  court  had \nexpressly enjoined state officials from conducting any \nfuture elections under the challenged plan.11 Thus, the \nofficials in those cases, unlike the officials here, were \n\n11  See Whitford v. Gill,  No. 3:15-cv-00421-bbc,  2017  WL \n2623104,  at  *1  (W.D.  Wis.  Feb.  22,  2017)  (three-judge  court) \n(“defendants are enjoined from using the [challenged] districting \nplan . . . in all future elections”); Harris v. McCrory, No. 1:13-cv-\n00949-WO-JEP, at 1 (M.D.N.C. Feb. 5, 2016) (three-judge court) \n(ECF No. 143) (state officials are “enjoined from conducting any \nelections  for  the  office  of  U.S.  Representative  until  a  new \nredistricting plan is in place”). \n\n                                            \n\f32 \n\nsubject  to  “an  extraordinary  writ,  enforceable  by  the \npower of contempt,” Gunn, 399 U.S. at 389. And it was \nabsolutely  clear  that  no  further  elections  would  take \nplace under the challenged plans. \n\nThe United States at least acknowledges the force \nof Gunn and Whitcomb. U.S. Br. 23. And it pointedly \ndoes  not  embrace  Texas’s  expansive  claim  that  any \nfinding  of  liability  combined  with  the  tautological \nobservation  that  there  needs  to  be  a  remedy  once  a \nviolation  is  found  entitles  a  state  to  invoke  Section \n1253.  But  the  United  States  then  suggests  that \nsomehow \n“timing  pressures  present  here” \ntransform  an  otherwise  unappealable  order  into  an \ninjunction.  U.S.  Br.  23.  It  offers  no  explanation  of \nexactly  how  that  transformation  occurs,  or  any \nstandards  to  guide  future  litigants  in  knowing  when \nan  unappealable  order  becomes  appealable.  And  on \nthe  facts,  the  timeframes  in Whitcomb and  this  case \nare  nearly  identical.12  The  Court  should  reject  this \njury-rigged rule. \n\nthe \n\n3.  Adhering to  the  text  of  Section  1253 is not  an \nexercise  in  arid  formalism.  Allowing  premature \nexcessive \nthreatens  unnecessary  and \nappeals \nlitigation. \n\n12 In Whitcomb, the district court issued an opinion in July \n1969, see 403  U.S.  at  131,  for  an  election  cycle  that  was  set  to \nbegin  in  earnest  right  after  the  New  Year,  see Chavis v. \nWhitcomb, 307 F. Supp. 1362, 1366 (S.D. Ind. 1969) (three-judge \ncourt), and ultimately issued a remedy in October, see Whitcomb, \n403  U.S.  at  139.  Here,  the  district  court  issued  its  opinion  in \nAugust 2017 with the next election cycle set to begin shortly after \nthe New Year. Had Texas complied with the district court’s order, \na remedy could have been in place by October. \n\n                                            \n\f33 \n\nsummary \n\nIf Texas is right about when states can invoke this \nCourt’s appellate jurisdiction, then states will be free \nto appeal whenever a three-judge court issues even a \npartial \nin  a  multiparty, \njudgment \nmulticlaim apportionment lawsuit. It is a truism that \nthe  law  must  furnish  a  remedy  for  the  violation  of  a \nright. Marbury v. Madison, 5 U.S. (1 Cranch) 137, 163 \n(1803).  But  that  hardly  transforms  every  declaration \nof a violation into a de facto injunction. \n\nthat \n\nclaim \n\nTexas’s \n\ninterlocutory  appellate \njurisdiction  is  necessary  to  avoid  the  problem  of \n“extremely  expedited”  review,  Texas  Br.  23,  fares  no \nbetter.  That  argument  attempts  to  convert  timing \npressures caused by  this  appeal  into  justifications in \nfavor of  the appeal itself. Rewarding the State’s efforts \nwould produce a dangerous precedent for purposes of \nSection 1253.  Given  that  primary  and  general \nelections  occur  on  a  two-year  cycle  and  taking  into \naccount the calendar on which this Court operates, one \nparty or another will nearly always be able to assert \nthat  an  election  deadline  is impending  and  therefore \njustifies  this  Court’s  immediate  review.  Exigency  is \nwithout  doubt  a  necessary  condition  for  Section \n1292(a)(1)-style review, see Carson, 450 U.S. at 84, but \nit  is  not  a  sufficient  one,  and  it  cannot  overcome  the \nfact  that  nothing  in  the  order  below  operates  as  an \ninjunction. \n\nTexas  strays  even  further  afield  when  it  claims \nthat it should be allowed to appeal in the absence of an \ninjunction  because  this  would  somehow  “even[]  the \nplaying field” between itself and appellees. Texas Br. \n23.  To  be  sure,  if  appellees’  claims  “had  been \ndefinitively  rejected,”  id.,  appellees  could  have \nappealed.  But  that  is  because  their  request  for \n\n\f34 \n\ninjunctive  relief  would  necessarily  have  been  denied, \nbringing  them  squarely  within  the  terms  of  Section \n1253.  As  the  case  stands,  however,  no  one  can \n“definitively”  say  in  what  ways  the  State  might  be \nforced to depart from the district lines its Legislature \ndrew.  Far  from  leveling  the  playing  field,  endorsing \nTexas’s  proffered  “[p]ractical  considerations”  as \njustification for its appeal would unjustifiably tip the \nscales in the State’s favor. \n\nMake no mistake: Allowing states to appeal after \na  liability  finding  but  before  any  injunction  virtually \nguarantees that this Court will see recurrent appeals \nin redistricting cases. This would flout the well-settled \nprinciple  that  “piecemeal  appellate  review  is  not \nfavored,”  particularly  under  Section  1253. Goldstein, \n396  U.S.  at  478.  A  state  will  have  every  incentive  to \nappeal after a finding of liability without waiting to see \nwhether a district court will in fact enjoin an upcoming \nelection and without there being any potential remedy \nin place. If it loses, it will no doubt file a second appeal \nif  the  district  court  rejects  its  proffered  remedy  (if  it \neven  proffers  one).  And  of  course  if  a  district  court \naccepts  the  state’s  proposed  remedy,  or  imposes  its \nown,  disappointed  plaintiffs  will  then  appeal.  The \nconsequence will be more litigation, and more delay in \nresolving redistricting cases. \n\nIn short, the district court has neither granted nor \ndenied injunctive relief of any kind. That alone should \ndispose of this appeal. This Court should reject Texas’s \nefforts to bend Section 1253 into a statute permitting \nappeals  any  time  a  state  objects  to  a  ruling  in  a \nredistricting case. \n\n\f35 \n\nII.  In the alternative, this Court should affirm the \ndistrict  court’s \nthat  Plan  H358 \nfinding \nintentionally dilutes minority voting strength. \n\nIf this Court decides that it has jurisdiction over \nTexas’s  appeal,  then  it  should  accept  the  district \ncourt’s  finding  that  the  Legislature  adopted  and \nmaintained the configurations of the districts at issue \nin  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  for  racially \ndiscriminatory  purposes  and  hold  that  the  districts \nviolate  both  Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  52 \nU.S.C.  § 10301,  and  the  Fourteenth  Amendment. \nTexas’s  and  the  United  States’s  arguments  against \ndoing  so  distort  the  facts,  ignore  the  standard  of \nreview, and misread this Court’s precedents.  \n\nA.  The challenged districts originated in 2011 \nby \nthat  was \nlegislation \ndiscriminatory  motivations  and  not  in  a \ncourt-imposed remedy. \n\ntainted \n\ntainted  by  purposeful \n\n1.  Texas  does  very  little  to  challenge  the  district \ncourt’s  finding  that  the  2011  process  that  produced \nPlan H283  was \nracial \ndiscrimination. (Indeed, Texas implicitly acquiesced in \nthat finding when it abandoned any attempt to defend \nthe  21  districts  the  three-judge  court  “reconfigured,” \nH.J.S.  App.  307a,  after \nits  preliminary  ruling \nregarding  the  districts’  likely  unconstitutionality.) \nAnd the United States actually intervened in this case \nas a plaintiff to assert both that Plan H283 “had been \nin \nadopted  with  racially  discriminatory \nviolation of Section 2 and that Section 3(c) relief was \nwarranted.” U.S. Br. 13. \n\nintent \n\nInstead,  Texas  claims  that  that  finding,  and  the \ndistrict  court’s  detailed  findings  with  respect  to  the \n\n\f36 \n\ndiscriminatory  intent  that  infected  the  creation  of \nindividual  districts,  is  “legally  irrelevant,”  Texas  Br. \n41,  because  in  Plan  H358  the  Legislature  “adopted \nunchanged  districts  that  the  court  itself ordered the \nState to use in 2012,” id. at 24. \n\nthe \n\nthat \n\nchallenged \n\nThe  United  States  at  least  acknowledges  that \nunder this Court’s precedents, the district court could \nproperly “consider[] the ‘historical background of’ and \n‘sequence  of  events  leading  up  to’  enactment  of  the \n2013  redistricting  plans,  including  whether  the  2011 \nLegislature acted with discriminatory intent.” U.S. Br. \n32  n.12  (quoting Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. \nHous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252, 267 (1977)).  But it too \nasserts \ndistricts  were \n“adopted . . . without change from the court’s own 2012 \ninterim plan[].” U.S. Br. 24. Indeed, the United States \ngoes  on  to  propose  that  the  “normal  presumption”  of \nconstitutionality afforded to legislative enactments be \n“heightened  by  the  State’s  acceptance  of  the  judicial \nplan.” Id. at 30. The United States repeatedly invokes \nthat \nstrong,” \npresumption, id. at 24, 32 n.12, 38, 40; see also id. at \n37  (arguing  that  appellees  should  have  to  “adduce \nparticularly  persuasive \nevidence”),  presumably \nbecause it thinks the presumption is indispensable to \nupholding the challenged districts. \n\n“particularly \n\nnewfound, \n\nand \n\nTexas  and  the  United  States  have  gotten  things \nexactly backwards. The district court—at this Court’s \ndirection, see Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 393 (2012) \n(per  curiam)—adopted  the  Legislature’s  plan  with \nregard to these districts; the Legislature did not adopt \nthe court ’s plan. The configurations of the challenged \ndistricts  are  entirely a  product  of  lines  drawn  by  the \nLegislature  in  Plan  H283—as  the  district  court \n\n\f37 \n\nunanimously  recognized.  Order  at  13  (Sept. 6,  2013) \n(ECF No. 886). The most accurate way to characterize \nthe  record  is  to  say  that  the  Legislature  drew  the \ndistricts in 2011 and that the district court permitted \nthose  unprecleared  districts  to  go  into  effect  for  the \n2012  election.  Indeed,  Texas’s  prior  appeal  to  this \nCourt  was  designed  to  achieve  precisely  that  goal. \nHaving  successfully  argued  in  2012  that  the  court \nbelow should be required to implement Texas’s plan to \nthe  maximum  extent  possible,  Texas  should  not  now \nbe  permitted  to  turn  around  and  claim  that  the \nresulting plan was in fact the court’s idea. \n\n2.  In  any  event,  the district  court’s  2012  interim \n\norder could not provide Texas with a safe harbor. \n\nThe  district  court’s  2012  order  was  avowedly \n“preliminary,”  H.J.S.  App.  303a,  314a,  and  explicitly \ndisclaimed  any  “final  determination  of  any  legal  or \nfactual  matters,”  id.  303a.  And  as  Texas  itself \nacknowledged at the time, it is “well established” that \nany  finding  “made  in  connection  with  an  award  of \npreliminary relief is not a final ruling on the merits.” \nReply Br. for Appellants at 27, Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. \n388 (2012) (Nos. 11-713 et al.). Indeed, it has long been \nblackletter \nlaw  that  “the  findings  of  fact  and \nconclusions  of  law  made  by  a  court  granting  a \npreliminary injunction are not binding at trial on the \nmerits.” Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 \n(1981); see also Community Nutrition Inst. v. Block, \n749 F.2d 50, 56 (D.C. Cir. 1984) (Scalia, J.) (noting that \na  court’s  “tentative  assessment  made  to  support  the \nissuance  of  a  preliminary  injunction”  is  “not  a  final \ndetermination” and “is not even law of the case”); 18A \nCharles  Alan  Wright,  et al.,  Federal Practice and \nProcedure  §4445,  at  301  (2d  ed.  2002)  (a  “[g]rant  or \n\n\f38 \n\ndenial  of  interlocutory  injunctions  clearly  does  not \nforeclose further litigation in the same proceeding, so \nlong  as  [the]  decision  rested  on  mere  preliminary \nestimates  of  the  merits  or  discretionary  remedial \ngrounds”). \n\nthat \n\n“agree[ment]” \n\nGiven  this well-established  rule  and  this Court’s \nunanimous \n“a  preliminary \ninjunction  holds  no  sway  once  fuller  consideration \nyields  rejection  of  the  provisional  order’s  legal  or \nfactual underpinnings,” Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 78 \n(2007),  Texas  was  on  notice  that  there  could  be  no \nassurance  that  the  districts  in  Plan H283  would \nsurvive  a  full  trial.  No  reasonable  legislature  could \nhave  thought  that  the  2012  decision  was  anything \nother than what it proclaimed itself to be: an “interim” \norder,  H.J.S.  App.  301a,  that  indicated  “[n]othing” \nabout the ultimate “merits as to any claim or defense \nin this case,” id. 315a. \n\nThis case shows the wisdom of the principle this \nCourt articulated in Camenisch and Sole: After a full \ntrial,  the  district  court  made  findings  based  on \nevidence  that  was  unavailable  at  the  time  it  ruled \npreliminarily on an interim plan for the 2012 elections. \nFor example, in 2012, the district court did not realize \nthat  the  State  was  emphasizing  SSVR  majorities  in \nNueces  County  because  it  was  possible  to  draw  two \nmajority HCVAP districts. See H.J.S. App. 134a. Nor \nhad it yet had the opportunity to hear from, and judge \nthe credibility, of the legislator from Bell County who \nwas  instrumental  in  splitting  the  city  of  Killeen  to \nfracture a large community of color between two Anglo \ndistricts.  Nor  had  it  heard  from  the  architect  of  the \nchallenged districts in western Dallas County, whose \n\n\f39 \n\nexplanations the court found to be “superficial” and “in \nbad faith.” See id. 171a-72a. \n\n3.  If  anything,  the  district  court’s  2012  remedial \norder actually was an early indicator that Plan H283 \nwas tainted by purposeful racial discrimination. This \nCourt has long recognized “the well-settled evidentiary \nprinciple”  that  “a  finding  of  illicit  intent  as  to  a \nmeaningful  portion  of  the  item  under  consideration \nhas  substantial  probative  value  on  the  question  of \nillicit intent as to the remainder.” Keyes v. Denver Sch. \nDist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 207-08 (1973) (citing 2 John \nHenry  Wigmore,  A  Treatise  on  the  Anglo-American \nSystem of Evidence in Trials at Common Law 301-02 \n(3d  ed.  1940)). The  fact  that  even  on  a  preliminary \nrecord  the  district  court  had  found  it  necessary  to \n“reconfigure[],”  “restore[],”and  “retract”  portions  of \nPlan  H258,  H.J.S.  App.  307a,  314a,  made \nit \nunreasonable  for  Texas  to  view  the  district  court’s \ninterim  order  as  an  imprimatur  on  the  remainder  of \nits districts. \n\n4.  Because  most  of  the  challenged  districts’ \nboundaries in (legislatively drawn) Plan H283 in 2011 \nand  their  boundaries  in  (legislatively  drawn)  Plan \nH358  in  2013  were  identical,  the  district  court’s \nexpressly provisional acquiescence for the State to use \nthose boundaries in 2012 does nothing to vitiate their \nstatus as purely legislative plans. So even if this Court \nwere  to  agree  with  the  United  States’s  proposal  to \ncreate a “heightened” presumption of constitutionality \n\n\f40 \n\nwhen a state “accept[s]” a “judicial plan,” U.S. Br. 30, \nthat presumption would have no bearing on this case.13 \n\nis \n\nthat \n\nidentical,” \n\nInstead,  with  respect  to  the  districts  carried \nforward unchanged from Plan H283 to Plan H358, the \n2013 simultaneous repeal and reenactment is nothing \nmore  than  a  legal  fiction.  As  this  Court  long  ago \nexplained,  when  a  statutory  provision  is  replaced  by \none \nthen \n“almost \n“[n]otwithstanding” any “formal repeal,” it is “entirely \ncorrect to say that the new act should be construed as \na  continuation  of  the  old.”  Bear  Lake  &  River \nWaterworks & Irrigation Co. v. Garland,  164 U.S.  1, \n11  (1896); see also Oneida County v. Oneida Indian \nNation of N.Y. State, 470 U.S. 226, 246 n.18 (1985); 73 \nAm. Jur. 2d Statutes § 271 (West 2018); see also Ne. \nFla. Chapter of the Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. \nv. City of Jacksonville,  508  U.S.  656,  661-62  (1993) \n(treating  an  ordinance  that  was  repealed  and \nessentially reenacted as being continuously in effect). \n\nB.    The  Legislature’s  2013  reenactment  of  the \nchallenged  districts  was  purposefully \ndiscriminatory. \n\nPlan H358 was drawn by “a substantially similar \nLegislature  with  the  same  leadership  only  two  years \nafter  the  original  enactment”  of  Plan H285.  H.J.S. \nApp. 352a n.37. Texas argued before the district court \nthat  the  reason  it  preserved  the  challenged  districts \nunchanged  (save  for  an  immaterial  modification  of \nHD105)  was  that  it  believed  that  those  districts  had \n\n13 The State did not just “accept” the interim plan; it changed \na district (HD90 in Tarrant County) in ways that introduced new \nconstitutional infirmities. See supra pages 23-25. \n\n                                            \n\f41 \n\nbeen approved by the district court and that retaining \nthem would “avoid protracted litigation,” Texas Br. 1.  \n\nTexas’s reason for reenacting the districts, like all \n“determination[s]  of  a  legislature’s  motivation,”  is \n“ultimately  an  issue  of  fact,”  as  the  United  States \nforthrightly acknowledges. U.S. Br. 25 (citing Hunt v. \nCromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 549 (1999)). And as an issue \nof fact, it is one where the district court’s resolution is \nentitled to great weight. \n\nHere,  the  district  court  heard  Texas’s  witnesses, \nfound  their  proffered  explanations  pretextual,  and \nultimately  rejected  Texas’s  explanation  on  factual \ngrounds.  See H.J.S.  App.  345a-46a,  348a,  353a-59a; \nsupra  pages  18-23.  Instead,  the  district  court  found \nthat the State stuck with its original districts because \nit “intended” to “maintain[]” the discriminatory “taint” \nthat had originally motivated the districts while being \n“safe  from  remedy”  through  the  ruse  of  repeal-and-\nreenact. H.J.S. App. 359a. \n\n1. The district court’s findings of fact with respect \nto the Legislature’s intent in both 2011 and 2013 are \nentitled to significant deference. Last Term, this Court \nreiterated its longstanding recognition that a district \ncourt’s  “assessment”  of  the  purposes  behind  a \nlegislative  apportionment  plan  “warrants  significant \ndeference on appeal to this Court.” Cooper v. Harris, \n137  S.  Ct.  1455,  1464  (2017).  That  is  because  the \nquestion  whether  a  state’s  apportionment  plan  was \nadopted  or  maintained  for  a  racially  discriminatory \npurpose  is  a  question  of  fact  to  be  reviewed  under \nRule 52(a)’s  deferential  clear-error  standard.  See \nRogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 622-23 (1982); see also \nAnderson v. City of Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 573 \n(1985)  (“a  finding  of  intentional  discrimination  is  a \n\n\f42 \n\nfinding of fact”). So too is the question whether racial \nconsiderations predominated in a state’s redistricting \ndecisions. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1465. \n\nIn fact-intensive redistricting litigation, a district \ncourt’s  assessment  requires  “particular  familiarity \nindigenous  political  reality”  and  “‘an \nwith  the \nintensely local appraisal of the design and impact’ of \nthe  contested  electoral  mechanisms.”  Thornburg v. \nGingles, 478 U.S. 30, 79 (1986) (first quoting Rogers, \n458 U.S. at 622, and then quoting White v. Regester, \n412 U.S. 755, 769-70 (1973)). Still greater deference is \nrequired when those findings turn on the credibility of \ncompeting  witnesses.  This  Court  “give[s]  singular \ndeference  to  a  trial  court’s  judgments  about  the \ncredibility of witnesses” because “the various cues that \n‘bear so heavily on the listener’s understanding of and \nbelief  in  what  is  said’  are  lost  on  an  appellate  court \nlater  sifting  through  a  paper  record.” Cooper,  137  S. \nCt. at 1474 (quoting Anderson, 470 U.S. at 575). The \ndistrict  court  lived  with  this  case  for  many  years, \nthrough several trials at which it observed numerous \nwitnesses. Its findings cannot be ignored, much as the \nState would like this Court to do so. \n\nUnder  Rule  52(a),  a  reviewing  court  may  not \nreverse  the  factfinder  merely  because  it  “would  have \ndecided  the  case  differently.” Anderson,  470  U.S.  at \n573. And “[w]here there are two permissible views of \nthe  evidence,  the  factfinder’s  choice  between  them” \nmust control. Id. at 574; accord Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at \n1465 (“A finding that is ‘plausible’ in light of the full \nrecord—even  if  another  is  equally  or  more  so—must \ngovern.”). Rule 52(a) thus guarantees that the merits \ntrial  remains  the  “main  event”  rather  than  merely  a \n\n\f43 \n\n“tryout on the road” to appellate review. Anderson, 470 \nU.S. at 575 (citation omitted). \n\n2. In the joint trial on the 2013 congressional and \nstate  house  plans  conducted  during  the  summer  of \n2017, the district court heard extensive testimony with \nrespect  to  the  legislative  process  in  2013—evidence \nthat provided direct support for its conclusion that the \nLegislature  acted  with  a  discriminatory  motive.  The \ndistrict  court  properly  relied  on  the  guidance  this \nCourt provided in Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at 264-\n68, for inquiring into legislative intent. See H.J.S. App. \n340a. \n\nThe  district  court  found that  the  Legislature  did \nnot  actually  believe  that  “passing  the  interim  maps \nwould  end  the  litigation.”  H.J.S.  App.  358  n.45.  It \npointed  out  that  legislative  leaders  had  made  self-\ncontradictory  statements  about  the  rationale  for  the \nreenactment  and  that  the  Legislature’s  own  legal \nadvisor  had  explained  to  legislators  that  reenacting \nthe maps was unlikely to resolve the litigation. Id.  \n\nAdditionally, the court found that the Legislature \n“pushed the [2013] redistricting bills through quickly” \nwith  no  real  discussion  of  district  configurations. \nH.J.S. App. 354a. It further found that “‘[t]his hurried \npace, of course, strongly suggests an attempt to avoid \nin-depth  scrutiny.’”  C.J.S.  App.  304a  (quoting  N.C. \nState Conference of the NAACP v. McCrory, 831 F.3d \n204, 228 (4th Cir. 2016), cert. denied, 137 S. Ct. 1399 \n(2017)).  Finally,  the  court  found  that  the  purported \nlegislative  findings  regarding  the  2013  plan  were  in \nfact  produced  ahead  of  time  by  the  Texas  Attorney \nGeneral to provide cover for the Legislature’s retention \nof the existing districts. H.J.S. App. 355a n.41. \n\n\f44 \n\nOne  of  the  primary  concerns  of  incumbents  in \nNueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas  Counties  was  to  check  the \ngrowing power of minority communities that could get \nthem “unelected,” M.D.A. App. 279a; see supra pages \n4-7,  10-11.  That  incentive  to  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength remained just as powerful in 2013 as it had \nbeen  two  years  before.  And  as  this  Court  recognized \nwith respect to Texas’s last round of reapportionment, \nshoring  up  an  incumbent’s  district  in  the  face  of \n“diminishing  electoral  support”  from  a  growing \nminority  community  “bears  the  mark  of  intentional \ndiscrimination  that  could  give  rise  to  an  equal \nprotection  violation.” LULAC v. Perry,  548  U.S.  399, \n440 (2006). \n\nGiven all this evidence, the district court did not \nerr  in  its  ultimate  finding  of  fact:  that  the  2013 \nLegislature’s  intent  was  to  preserve  the  districts  the \nLegislature  had  drawn  in  2011  that  had  not  already \nbeen struck down by the district court.  \n\n3.  Texas  is  simply  wrong  to  argue  that  any \nconsideration  of  the  intent  behind  Plan  H283  is \nsomehow  a  “once-bitten-forever-damned  mentality,” \nTexas  Br.  34.  Leaving  aside  that  this  case  hardly \ninvolves  “once”  and  “forever,”  this  Court  has \nconsistently  declared \ncourts  adjudicating \nthat \nintentional  discrimination  claims  can  look  at  the \nhistorical evidence. \n\nWhen  a  provision’s  “original  enactment  was \nmotivated by a desire to discriminate . . . on account of \nrace,”  and  it  “continues  to  this  day”  to  have  a \ndiscriminatory  effect,  then  the  provision  “violates \nequal protection under Arlington Heights.” Hunter v. \nUnderwood, 471 U.S. 222, 233 (1985). Evidence of past \ndiscrimination,  as  this  Court  explained  in Rogers v. \n\n\f45 \n\nLodge,  “is  relevant  to  drawing  an  inference  of \npurposeful  discrimination,  particularly \nin  cases” \nwhere  prior  purposefully  discriminatory  enactments \nare  “replaced  by  laws  and  practices  which,  though \nneutral  on  their  face,  served  to  maintain  the  status \nquo.”  458  U.S.  at  625.  In  particular,  the  fact  that \n“[s]ome  of \nthe  more  blatantly  discriminatory \n[provisions in a law]” have already been “struck down \nby the courts” in no way “legitimate[s]” the remaining \nprovisions. Hunter, 471 U.S. at 233. Those principles \nbear directly on this case. \n\nTexas is not telling the whole truth when it claims \nthat it enacted Plan H358 because it “wanted to bring \nthe  litigation  to  an  end.”  Texas  Br.  2.  The  complete \ntruth  is  that  Texas  wanted  to  bring this  litigation  to \nan  end  in order to keep in place the districts its \nLegislature had drawn in 2011 for discriminatory \nreasons. \n\nIf Texas had wanted to bring this litigation to an \nend correctly, it had two options. First, it could have \ndrawn  a  new  apportionment  plan  that  neither \nintentionally  nor  unintentionally  diluted  minority \nvoting  strength.  Had  it  done  so,  appellees  would  not \nhave  continued  to  challenge  the  districts.  Second, \nTexas  could  have  defended  the  merits  of  its  districts \nand  brought  the  litigation  to  an  end  by  winning  the \ncase.  What  Texas  cannot  do  is  end  the  litigation  by \nleaving the court at halftime and asking the referees \nto declare it the winner. \n\nBy deciding to retain the districts it had drawn in \n2011, Texas retained both the assets and the liabilities \nof  those  districts.  One  of  those  liabilities  is  that  the \nchallenged  districts  in  Nueces,  Bell,  and  Dallas \n\n\f46 \n\nCounties  were  the  product  of  intentional  efforts  to \ndilute minority voting strength. \n\nThe district court was entitled to infer that when \n“a  substantially  similar  Legislature  with  the  same \nleadership” drew exactly the same districts “only two \nyears  after”  it  first  created  them,  H.J.S.  App. 352a \nn.37, it did so for the same reasons. That inference is \nparticularly  defensible  when  the  reenactment  was \n“pushed . . .  through  quickly,”  id.  354a,  with  no \ndiscussion or debate over concerns raised by minority \nlegislators. \n\nUnder  the  circumstances,  the  district  court  was \npresented  with  only  two  explanations  for  the  repeal-\nand-reenactment  strategy:  The  State  claimed  it  kept \nthe  2011  lines  in  place  in  the  challenged  districts \nbecause it thought that the district court had somehow \nblessed  them  in  2012,  and  that  the  court  would \ntherefore  rule  in  its  favor  on  the  merits;  appellees \nclaimed that the State kept the 2011 lines in place for \nthe  same  reason  it  had  adopted  them—to  dilute \nminority voting strength. The district court’s decision \nto  resolve  this  dispute  against  the  State  is  the \nquintessential  factfinding  entitled  to  deference  from \nthis Court. The United States is wrong to label this an \nimproper  “presumption  of  persistent  discrimination.” \nU.S.  Br.  32.  The  district  court  simply  followed  the \nevidence where it led. \n\nthe \n\nfinding \n\nPut  another  way, \n\nof  past \ndiscrimination  here  shows  that  the  United  States’s \nargument  about  a  “particularly  strong”  presumption \nin favor of Texas’s Plan H358 has gotten things exactly \nbackwards.  As  Justice  Thomas  explained  in  United \nStates v. Fordice,  505  U.S.  717  (1992),  when  a  state \nkeeps  in  place  a  system  originally  adopted  for \n\n\f47 \n\ndiscriminatory reasons,  that original intent remains \nrelevant  “both  because  the  State  has  created  the \ndispute  through  its  own  prior  unlawful  conduct  and \nbecause  discriminatory  intent  does  tend  to  persist \nthrough time.” Id. at 746-47 (Thomas, J., concurring) \n(citing Keyes, 413 U.S. at 209-10, and Hazelwood Sch. \nDist. v. United States, 433 U.S. 299, 309-10 (1977)). \n\nThe  district  court,  in  considering  evidence  from \n2011 in adjudicating the legality of the 2013 plan, did \nnot commit legal error. Indeed, ignoring that evidence \nwould have been flatly inconsistent with this Court’s \nprecedent. \n\nC.  Plaintiffs  in  intentional  vote  dilution  cases \nneed not prove that it would be possible to draw \nadditional majority-minority districts. \n\nTexas’s final argument with respect to the district \ncourt’s findings of intentional discrimination rests on \nthe premise that “to establish the effects prong of an \nintentional-vote-dilution claim, a plaintiff must prove \nthat there is ‘the possibility of creating more than the \nexisting number of reasonably compact districts with \na  sufficiently  large  minority  population  to  elect \ncandidates  of  [the  minority  group’s]  choice.’”  Texas \nBr. 49 (first quoting LULAC, 548 U.S. at 430, and then \nquoting  Johnson v. De Grandy,  512  U.S.  997,  1008 \n(1994)). \n\nTexas is wrong. Neither of the cases it cites were \nresolved as intentional vote dilution claims. Applying \nthe correct standard for assessing effects with respect \nto  such  claims  under  either  Section  2  or  the \nFourteenth  Amendment,  this  Court  should  reject \nTexas’s  argument  that  there  was  no  “vote-dilutive \n\n\f48 \n\neffect” in Nueces, Bell, and Dallas Counties, see Texas \nBr. 53-54, 58-59, 60-61. \n\n1.  Requiring  plaintiffs  to  show  the  possibility  of \ncreating  additional  majority-minority  districts  is  an \nartifact  of  a  particular  kind  of  claim:  vote  dilution \nunder  the  “results”  test  of  Section  2.  As  this  Court \nexplained  in  Gingles,  this  requirement  is  essential \nwhen  the  injury  the  plaintiffs  assert  is  the  state’s \nfailure to draw such a district. See 478 U.S. at 49-51. \nBy  definition,  if  such  a  district cannot  be drawn,  the \nstate’s  failure  to  draw  it  cannot  be  the  basis  for \nliability. See id. at 50. \n\nBut  as  this  Court  has  repeatedly  recognized,  an \napportionment  adopted  for  discriminatory  reasons \ncannot  be  upheld  even  if  its  effect  “was,  standing \nalone,  perfectly  legal.”  City of Pleasant Grove v. \nUnited States,  479  U.S.  462,  471  n.11  (1987). To  the \ncontrary,  “[a]n  official  action”  when  “taken  for  the \npurpose of discriminating” on account of race “has no \nlegitimacy  at  all  under  our  Constitution.”  Id. \n(emphasis added) (quoting City of Richmond v. United \nStates,  422  U.S.  358,  378 \n(1975)).  Legislative \napportionments violate the Fourteenth Amendment if \n“‘conceived or operated as purposeful devices to further \nracial discrimination’ by minimizing, cancelling out or \ndiluting the voting strength of racial elements in the \nvoting population.” Rogers, 458 U.S. at 617 (emphasis \nadded) (citation omitted). \n\nTo  be  sure,  absent  discriminatory  purpose,  a \njurisdiction does not violate federal law simply by not \ndrawing  districts  that  would  have  increased  a  small \nminority  group’s  voting  strength.  Bartlett  v. \nStrickland,  556  U.S.  1,  14-20  (2009)  (plurality \nopinion).  But  the  limitation  says  nothing  about \n\n\f49 \n\ncircumstances like those in the present case, in which \na state has acted with a discriminatory purpose. To the \ncontrary,  Justice  Kennedy’s  plurality  opinion  in \nBartlett expressly stated that the Gingles precondition \nof  showing  that  “the  minority  population  in  the \npotential  election  district  is  greater than 50  percent” \nsimply  “does  not  apply  to  cases  in  which  there  is \nintentional discrimination against a racial minority.” \nId. at 20.  \n\n2.  The  Bartlett plurality’s  reliance  on  Garza v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1990), \nsee Bartlett,  556  U.S.  at  20,  supports  the  following \nproposition:  When  there  has  been  a  showing  of \nintentional  discrimination, \nthe \nFourteenth  Amendment  or  Section  2  is  established \nwhenever the challenged district makes it harder for \nthe  minority  community  to  participate  effectively  in \nthe political process. \n\nliability  under \n\nIn  this  case,  the  district  court  found  that  the \n\nchallenged districts had exactly that effect. \n\nthe \n\nStart  with  Nueces  County.  Because  much  of  the \nLatino population there was deliberately “packed” into \none  district  to  buttress  the  prospects  of  an  Anglo \nlegislator in another district, those Latinos left behind \nin \noverwhelmingly  Anglo  district  were \n“marginalized.”  M.D.A.  App.  102a.  Similarly,  in  Bell \nCounty,  the  Legislature’s  decision  to  split  Killeen \nminimized  the  voting  strength  of  a  multi-minority \ncoalition. H.J.S. App. 19a-22a. And in Dallas County, \nthe  district  court  found  that  the  Legislature  had \n“unnecessarily plac[ed] Latinos in HD103 and HD104 \nwhile  simultaneously  making  HD105  more  Anglo  in \norder to protect the Anglo” incumbent and to minimize \nLatino political power. See id. 172a. \n\n\f50 \n\nGiven  the  adverse  consequences \n\nfor  those \ncounties’ minority citizens, the district court correctly \nheld that appellees had proved a violation of Section 2 \nand  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.  What  the  remedy \nshould be can be determined on remand.14 \n\nIII. The  configuration  of  the  districts  in  Nueces \nCounty violates Section 2’s “results” test. \n\nIn  addition  to  holding  that  the  configuration  of \nHD32  and  HD34  violated  federal  law  because  the \nLegislature’s  adoption  of  those  districts  was  the \nproduct  of  intentional  racial  discrimination,  the \ndistrict  court  held  that  the  configuration  violated \nSection  2’s  “results”  test  “insofar  as  two  compact \nHCVAP-majority opportunity districts could be drawn \nwithin  Nueces  County.”  H.J.S.  App.  85a.  This  Court \nneed  not  address  that  alternative  holding  if,  as \nappellees  have  urged,  it  affirms  the  district  court’s \nfindings  with  regard \nintentional \ndiscrimination-based  claims.  But  if  the  Court  does \nreach that holding, it should affirm. \n\nto  appellees’ \n\nContrary to the State’s assertion, Texas Br. 65, the \ndistrict court did not conclude that it was impossible \nto  draw  two  minority  opportunity  districts  within \nNueces  County.  While  there  was  some  uncertainty \nover how well Latino voters would fare if the Section 2 \nremedy  involved  doing  nothing  beyond  reconfiguring \nthe  two  districts  wholly  within  Nueces  County,  see \nH.J.S. App. 50a, 58a-59a, the court found that a Latino \nvoting population that “continues to climb” would over \n\n14  The  fact  that  the  remedy  for  the  State’s  intentional \ndiscrimination  has  not  yet  been  adjudicated  reinforces  the \nconclusion  that  this  Court  lacks  jurisdiction  over  the  State’s \npremature appeal. See supra pages 29-34. \n\n                                            \n\f51 \n\ntime  give  Latino  voters  “a  significant  advantage  in \nhouse district elections” in both districts; indeed, “they \ncould easily control elections.” Id. 55a, 57a-58a. Thus, \nafter  extensive  discussion,  the  court  explained  that \nwhile  two  such  districts  might  not  offer  “the  best \nconfiguration for minority success,” id. 59a, they would \narguably provide an “opportunity to win elections,” see \nid. 56a (emphasis omitted). \n\nTexas’s claim that the district court “recognized” \nthat  a  second  majority-Latino  district  in  Nueces \nCounty  would  produce  an  “over-representation”  of \nLatino  voters  in  the  county,  Texas  Br.  67  (quoting \nH.J.S.  App.  51a),  rips  a  phrase  out  of  context.  The \ndistrict court’s remark came in the course of pointing \nout,  as  part  of \nits  totality-of-the-circumstances \nanalysis, that making both districts in Nueces County \nmajority-Latino  should  not  undermine  finding  a \nSection 2 violation, given that even with two majority-\nLatino districts in Nueces County, Latinos “statewide \nwould still be under-represented.” H.J.S. App. 51a. \n\nTexas  has  not  challenged  the  district  court’s \nfindings regarding the demographics of past, present, \nand potential districts within Nueces County. Nor has \nit  challenged  the  district  court’s  findings  regarding \nracial  polarization  and  socioeconomic  disparities \naffecting  Latino  political  participation  within  the \ncounty.  Given  that  appellees  have  satisfied  all  the \nGingles  preconditions,  see supra pages  7-8—and  in \nlight  of  the  fact  that  the  district  court  has  not  yet \ndecided whether it will require a remedy that creates \ntwo  majority-Latino  districts  within  Nueces  County, \nH.J.S.  App. 60a-61a—this  Court  should  affirm  the \ndistrict  court’s  ruling  with  respect  to  the  Section  2 \nresults claim against HD32 and HD34. \n\n\f52 \n\nIV.  HD90 in Tarrant County is an unconstitutional \n\nracial gerrymander. \n\nUnder Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630 (1993), and its \nprogeny,  an  electoral  district  violates  the  equal \nprotection clause when: “(1) race is the ‘dominant and \ncontrolling’ or ‘predominant’ consideration in deciding \n‘to  place  a  significant  number  of  voters  within  or \nwithout a particular district,” and (2) “the use of race \nis  not  ‘narrowly  tailored  to  serve  a  compelling  state \ninterest.’” Ala. Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, \n135  S.  Ct.  1257,  1264  (2015)  (first  quoting Miller v. \nJohnson,  515  U.S.  900,  913,  916  (1995),  and  then \nquoting Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 902 (1996)). \n\nTexas does not contest the district court’s finding \nthat race was the predominant factor “motivating the \ndecision  of  which  individuals  to  place  within  and \nwithout HD90” when its boundaries were reconfigured \nby  the  Legislature  in  2013,  H.J.S.  App.  77a.  The \nthe  witnesses’ \ndistrict \ntestimony,  deemed  the  explanation  for  the  HD90’s \nboundaries  given  by  the  legislator  and  staff  member \nwho drew it “as naked a confession as there can be to \nmoving  voters  into  and  out  of  districts  purely  on  the \nbasis  of  race.”  Id.  81a.  Thus,  the  district  properly \nsubjected HD90 to strict scrutiny. \n\ncourt,  which  observed \n\nTexas’s sole defense is that the State was entitled \nto  engage  in  this  deliberate  racial  gerrymander  in \norder to comply with a Voting Rights Act mandate to \n“maintain[]  HD90  as  a  majority-Hispanic  district.” \nTexas  Br.  69.  That  defense  is  meritless.  The  2013 \nchanges  made  to  HD90  involved  neither  a  genuine \ncompelling government interest nor narrow tailoring. \nAnd because “HD90 actually was redrawn by the 2013 \nLegislature,”  id.  at  34,  it  undermines  the  State’s \n\n\f53 \n\nrefrain that in 2013, the State “enacted a House plan \nthat  made  only  minor  changes”  to  the  legislatively \ndrawn  districts  that  had  been  left  intact  under  the \ndistrict court’s 2012 interim remedy, id. at 26. \n\nis  whether \n\nthe  government’s \n\n(1989)—not  whether \n\n1. When strict scrutiny applies, as it does here, the \n“actual \nquestion \npurpose[]”  in  relying  on  a  suspect  classification  is  a \ncompelling one, City of Richmond v. J.A. Croson Co., \n488  U.S.  469,  495 \nthe \ngovernment can proffer an “hypothesized or invented \npost hoc ”  justification  “in  response  to  litigation,” \nUnited States v. Virginia,  518  U.S.  515,  533  (1996). \nHere,  the  district  court  concluded  that  the  real \nmotivation for the 2013 reconfiguration of HD90 had \nnothing  to  do  with  ensuring  compliance  with  the \nVoting Rights Act. H.J.S. App. 81a-83a. As appellees \nhave  already  explained,  see supra pages  41-43,  in \nreviewing  that  factual  finding,  this  Court must  “give \nsingular  deference”  to  the  trial  court’s  credibility \ndeterminations.  Cooper v. Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455, \n1476  (2017).  That  deference  is  warranted  here.  In \naddition,  the  record  more  than  supports  the  district \ncourt’s findings. \n\nTo  begin,  HD90  as  configured  in  2011  was \nmajority-Latino in HCVAP using 2008-2010 ACS data, \nand  majority  SSVR.  M.D.A.  App.  266a.  The  Texas \nAttorney General urged the Legislature to retain that \nconfiguration  as  part  of  the  2013  apportionment \nlegislation. See  H.J.S.  App.  440a.  Thus,  rather  than \nsuggesting that the Voting Rights Act required the use \nof race to redraw HD90’s boundaries, the State’s chief \nthe \nlawyer \nexisting \nretaining \nfollowed  that \nboundaries.  Had  the  Legislature \nadvice—as  it  did  with  respect  to  essentially  all  the \n\nrecommended \n\n\f54 \n\nother districts that had not been altered by the 2012 \ninterim  remedy—HD90  would  have  remained  a \nmajority Hispanic district with no need to deliberately \nand surgically move voters into and out of the district \nbased on their race. There would have been no Shaw \nclaim. \n\nAs Texas acknowledges, the impetus for the 2013 \nboundary manipulations was the incumbent’s desire to \nrecapture a pocket of non-Latino supporters who had \nnot been included within HD90 under the 2011 plan. \nTexas  Br.  69-70.  It  was  the  discretionary  decision  to \nadd  this  non-Latino  population  to  the  district  that \nnecessitated  removing  other  non-Latino  residents  in \norder to retain the district’s demographic character. \n\nthe  state  house \n\nDiscussion of redrawing HD90 to comply with the \nVoting  Rights  Act  appears  nowhere  in  the  2013 \nlegislative  record.  On \nfloor, \nRepresentative  Burnam,  the  amendment’s  author, \nstated only that the new boundaries for HD90 restored \nthe Como precinct to HD90 and also moved Anglos out \nof  HD90  and  minority  voters  into  HD90. See H.J.S. \nApp.  80a-81a.  At  trial,  Burnam  testified  that  his \nstaffer  did  not  track  election  results  while  making \nchanges  to  HD90  because  “[i]t  was  purely  a \ndemographic  exercise.”  Task  Force  M.D.A.  App.  5a. \nThe  district  court  concluded,  after  reviewing  all  the \nevidence, that “no one considered the legal significance \nof  the  [demographic]  target  in  terms  of  compliance \nwith the VRA.” H.J.S. App. 81a-82a. \n\nIn addition to the dearth of evidence showing that \nTexas considered the impact of its changes on Latino \nvoters’  opportunity  to  elect,  the  sequence  of  district \nconfigurations  belies  the  State’s  claim  that  the \ndeliberate  focus  on  race  was  undertaken  for  Voting \n\n\f55 \n\nRights Act compliance. In the usual successful defense \nto a Shaw claim, a state shows that the Voting Rights \nAct requires use of race because the elements of a vote \ndilution claim are present. See, e.g., Cooper, 137 S. Ct. \nat  1470  (“If a  state  has  good  reason  to  think  that all \nthe ‘Gingles preconditions’ are met, then so too it has \ngood  reason  to  believe  that  §  2  requires  drawing  a \nmajority-minority  district.”).  Here,  however,  the \nState’s changes to HD90 were not spurred by a desire \nto create  a  Latino  opportunity  district  in  compliance \nwith  the  Voting  Rights  Act.  HD90  was  already a \nmajority-Latino  district  before  Burnam  proposed \nredrawing  it.  That  the  redrawn  district  actually \n“decrease[d]” \nof  Spanish-surnamed \nregistered  voters  in  the  district,  H.J.S.  App.  73a, \nfurther gives the lie to the State’s rationalizations: It \nis difficult to imagine how the Voting Rights Act would \nrequire predominant use of race to lower the electoral \nstrength of Latinos in an existing Latino opportunity \ndistrict.15 \n\nshare \n\nthe \n\n2.  Nor,  under  the  circumstances,  was  the  use  of \nrace  in  modifying  HD90  narrowly  tailored  to  comply \nwith the Voting Rights Act.  \n\nEven if the district court had found that Texas had \na strong basis in evidence to conclude that the Voting \n\n15  The  Court  should  reject  Texas’s  attempt  to  use  an \nexpression  of  concern  about  this  decrease  made  by  MALC’s \ncounsel as evidence that compliance with the Voting Rights Act \nmotivated  the  Legislature’s  reliance  on  race. See Texas  Br.  70. \nThat concern was expressed in the context of an initial proposal \nby Burnam and Kenney to modify HD90 that would have reduced \nthe number of Latino registered voters in HD90. J.A. 399a. That \nconcern would never have needed to be expressed had the State \nmaintained the 2011 configuration of HD90. \n\n                                            \n\f56 \n\nRights Act required it to maintain the existing SSVR \nlevel  in  HD90,  the  narrowly  tailored  solution  would \nhave been to refrain from moving a heavily non-Latino \nprecinct  into  HD90  and  then  splitting  ten  other \nprecincts  to  move  voters  into  and  out  of  the  district \nbased on race.  \n\nThe  State’s  race-based  redistricting  of  HD90 \ncannot survive strict scrutiny, regardless whether the \nVoting Rights Act required maintaining the district’s \nexisting  SSVR,  because  it  was  eminently  possible  to \nmeet that target without making predominant use of \nrace. Texas had already met that goal in 2011. \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  this  Court  should \ndismiss for lack of jurisdiction or, alternatively, affirm \nthe order of the district court. \n\nRespectfully submitted, \n\n \n \n\f57 \n\nDavid Richards \nRICHARDS, RODRIGUEZ & \n   SKEITH, LLP \n816 Congress Avenue \nSuite 1200 \nAustin, TX 78701 \nCounsel for Appellees \nShannon Perez, et al. \n\nAllison J.
