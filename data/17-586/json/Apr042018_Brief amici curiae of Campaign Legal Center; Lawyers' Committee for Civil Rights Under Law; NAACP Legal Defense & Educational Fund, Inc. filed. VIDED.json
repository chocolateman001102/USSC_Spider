        "INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE1 \n\nAmicus  curiae  Lawyers’  Committee  for  Civil \nRights  Under  Law  (“Lawyers’  Committee”)  was \nformed  in  1963  at  the  request  of  President  John F. \nKennedy to involve private attorneys throughout the \ncountry  in  the  effort  to  ensure  civil  rights  to  all \nAmericans.  Protection  of  the  voting  rights  of  racial \nand  language minorities is an important part of the \nLawyers’  Committee’s  work.  The  Lawyers’  Commit-\ntee  has  represented  litigants  in  numerous  voting \nrights  cases  throughout  the nation over the past 50 \nyears, including cases before this Court. See, e.g., Ar-\nizona  v.  Inter  Tribal  Council  of  Arizona,  Inc.,  570 \nU.S. 1 (2013); Shelby County v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 \n(2013);  Nw.  Austin  Mun.  Util.  Dist.  No. 1 v.

McKeithen,  485 \nF.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1973). \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThis  Court  should  affirm  the  three-judge  court’s \nholding that Texas’s 2013 maps unlawfully furthered \nand  maintained  the  purposeful  dilution  of  minority \nvoting  strength  in  the  2011  maps  and  that the dis-\ntricts  impacted  by  that  purposeful  discrimination \nmust  be  remedied.  Perez  v.  Abbott,  274  F.  Supp. 3d \n624,  649-50,  652  (W.D.  Tex.  2017)  (“Perez  I”)  (“The",
        "4 \n\nLegislature in 2013 intentionally furthered and con-\ntinued the existing discrimination in the plans.”).  \n\nThe  three-judge  court’s  factual  findings  that  the \n2013  maps  carried  over the discriminatory intent of \ntheir  predecessor  maps  are  not  clearly  erroneous. \nThe record demonstrates that the Texas Legislature \nadopted the 2013 maps in a strategic attempt by the \nLegislature to maintain as many of its discriminato-\nry  2011  choices  as  possible  while  insulating  itself \nfrom  further  constitutional  challenge.  This  Court’s \ndiscriminatory  intent  cases  make  clear  that  those \ndiscriminatory 2011 choices are unlawful in the 2013 \nmaps  as  well.  The  three-judge  court  was  not  re-\nquired,  as  Appellants  argue,  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to \nthe context of the 2013 maps. To the contrary, it was \nrequired to engage in the close examination it did of \nthe 2013 maps in light of their inextricable relation-\nship to the 2011 maps. See Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. \n268,  275  (1939)  (“The  [Fifteenth] Amendment nulli-\nfies  sophisticated  as  well as simple-minded modes of \ndiscrimination.”).   \n\nBecause  it  had  been  determined  that  the  2011 \nmaps  contained  districts  drawn  with  discriminatory \nintent,  it  was  Texas’s  burden  to show that the 2013 \nmaps,  which  left  unchanged  districts  that  the  Dis-\ntrict Court held had been drawn with discriminatory \nintent  in  2011,  did  not  maintain  or further that in-\ntent.  But regardless of who bore the burden of proof \nat  that stage of litigation, the three-judge court had \nample  evidence  before  it  to  come  to  its  conclusions \nthat  the 2013 maps were intentionally discriminato-\nry.  Moreover,  any  holding  that  failed  to  eliminate \nthe  discriminatory  choices  of  the  2011  maps  “root",
        "5 \n\nand  branch”  would  have deprived the Plaintiffs of a \ncomplete  remedy  for  Texas’s  purposeful  discrimina-\ntion.  See  Green  v.  County  Sch.  Bd.,  391  U.S.  430, \n437–38 (1968). \n\nFinally,  Texas’s  attempt  to  use  the  three-judge \ncourt’s interim maps as a shield against any further \nremedies is at odds with the purpose of interim relief \nin  redistricting and other time-sensitive election-law \ndisputes. It is well established that such preliminary \nrelief  does  not,  and  could  not, settle the final rights \nof the parties. Indeed here, at the time of the interim \nmap,  the  three-judge  court  warned  that  it  had  not \nfully  adjudicated  the  question  of  which  lines  were \ninfected  with  the  Texas Legislature’s discriminatory \npurpose. When the court did so in its 2017 ruling, it \nfound that the intentional discrimination in the 2011 \nmaps  impacted  more  districts  than  the  three-judge \ncourt  initially  identified  in its preliminary review of \nthe  proposed  interim  map.  Thus,  Texas’s argument, \nif  it  prevailed,  would  profoundly  disrupt  the  incen-\ntives for both courts and parties at the interim stag-\nes  of  litigation  by  establishing  interim  relief  as  the \npotential outer limit of potential final relief even be-\nfore full adjudication of the merits of a case. Texas’s \nlegal  theory  of  the  case—which  seeks  to  transform \nan  interim  remedy  into  a  constitutional  shield—\ncannot stand.",
        "6 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  THE  2013  MAPS  ARE  INEXTRICABLY \nLINKED  TO  THE  DISCRIMINATORY  2011 \nMAPS. \n\nDespite  Texas’s  contrary  representations,  the \n2013  maps  were  not  new  redistricting  maps  born of \nthe three-judge court’s imagination or a new legisla-\ntive  process.  Rather,  the  2013  maps  are  nothing \nmore  than  the  2011  legislatively  enacted  maps  as \npartially  altered  by  the  three-judge  court  based  on \nits  preliminary  findings  of  constitutional  and  statu-\ntory  defects.  Jurisdictional  App.  314a2  (“We  empha-\nsize the preliminary and temporary nature of the in-\nterim plan[.]”).   \n\nIn  2011,  the  Texas Legislature passed redistrict-\ning  maps  for  the  congressional  and state legislative \ndistricts.  These  maps  were  subject  to  pre-clearance \nunder  the  then-applicable  provisions  of  Section  5 of \nthe  Voting  Rights  Act,  and  pre-clearance  litigation \nwas  instituted  by  Texas.  Simultaneously,  Plaintiffs \nchallenged the 2011 maps as racially discriminatory \nunder  the  Constitution  and  Section  2  of  the Voting \nRights Act.  \n\nAfter  Texas  failed  to  obtain  a  timely  pre-\nclearance  decision  from  the  District  Court  for  the \nDistrict  of  Columbia,  the  three-judge  panel  in  this \ncase  drew  a  set  of  interim  maps  to  allow  the  2012 \nTexas  primary  and  general  elections  to  proceed  on \n\n2  Jurisdictional  App.  refers  to  the  Jurisdictional  Appendix \n\nof  Greg  Abbott  et al. (No.  17-626)  (filed  Oct. 27, 2017).",
        "7 \n\nschedule.  Texas  objected  to  this  first  set  of  interim \nmaps  and  appealed  to this Court to ensure that the \nthree-judge  court’s  interim  remedy  maps  would \nmake as few changes as possible based on the court’s \npreliminary review of Plaintiffs’ likely success on the \nmerits. Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 392 (2012). This \nCourt  substantiated  Texas’s  objection.  Id.  at  394 \n(“[T]he  state  plan  serves  as  a  starting  point  for  the \ndistrict  court.  .  .  .  [A]  district  court  should  still  be \nguided by that plan, except to the extent those legal \nchallenges  are shown to have a likelihood of success \non  the  merits.”).3  On  remand,  the three-judge panel \nthen  produced  the  second  set  of  interim  maps  that \nare at issue in this case.  Per this Court’s orders, the \nsecond  set  of  interim  maps  “maintained  the  status \nquo”  except  where  the  three-judge  court  found  that \nthe Plaintiffs, based on preliminary evidence, proved \na  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  of  their  chal-\n\n3  Indeed,  at  that  point  in  the  litigation,  Texas  repeatedly \nargued  to  this  Court  that  the  three-judge  court’s  preliminary \nfindings  and  use  of  an  interim  map  that  largely  followed  the \n2011  map  would  not  be  dispositive  of  the  ultimate  legality  of \nthe  2011  lines.  See,  e.g.,  Reply  Brief  for  Appellants  at  27-28, \nPerry  v.  Perez,  565  U.S.  388  (2012)  (No.  11-713),  2012  WL \n10392,  at  *27-28  (“Requiring  the  district  court  to  make  a  pre-\nliminary  finding  of  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  prior  to \nordering  the  alteration  of  the  State’s  maps  is  thus  consistent \nwith  this  Court’s  precedent,  and  does  not  intrude  upon  the  D.C. \ncourt’s  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  enter  final  rulings  on  preclear-\nance  claims.  In  assessing  whether  to  enter  preliminary  equita-\nble  relief,  district  courts  routinely  make  preliminary  findings \nbefore  engaging  in  a  full  assessment  of  the  merits  .  .  .  There  is \nno  reason  why  interim  redistricting  plans  -  which  are  tempo-\nrary  equitable  remedies  that  apply  only  for  a  single  election \ncycle  - should  be  treated  any differently.”).",
        "8 \n\nlenges.  Perez  v.  Texas,  891  F.  Supp.  2d  808,  816 \n(W.D. Tex. 2012). However, the three-judge court ex-\npressly  stated  that  the  interim  maps  were  not  in-\ntended to address or provide relief for all of the Sec-\ntion  2  or  constitutional  claims  before  it.  Id.  at  812. \nAfter a full trial on the merits, the three-judge court \nfound  that  the  evidence  proved  additional  discrimi-\nnatory defects requiring a broader remedy. See Perez \nI, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 686. \n\nWhile  the  case  before  the  three-judge  court  was \nproceeding, the Texas Legislature took those interim \nmaps—which  the  three-judge  court  warned  did  not \nnecessarily  remedy  all  the  defects  in  the  enacted \nmaps—and adopted them with no or minimal chang-\nes.  Appellants’  Brief  at  10.  The  Texas  Legislature \nchose  this  route  as  a  deliberate  attempt  to  insulate \nas  many  of  its  initial  2011  line-drawing  choices  as \npossible  from further constitutional review. Jurisdic-\ntional  App. 359a. Such gamesmanship cannot be al-\nlowed  to  circumvent  proper  and  complete  review  of \nthe redistricting plans based on a full trial record.  \n\nAfter  reviewing  all  of  the  evidence,  the  three-\njudge court found that the intentional discrimination \nin the 2011 House and congressional maps impacted \nmore districts than the court initially identified in its \npreliminary review of the proposed interim map. See \nPerez  v.  Abbott,  253  F.  Supp.  3d  864  (W.D.  Tex. \n2017)  (“Perez  II”)  (ruling  on  the  2011  congressional \nmap);  Jurisdictional  App.  88a  (ruling  on  House \nmap).  Because  the  2013  maps  retained  the  lines  of \nthe  districts  drawn  in  2011  with  discriminatory  in-\ntent,  and  Texas  offered  no  additional  rationale  for \nretaining  those  districts,  the  three-judge  court  was",
        "9 \n\nentirely correct in weighing the original 2011 intent \nin  its  evaluation  of  the  2013  plans.  Texas’s  argu-\nments  to  the  contrary  contravene  basic  Fourteenth \nAmendment  principles  on adjudicating and remedy-\ning  intentional  discrimination  and  would  lead  to \nperverse  incentives  with  respect  to  preliminary  or-\nders.4  Texas  cannot  treat  the Legislature’s adoption \nof  interim  maps—maps  in  which Defendants sought \nto retain as many features of the 2011 plans as pos-\nsible—as  a  complete  break  from  the  2011  plans  re-\nquiring  the  three-judge  court  to  turn a blind eye to \nthe initial reasons that the lines were drawn. \n\nII. MAINTENANCE  AND  FURTHERANCE  OF \nINTENTIONALLY  DISCRIMINATORY  AC-\nTIONS  VIOLATE  THE  FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT \n\nThe three-judge court’s finding that “the adoption \nof the interim plans intentionally furthered and con-\ntinued any discrimination that might be found in the \n2011  plans  and incorporated into the 2013 plans” is \n\n4  This  brief  focuses  solely  on  the  issues  that  Texas  has \nraised  based  on  the  claims  of  intentional  vote  dilution.  It  does \nnot  address  the  separate  Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act  re-\nsults  claims  or  the  related,  but  distinct, Shaw  v.  Reno,  509 U.S. \n630  (1993)  type  racial  gerrymandering  claims,  which  the  three-\njudge  court  distinguished  in  footnote  36  of  its  opinion  on  the \n2013  congressional  map.  See  Perez  I,  274  F.  Supp.  3d  at  647 \nn.36.  Because  these  claims  are  legally  and  analytically  distinct, \nit  is  possible  to  affirm  the  district  court’s  ruling  on  the  Appel-\nlees’  Shaw  and  Section  2  results  claims  without  necessarily  af-\nfirming  the  court’s  rulings  on  intentional  vote  dilution,  Texas’s \nassertions  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding.",
        "10 \n\nnot clearly erroneous. Perez I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 652 \n(“The  Legislature  in  2013  intentionally  furthered \nand  continued  the  existing  discrimination  in  the \nplans.”). Nor, as Texas suggests, was the three-judge \ncourt’s consideration of the 2011 intent in evaluating \nthe  2013  plans  legally  improper  in  any  way. Inten-\ntional  maintenance  or  furtherance of discrimination \nis  as  offensive  to  Fourteenth Amendment principles \nas  an  initial  discriminatory act. The 2013 maps un-\ndoubtedly maintain and further features in the 2011 \nmaps that the District Court determined were inten-\ntionally  discriminatory.  Under  similar  circumstanc-\nes,  this  Court  has  found  that  subsequent  iterations \nof  discriminatory  laws  continue  to  carry  improper \nintent  and,  therefore,  must  be  voided.  Texas  bears \nthe  burden  of  proving  that  the  2013  maps  are  not \ntainted  with  the  discriminatory  intent  behind  the \n2011  maps  and  it  has  failed  to  carry  that  burden. \nBut,  as  discussed  below,  regardless  of  which  party \nbears  the  burden,  the  District  Court’s  factual  find-\nings  were  not  clearly  erroneous  and  were  based  on \nample evidence of continuing discriminatory intent. \n\nA.  Purposeful  Maintenance  and Furthering \nof  Discriminatory  Intent  Compel a Find-\ning of Discriminatory Intent. \n\n Where  a  subsequent  act  retains  discriminatory \nfeatures  of  a  prior  act—and  particularly  does  so \nwithout  further  debate  and without offering new ra-\ntionales  for  those  features—the  evidence  weighs \nheavily in favor of finding that the prior discrimina-\ntory  intent  infects the current act. This follows from \nthis  Court’s  admonition  that  a  governmental action \nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment when “the deci-",
        "11 \n\nsionmaker,  in  this  case  a  state  legislature,  selected \nor reaffirmed  a particular course of action at least in \npart  ‘because  of,’  not  merely  ‘in spite of,’ its adverse \neffects  upon  an  identifiable  group.”  Pers.  Adm’r  of \nMassachusetts  v.  Feeney,  442  U.S.  256,  279  (1979) \n(emphasis added).  \n\nHaving  found,  in  accordance  with  the factors set \nforth  in  Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. \nDev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), that the 2011 maps \nwere  drawn  with  discriminatory  intent,  the  three-\njudge  court  appropriately  viewed  the  2013  maps  in \nthe  context  of  its  full legislative history. This Court \nhas  instructed  lower  courts  to  rely  on  the  intent  of \npredecessor  discriminatory  laws  if  subsequent  acts \nmaintain  those  same  provisions.  See  Arlington \nHeights,  429  U.S.  at  267-68  (instructing trial courts \nto  consider  “[t]he  historical  background  of  the  deci-\nsion  .  .  .  particularly  if  it  reveals  a  series  of  official \nactions  taken  for invidious purposes” as well as “the \nspecific  sequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  chal-\nlenged  decision”  and  “the  legislative  or  administra-\ntive history”).  \n\nImportantly, in noting the relevance of the histor-\nical  background  to  the  intent  inquiry,  the  Court  in \nArlington  Heights  cited  to  Lane.  Id.  In  Lane,  this \nCourt  determined  that  Oklahoma’s  new registration \nscheme  largely  incorporated  the  discrimination  of  a \nintentionally  discriminatory  grandfather \nprior \nclause.  307  U.S.  at  275-77.  The  Court  stated  that \nfederal  courts  must  ensure  that  the  Fifteenth \nAmendment  is  enforced to “nullif[y] sophisticated as \nwell  as  simple-minded  modes  of  discrimination.”  Id. \nat  275.  As  with  the scheme in Lane, the 2013 maps",
        "12 \n\n“partake  too  much  of  the  infirmity  of  the  [2011 \nmaps] to be able to survive.” Id. \n\nSimilarly,  in  Hunter  v.  Underwood,  this  Court \nconsidered  the  issue  of  whether  the  passage of time \nand  subsequent  events  had  eliminated  the  original \ndiscriminatory  intent  behind  a  provision  in  Ala-\nbama’s  constitution  that  had  disenfranchised  per-\nsons  convicted  of  crimes  of  “moral  turpitude.”  471 \nU.S. 222, 223-24  (1985). Because the core provisions \nof the law stood unchanged, this Court ruled that the \nprovision  retained  its  original  discriminatory  intent \ndespite  the  substantial  passage  of  time.  Id.  at  233. \nWhile  Texas  argues  that  Hunter  is  inapplicable be-\ncause  there  was  a  new  enactment  here,  unlike  in \nHunter,  such  facile  analysis  is  insufficient.  Hunter \nwas  concerned  with  whether  a  provision  originally \nenacted  with  discriminatory  intent  remained  in  the \nlaw  and  continued  to  have  a  harmful  impact.  Id. \nThat  is  the  case  here.  While  Hunter  reserved  the \nquestion  of  whether  a  distinct  passage  of  the  same \nlaw  “without  any  impermissible  motivation”  would \npass  muster,  id.,  there  is  no  evidence  here  that the \n2013  maps  are  independent  from  the  2011  maps \npassed with impermissible motivation.  \n\nIn  the  education  context,  this  Court  has  also \nstressed  that  purposeful  maintenance  of discrimina-\ntory  features  of  a  law  can  equally  offend  the  Four-\nteenth  Amendment.  This  is  particularly  the  case  if \nthose  discriminatory  features  cannot  be  otherwise \njustified.  In  United  States  v. Fordice, this Court ex-\nplained that: \n\nIf  the  State  perpetuates  policies  and \npractices  traceable  to  its  prior  system",
        "13 \n\nthat  continue  to  have  segregative  ef-\nfects-whether  by  influencing  student \nenrollment  decisions  or  by  fostering \nsegregation  in  other  facets  of  the  uni-\nversity  system-and  such  policies  are \nwithout  sound  educational  justification \nand  can  be  practicably  eliminated,  the \nState  has  not  satisfied  its  burden  of \nproving  that it has dismantled its prior \nsystem.  \n\n505 U.S. 717, 731 (1992).  \n\nApplying these factors to Texas’s 2013 maps, it is \nclear that they still carry the prior unlawful discrim-\ninatory  intent.  Indeed,  the  exact  district  lines  that \nthe  three-judge  court  found  were  drawn  with  dis-\ncriminatory intent are unmodified in the 2013 maps. \nNor does the record evidence provide a sound justifi-\ncation  for  the  maintenance  of  those  lines.  Nowhere \nin the legislative record is there any rationale for the \n2013  maps  independent  of  a  desire  to  maintain  as \nmuch of the 2011 maps, including the discriminatory \nchoices  that  escaped  the three-judge court’s prelimi-\nnary  analysis,  as  possible.  The  Legislature  under-\ntook  no  new analysis of the potential discriminatory \nimpact of the maps. Indeed, every single amendment \noffered  to  address  lingering  constitutionality  con-\ncerns  was  summarily  rejected.  See  Jurisdictional \nApp. 247a. \n\nThus  no new intent or purpose can be attributed \nto  the  lines  in  question.  The  three-judge  court  cor-\nrectly found that the Legislature rubberstamped the \ninterim  maps  as  part  of  a  litigation  strategy  to  de-",
        "14 \n\nprive  Plaintiffs of a complete remedy for discrimina-\ntion. Perez I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 649.  \n\nIt is undeniably within the Legislature’s preroga-\ntive to try to remedy unlawful maps to end protract-\ned  litigation.  But  that  is  not  what  the  three-judge \ncourt found occurred.  Instead, it found that the Leg-\nislature’s  litigation  strategy  was  “discriminatory  at \nits  heart”  and  sought  to  insulate  harmful  and  dis-\ncriminatory choices from lawful remedies. Id. at 651. \nUnder  these  circumstances,  the  three-judge  court \nwas  correct  in  finding  that  the  taint  of  the  original \ndiscriminatory  intent  was  not  removed  but  instead \n“intentionally furthered.”5 Id. at 652. \n\nGiven  these  facts,  Texas’s  reliance  on  Palmer  v. \nThompson  is  telling.  Appellants’  Brief  at  32.  Texas \nrelies on the following statement from Palmer:  \n\nFurthermore, there is an element of fu-\ntility in a judicial attempt to invalidate \n\n5  Cotton  v.  Fordice,  157  F.3d  388  (5th  Cir.  1998),  which \nTexas  cites,  does  not  help  Texas.  In  Cotton,  the  Fifth  Circuit \nfound  that  a  criminal  disenfranchisement  law  was  sufficiently \nremoved  from  the  taint  of  its  predecessor  law.  157  F.3d  at  391. \nHowever,  in  that  case,  the  legislature  made  meaningful  chang-\nes  to  the  law  through  a  deliberative  process  and  those  changes \ndemonstrated  lack  of  discriminatory  intent.  Id.  The  Fifth  Cir-\ncuit  also  relied  on  the  significant  passage  of  time  between  the \noriginal  and  new  law.  Id.  Here,  the  2013  maps  were  passed \nquickly,  without  deliberation,  and  only  two  years  after  the  orig-\ninal  discriminatory  maps  were  adopted.  No  changes  were  made \nthat  showed  any  intent  other  than  to  keep  as  many  of  the  lines \nof  the  2011  plans  as  possible.",
        "15 \n\na  law  because  of  the  bad  motives of its \nsupporters. If the law is struck down for \nthis  reason,  rather  than  because  of  its \nfacial  content  or  effect,  it  would  pre-\nsumably be valid as soon as the legisla-\nture  or  relevant  governing  body  re-\npassed it for different reasons. \n\n403 U.S. 217, 225 (1971). Apparently, Texas believes \nthat  this  Court’s  jurisprudence  allows  a  legislative \nbody to re-pass a discriminatory law so long as it in-\ntroduces  some non-discriminatory pretext for the re-\npassage.  \n\nPalmer  also  pre-dates this Court’s modern Equal \nProtection jurisprudence. The Court in Palmer noted \nthat “no case in this Court has held that a legislative \naction may violate equal protection solely because of \nthe  motivations  of  the  men  who  voted  for  it.” Id. at \n224.  In  Washington  v.  Davis,  this  Court  limited \nPalmer’s holding and disavowed any suggestion that \na  “close  inquiry  into  the  purpose  of  a  challenged \nstatute”  is  not  necessary  to  constitutional  adjudica-\ntion.  426  U.S.  229,  244  n.11  (1976).  The  Court  has \nmade clear that a decision motivated at least in part \nby  discriminatory  intent  can  violate  the Equal Pro-\ntection  Clause.  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  265-\n66.  This Court has rejected such litigation strategies \nto launder discriminatory intent before and it should \ndo so here. \n\nIn McCreary County v. Am. Civil Liberties Union \nof  Kentucky,  the  Court  “dispatched  quickly”  the  de-\nfendants’  argument that the purpose inquiry should \nbe  limited to the “latest news about the last in a se-\nries  of  governmental  actions”:  “[T]he  world  is  not",
        "16 \n\nmade  brand  new  every  morning,  and  the  Counties \nare  simply  asking  us to  ignore  perfectly  probative \nevidence;  they  want  an  absentminded  objective  ob-\nserver, not one presumed to be familiar with the his-\ntory  of  the  government’s  actions  and  competent  to \nlearn  what  history  has  to  show.”  545  U.S.  844,  866 \n(2005)  (citing Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v.  Doe, 530 \nU.S.  290,  308  (2000)). Moreover, the Court was able \nto  smoke out easily statements that “were presented \nonly  as  a  litigation position” and that therefore had \nlittle  relevance  to  the  question of intent. Id. at 871. \nHere,  the  three-judge  court  engaged  in  the  same \nclose  inquiry  of  intent:  based  on its familiarity with \nthe history of the 2013 maps, it determined that any \nnew statements of purpose were mere litigation posi-\ntions  and  that  the  district  lines  drawn  in  2011  to \nharm minority voters were maintained for that same \nreason. Those findings are not clearly erroneous.  \n\nAmici  are  not  suggesting  that  the  taint  of  prior \ndiscriminatory  intent  forever  handcuffs  a  Legisla-\nture;  however,  the  evidence  presented here suggest-\ned  intent  to  maintain  discrimination  rather  than \neliminate  it.  If  the  Texas  Legislature  drew  maps \nanew,  deliberated  over  them,  and  engaged  in  an \nopen  and  democratic  process,  and  ultimately  main-\ntained  some  2011  lines  while  changing  others,  the \nstory  might  be  different.  That  is  not  the  record  be-\nfore this Court.",
        "17 \n\nB.  Texas  Has  the  Burden  of  Proving  That \nthe  2013  Maps  Did  Not  Maintain or Fur-\nther  the  Discriminatory  Intent  Behind \nthe 2011 Maps. \n\nFor  all  the  reasons  described  above,  the  three-\njudge  court  had  sufficient  evidence  before  it  to  find \nthat  the  2013  maps  were infected by discriminatory \npurpose  regardless  of  who  bore  the  burden  in  this \nstage  of  the  litigation.  However,  this  Court’s  juris-\nprudence  suggests  that  Texas  bore  the  burden  of \nproving  that  the  2013  maps—which  maintained  as \nmany  of  the  2011  lines  as possible at the time—did \nnot  carry  the  taint  of  the  2011  Legislature’s  inten-\ntional  discrimination.  This  issue  has  come  before \nthis Court most often in the context of desegregation. \nIn  that  context,  this  Court  has  held  that  “given an \ninitially  tainted policy, it is eminently reasonable to \nmake  the  State  bear  the  risk of nonpersuasion with \nrespect to intent at some future time . . . because . . . \nthe  State  has  created  the  dispute  through  its  own \nprior unlawful conduct.” Fordice, 505 U.S. at 746–47; \nsee  also  Keyes  v.  Sch.  Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 209 \n(1973) (“In the context of racial segregation in public \neducation,  the  courts…have  recognized  a  variety  of \nsituations  in  which  ‘fairness’'  and  ‘policy’  require \nstate authorities to bear the burden of explaining ac-\ntions  or conditions which appear to be racially moti-\nvated.”).  \n\nAnalogously,  once  state-sponsored discrimination \nis  found,  this  Court  has routinely sanctioned a bur-\nden-shifting framework that requires a State actor to \nprove that an act would have been taken absent that \ndiscrimination:  “Once  racial  discrimination is shown",
        "18 \n\nto have been a ‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor be-\nhind  enactment  of  the  law,  the  burden  shifts to the \nlaw’s  defenders  to  demonstrate  that  the  law  would \nhave  been  enacted  without  this factor.” Hunter, 471 \nU.S. at 228  (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of \nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)); see also N. \nCarolina  State  Conference  of  NAACP  v.  McCrory, \n831  F.3d  204,  221  (4th  Cir.  2016),  cert.  denied  sub \nnom. North Carolina v. N. Carolina State Conference \nof  NAACP,  137  S.  Ct.  1399  (2017).  That  burden-\nshifting  framework  should  not  be  changed  where  a \nlegislature  does  nothing  but  rubberstamp  prior  dis-\ncriminatory provisions in a new package.  \n\nIII. INTENTIONAL  DISCRIMINATION  RE-\n\nQUIRES A COMPLETE REMEDY  \n\nThe  three-judge  court’s  holding  is correct for an-\nother  related  reason:  anything  less  than  the  three-\njudge  court’s  finding  that  the  discriminatory  lines \nmaintained  without  change  in  the  2013  maps  must \nbe remediated would deprive the Plaintiffs who chal-\nlenged  the  initial  2011  maps  of  the  full  remedy  to \nwhich they are entitled.  \n\nA  law  passed  with  discriminatory  intent  has  “no \nlegitimacy  at  all  under  our  Constitution.”  City  of \nRichmond v. United States, 422 U.S. 358, 378 (1975). \nAnd  the  racial  discrimination  of  that  law  must  “be \neliminated root and branch.” Green, 391 U.S. at 437–\n38.  The  benchmark  for  any  remedy  for  unconstitu-\ntional  discrimination  is  whether  it  “place[s]  the  vic-\ntims  of  discrimination  in  ‘the  position  they  would \nhave  occupied  in  the  absence  of  discrimination.’” \nUnited  States  v.  Virginia,  518  U.S.  515,  547  (1996)",
        "19 \n\n(quoting  Milliken  v.  Bradley,  433  U.S.  267,  280 \n(1977)). \n\nThe legislative choices underlying an intentional-\nly  discriminatory law are owed no deference whatso-\never.  See  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  265-66.  At \nthe  time  of  the  interim  maps,  the  three-judge court \nhad not fully adjudicated the question of which lines \nwere  infected  with  the  Legislature’s  discriminatory \npurpose. When it completed its analysis based on the \nfuller  record  presented  at  trial,  it  determined  more \ndistricts were impacted by that purpose than it orig-\ninally identified at the time that it drew the interim \nmaps under the pressure of impending election dead-\nlines.  Therefore,  the  legislative  choices  that  the \nthree-judge  court  left  in  place  in  the  interim  maps \nout of deference were not entitled to any such defer-\nence in designing a permanent remedy.  \n\nWhere a court finds that the state has acted with \nunconstitutional  discriminatory  intent,  “the  court \nhas  not  merely  the  power  but  the  duty  to  render  a \ndecree  which  will  so  far  as  possible  eliminate  the \ndiscriminatory  effects  of  the  past  as well as bar like \ndiscrimination  in  the  future.”  Louisiana  v.  United \nStates,  380  U.S.  145,  154  (1965).  Under  the  2013 \nplans,  the  three-judge  court  determined  that  many \npurposeful  discriminatory  choices  from  the  2011 \nplans  continued  to  injure  Plaintiffs  and dilute their \nvoting strength. See Perez II, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 875; \nPerez I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 652.  \n\nThat  some  of  the  discriminatory  choices  were \nidentified and eliminated in the interim maps is not \nsufficient  to right these wrongs. See Dillard v. Bald-\nwin  County  Comm’n,  694  F.  Supp.  836,  843  (M.D.",
        "20 \n\nAla.  1988),  aff’d  862  F.2d  878  (11th  Cir.  1988)  (re-\njecting  a  state-proposed  remedy  that  was  “still  a \nproduct  of  the  legislature’s  intentional  racial  dis-\ncrimination” and holding that “deleting just one fea-\nture of [a discriminatory] at-large system would [not] \ndelete  the  invidious  taint  of  this  broad  legislative \nscheme”);  N.  Carolina  State  Conference  of  NAACP, \n831 F.3d at 240  (“But, even if the State were able to \ndemonstrate  that  the  amendment  lessens  the  dis-\ncriminatory  effect  of  the  photo  ID  requirement,  it \nwould  not  relieve  us  of  our  obligation  to  grant  a \ncomplete remedy in this case. That remedy must re-\nflect our finding that the challenged provisions were \nmotivated by an impermissible discriminatory intent \nand must ensure that those provisions do not impose \nany lingering burden on African American voters.”). \n\n The  three-judge  court  was  correct  to  order  a \ncomplete remedy for the intentional harms to minor-\nities  perpetuated  by  the  2013  plans.  Anything  less \nwould  not  “place  the  victims of [Texas’s] discrimina-\ntion in the position they would have occupied in the \nabsence  of discrimination.” See Virginia, 518 U.S.  at \n565; see also City of Port Arthur v. United States, 459 \nU.S.  159,  168  (1982)  (holding  that  “in  light  of  the \nprior findings of discriminatory purpose,” the district \ncourt’s  elimination  of the majority vote requirement \nin  the  proposed  remedial  plan  “was  a  reasonable \nhedge  against  the  possibility  that  the  [remedial] \nscheme  contained  a  purposefully  discriminatory  el-\nement”);  Louisiana,  380  U.S.  at  154-155  (enjoining \nan  unconstitutional  literacy  test  and  a  new  subse-\nquently  enacted  test  because,  even  if  the  new  test \nwas  nondiscriminatory,  it  perpetuated  the  discrimi-",

AN  INTERIM  REMEDIAL  ORDER  DOES \nNOT  SET  THE  FINAL  CONTOURS  OF  RE-\nLIEF \n\nTexas’s argument regarding the legal significance \nof its legislature adopting the three-judge court’s in-\nterim  plans  as  its  enacted  plans  misconstrues  the \nnature  of  preliminary  relief.  Texas  argues:  “[O]ne \nwould  have  thought  there  was  one  reasonably  safe \ncourse  available  to  bring  [redistricting  litigation]  to \nan  end—namely,  enacting  the  three-judge  court’s \nremedial  redistricting plan as the legislature’s own.” \nAppellants’  Brief  at 1. That might be true of a  final \nremedial plan but it is certainly not true of a prelim-\ninary remedy at an early stage in the case.  \n\nIt is well established that such preliminary relief \ndoes  not  and  could  not  settle  the  final  rights of the \nparties. “The purpose of such interim equitable relief \nis not to conclusively determine the rights of the par-\nties  but  to  balance  the  equities  as  the  litigation \nmoves  forward.”  Trump  v.  Int’l  Refugee  Assistance \nProject,  137  S.  Ct.  2080,  2087  (2017)  (per  curiam) \n(internal citations removed); see also Walters v. Nat’l \nAss’n  of  Radiation  Survivors,  473  U.S.  305,  317 \n(1985)  (“[A]ny  conclusions  reached  at  the  prelimi-\nnary  injunction  stage  are  subject  to  revision[.]”); \nUniv.  of  Texas  v.  Camenisch,  451  U.S.  390,  395 \n(1981). Although Texas argues that it “took the court \nat  its  word  that  those  maps  complied  with the Con-\nstitution  and  the  VRA,”  Appellants’  Brief  at  1,  the \ncourt  did  not  make  that  assertion.  To  the  contrary, \nthe  order  warned  both  parties  that the map did not",
        "22 \n\nrepresent  “a  final  judgment on the merits as to any \nclaim  or  defense  in  this  case.”  Jurisdictional  App. \n315a.  \n\nThus,  Texas’s  description  of  the  three-judge \ncourt’s  ruling,  which  drives  many  of  its  legal  argu-\nments, is fatally flawed:   \n\nAccording  to  the  district  court,  its  own \nmaps  were  infected  with  the  “taint  of \ndiscriminatory intent”—a taint that the \nLegislature  (but  apparently  not  the \ncourt)  was  obligated  to  “remove”  if  it \nwanted  to  adopt  those  maps  as  state \nlaw rather than just abide by them as a \njudicial decree.  \n\nAppellants’ Brief at 1. The three-judge court eventu-\nally concluded that its interim and preliminary order \ndid not identify all of the discriminatory choices that \nthe Texas Legislature engaged in. If the Texas Legis-\nlature  had  not  enacted  the  2013  plan  into  law,  the \nthree-judge  court  would  assuredly  have  altered  its \nown  remedial  map  to  remove  those  discriminatory \nchoices  in  its  final  remedial  order.  Thus,  the  three-\njudge  court  is  not imposing any double standard on \nTexas but merely recognizing its duty to alter inter-\nim  relief based on final merits findings. That is how \ninterim and final relief work.   \n\nTexas’s argument, if it prevailed, would profound-\nly  disrupt  the  incentives for both courts and parties \nat  the  interim  stages  of  litigation.  This  Court  has \nurged  district courts, in fashioning interim remedial \nrelief  in  redistricting  matters,  to  defer  as  much  as \npossible  to  state  legislative  policy  choices  and  re-",
        "23 \n\nquire plaintiffs to meet their burden of proving like-\nlihood of success on the merits of a challenge to alter \nthose  choices.  See  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  393-94.  Yet, \nironically,  if  Texas’s  position  prevails,  three-judge \ncourts  may  often  skew  their  results  to  provide \nbroader  relief  at  the  preliminary  stage  in  order  to \nmaintain their discretion to fashion appropriate final \nrelief.  That  is  because  Texas’s  argument  creates  a \none-way  ratchet  where  awarding  additional relief at \nthe  final  stage may be exceedingly difficult. So long \nas the state accepts the interim relief as its own, the \ncourt  will  lose  its  authority  to  determine  that  more \nrelief  is  necessary  after  review  of a full record. This \napproach,  while  attractive  to  Texas  at  this  moment \nto protect this map, is harmful to the process overall. \nIt  creates  incentives  for  district  courts  to  provide \ngreater  preliminary  relief  with  the  knowledge  that \nsuch relief can be scaled back but may impose a ceil-\ning.  Such  incentives  run  directly  counter  to  this \nCourt’s  admonition  that  “[r]edistricting  is ‘primarily \nthe  duty  and responsibility of the State’” and courts \nshould be reticent to disturb state choices. Id. at 392 \n(quoting Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975)).  \n\nThis  strategy  will  also  disrupt  the  incentives  for \nnegotiation  at  the  interim  stage.  Interim  relief  in \nelections-related  cases  is  often  urgent,  requiring \nquick  and decisive action in time for relief to be put \ninto  place  prior  to  an  upcoming  election.  See,  e.g., \nPurcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006). These interim \nplans  are  often  negotiated  compromises  among  the \nparties.  Indeed,  this  plan  was  not  drawn  by  the \nthree-judge court but by Defendants and some Plain-\ntiff  groups.  Perez  v.  Texas,  891  F.  Supp.  2d  at  825. \nNegotiation  and  compromise  among  the  parties  at",
        "24 \n\nthe  interim  stage  helps  preserve  judicial  resources \nand ensure timely relief. It should be encouraged.  \n\nBut  Texas’s  strategy,  if  successful,  will  prevent \nplaintiffs from engaging in good-faith compromise in \nthe  interest  of  agreed  upon  interim  relief  if  that \nmeans  they  are  creating obstacles to complete relief \nat  the  final  stage.  Moreover,  courts  will  be hesitant \nto  accept  a  compromise plan if it may prevent them \nfrom  awarding  full  relief  in  the  future.  This  is  par-\nticularly  true  if,  as  was  the  case  here,  only  some \nplaintiffs  agree  to  the  compromise  plan.  If  Texas \nsucceeds,  courts  would  be  right  to  reject  such  com-\npromise  plans  that  may  trade  away  the  rights  of \nother  plaintiffs  without  full  adjudication.  The  end \nresult  of  Texas’s  legal  theory  is  that  parties  will  be \nseeking this Court’s interference at the interim stage \nof many more redistricting matters.  \n\nTexas’s  legal  theory  of  the  case  fundamentally \nmisunderstands the role of interim relief in the judi-\ncial  process.  Moreover,  the  incentive  structure  it \nwould create is unnecessary and harmful to the abil-\nity  of  courts  and  parties  to fashion interim relief. It \nshould be rejected.",

McKeithen,  485 \nF.2d 1297 (5th Cir. 1973). \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nThis  Court  should  affirm  the  three-judge  court’s \nholding that Texas’s 2013 maps unlawfully furthered \nand  maintained  the  purposeful  dilution  of  minority \nvoting  strength  in  the  2011  maps  and  that the dis-\ntricts  impacted  by  that  purposeful  discrimination \nmust  be  remedied.  Perez  v.  Abbott,  274  F.  Supp. 3d \n624,  649-50,  652  (W.D.  Tex.  2017)  (“Perez  I”)  (“The \n\n \n \n \n\f4 \n\nLegislature in 2013 intentionally furthered and con-\ntinued the existing discrimination in the plans.”).  \n\nThe  three-judge  court’s  factual  findings  that  the \n2013  maps  carried  over the discriminatory intent of \ntheir  predecessor  maps  are  not  clearly  erroneous. \nThe record demonstrates that the Texas Legislature \nadopted the 2013 maps in a strategic attempt by the \nLegislature to maintain as many of its discriminato-\nry  2011  choices  as  possible  while  insulating  itself \nfrom  further  constitutional  challenge.  This  Court’s \ndiscriminatory  intent  cases  make  clear  that  those \ndiscriminatory 2011 choices are unlawful in the 2013 \nmaps  as  well.  The  three-judge  court  was  not  re-\nquired,  as  Appellants  argue,  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to \nthe context of the 2013 maps. To the contrary, it was \nrequired to engage in the close examination it did of \nthe 2013 maps in light of their inextricable relation-\nship to the 2011 maps. See Lane v. Wilson, 307 U.S. \n268,  275  (1939)  (“The  [Fifteenth] Amendment nulli-\nfies  sophisticated  as  well as simple-minded modes of \ndiscrimination.”).   \n\nBecause  it  had  been  determined  that  the  2011 \nmaps  contained  districts  drawn  with  discriminatory \nintent,  it  was  Texas’s  burden  to show that the 2013 \nmaps,  which  left  unchanged  districts  that  the  Dis-\ntrict Court held had been drawn with discriminatory \nintent  in  2011,  did  not  maintain  or further that in-\ntent.  But regardless of who bore the burden of proof \nat  that stage of litigation, the three-judge court had \nample  evidence  before  it  to  come  to  its  conclusions \nthat  the 2013 maps were intentionally discriminato-\nry.  Moreover,  any  holding  that  failed  to  eliminate \nthe  discriminatory  choices  of  the  2011  maps  “root \n\n \n \n\f5 \n\nand  branch”  would  have deprived the Plaintiffs of a \ncomplete  remedy  for  Texas’s  purposeful  discrimina-\ntion.  See  Green  v.  County  Sch.  Bd.,  391  U.S.  430, \n437–38 (1968). \n\nFinally,  Texas’s  attempt  to  use  the  three-judge \ncourt’s interim maps as a shield against any further \nremedies is at odds with the purpose of interim relief \nin  redistricting and other time-sensitive election-law \ndisputes. It is well established that such preliminary \nrelief  does  not,  and  could  not, settle the final rights \nof the parties. Indeed here, at the time of the interim \nmap,  the  three-judge  court  warned  that  it  had  not \nfully  adjudicated  the  question  of  which  lines  were \ninfected  with  the  Texas Legislature’s discriminatory \npurpose. When the court did so in its 2017 ruling, it \nfound that the intentional discrimination in the 2011 \nmaps  impacted  more  districts  than  the  three-judge \ncourt  initially  identified  in its preliminary review of \nthe  proposed  interim  map.  Thus,  Texas’s argument, \nif  it  prevailed,  would  profoundly  disrupt  the  incen-\ntives for both courts and parties at the interim stag-\nes  of  litigation  by  establishing  interim  relief  as  the \npotential outer limit of potential final relief even be-\nfore full adjudication of the merits of a case. Texas’s \nlegal  theory  of  the  case—which  seeks  to  transform \nan  interim  remedy  into  a  constitutional  shield—\ncannot stand.  \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\f6 \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  THE  2013  MAPS  ARE  INEXTRICABLY \nLINKED  TO  THE  DISCRIMINATORY  2011 \nMAPS. \n\nDespite  Texas’s  contrary  representations,  the \n2013  maps  were  not  new  redistricting  maps  born of \nthe three-judge court’s imagination or a new legisla-\ntive  process.  Rather,  the  2013  maps  are  nothing \nmore  than  the  2011  legislatively  enacted  maps  as \npartially  altered  by  the  three-judge  court  based  on \nits  preliminary  findings  of  constitutional  and  statu-\ntory  defects.  Jurisdictional  App.  314a2  (“We  empha-\nsize the preliminary and temporary nature of the in-\nterim plan[.]”).   \n\nIn  2011,  the  Texas Legislature passed redistrict-\ning  maps  for  the  congressional  and state legislative \ndistricts.  These  maps  were  subject  to  pre-clearance \nunder  the  then-applicable  provisions  of  Section  5 of \nthe  Voting  Rights  Act,  and  pre-clearance  litigation \nwas  instituted  by  Texas.  Simultaneously,  Plaintiffs \nchallenged the 2011 maps as racially discriminatory \nunder  the  Constitution  and  Section  2  of  the Voting \nRights Act.  \n\nAfter  Texas  failed  to  obtain  a  timely  pre-\nclearance  decision  from  the  District  Court  for  the \nDistrict  of  Columbia,  the  three-judge  panel  in  this \ncase  drew  a  set  of  interim  maps  to  allow  the  2012 \nTexas  primary  and  general  elections  to  proceed  on \n\n2  Jurisdictional  App.  refers  to  the  Jurisdictional  Appendix \n\nof  Greg  Abbott  et al. (No.  17-626)  (filed  Oct. 27, 2017). \n\n \n \n                                                 \n \n\f7 \n\nschedule.  Texas  objected  to  this  first  set  of  interim \nmaps  and  appealed  to this Court to ensure that the \nthree-judge  court’s  interim  remedy  maps  would \nmake as few changes as possible based on the court’s \npreliminary review of Plaintiffs’ likely success on the \nmerits. Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 392 (2012). This \nCourt  substantiated  Texas’s  objection.  Id.  at  394 \n(“[T]he  state  plan  serves  as  a  starting  point  for  the \ndistrict  court.  .  .  .  [A]  district  court  should  still  be \nguided by that plan, except to the extent those legal \nchallenges  are shown to have a likelihood of success \non  the  merits.”).3  On  remand,  the three-judge panel \nthen  produced  the  second  set  of  interim  maps  that \nare at issue in this case.  Per this Court’s orders, the \nsecond  set  of  interim  maps  “maintained  the  status \nquo”  except  where  the  three-judge  court  found  that \nthe Plaintiffs, based on preliminary evidence, proved \na  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  of  their  chal-\n\n3  Indeed,  at  that  point  in  the  litigation,  Texas  repeatedly \nargued  to  this  Court  that  the  three-judge  court’s  preliminary \nfindings  and  use  of  an  interim  map  that  largely  followed  the \n2011  map  would  not  be  dispositive  of  the  ultimate  legality  of \nthe  2011  lines.  See,  e.g.,  Reply  Brief  for  Appellants  at  27-28, \nPerry  v.  Perez,  565  U.S.  388  (2012)  (No.  11-713),  2012  WL \n10392,  at  *27-28  (“Requiring  the  district  court  to  make  a  pre-\nliminary  finding  of  a  likelihood  of  success  on  the  merits  prior  to \nordering  the  alteration  of  the  State’s  maps  is  thus  consistent \nwith  this  Court’s  precedent,  and  does  not  intrude  upon  the  D.C. \ncourt’s  exclusive  jurisdiction  to  enter  final  rulings  on  preclear-\nance  claims.  In  assessing  whether  to  enter  preliminary  equita-\nble  relief,  district  courts  routinely  make  preliminary  findings \nbefore  engaging  in  a  full  assessment  of  the  merits  .  .  .  There  is \nno  reason  why  interim  redistricting  plans  -  which  are  tempo-\nrary  equitable  remedies  that  apply  only  for  a  single  election \ncycle  - should  be  treated  any differently.”). \n\n \n \n                                                 \n \n\f8 \n\nlenges.  Perez  v.  Texas,  891  F.  Supp.  2d  808,  816 \n(W.D. Tex. 2012). However, the three-judge court ex-\npressly  stated  that  the  interim  maps  were  not  in-\ntended to address or provide relief for all of the Sec-\ntion  2  or  constitutional  claims  before  it.  Id.  at  812. \nAfter a full trial on the merits, the three-judge court \nfound  that  the  evidence  proved  additional  discrimi-\nnatory defects requiring a broader remedy. See Perez \nI, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 686. \n\nWhile  the  case  before  the  three-judge  court  was \nproceeding, the Texas Legislature took those interim \nmaps—which  the  three-judge  court  warned  did  not \nnecessarily  remedy  all  the  defects  in  the  enacted \nmaps—and adopted them with no or minimal chang-\nes.  Appellants’  Brief  at  10.  The  Texas  Legislature \nchose  this  route  as  a  deliberate  attempt  to  insulate \nas  many  of  its  initial  2011  line-drawing  choices  as \npossible  from further constitutional review. Jurisdic-\ntional  App. 359a. Such gamesmanship cannot be al-\nlowed  to  circumvent  proper  and  complete  review  of \nthe redistricting plans based on a full trial record.  \n\nAfter  reviewing  all  of  the  evidence,  the  three-\njudge court found that the intentional discrimination \nin the 2011 House and congressional maps impacted \nmore districts than the court initially identified in its \npreliminary review of the proposed interim map. See \nPerez  v.  Abbott,  253  F.  Supp.  3d  864  (W.D.  Tex. \n2017)  (“Perez  II”)  (ruling  on  the  2011  congressional \nmap);  Jurisdictional  App.  88a  (ruling  on  House \nmap).  Because  the  2013  maps  retained  the  lines  of \nthe  districts  drawn  in  2011  with  discriminatory  in-\ntent,  and  Texas  offered  no  additional  rationale  for \nretaining  those  districts,  the  three-judge  court  was \n\n \n \n\f9 \n\nentirely correct in weighing the original 2011 intent \nin  its  evaluation  of  the  2013  plans.  Texas’s  argu-\nments  to  the  contrary  contravene  basic  Fourteenth \nAmendment  principles  on adjudicating and remedy-\ning  intentional  discrimination  and  would  lead  to \nperverse  incentives  with  respect  to  preliminary  or-\nders.4  Texas  cannot  treat  the Legislature’s adoption \nof  interim  maps—maps  in  which Defendants sought \nto retain as many features of the 2011 plans as pos-\nsible—as  a  complete  break  from  the  2011  plans  re-\nquiring  the  three-judge  court  to  turn a blind eye to \nthe initial reasons that the lines were drawn. \n\nII. MAINTENANCE  AND  FURTHERANCE  OF \nINTENTIONALLY  DISCRIMINATORY  AC-\nTIONS  VIOLATE  THE  FOURTEENTH \nAMENDMENT \n\nThe three-judge court’s finding that “the adoption \nof the interim plans intentionally furthered and con-\ntinued any discrimination that might be found in the \n2011  plans  and incorporated into the 2013 plans” is \n\n4  This  brief  focuses  solely  on  the  issues  that  Texas  has \nraised  based  on  the  claims  of  intentional  vote  dilution.  It  does \nnot  address  the  separate  Section  2  of  the  Voting  Rights  Act  re-\nsults  claims  or  the  related,  but  distinct, Shaw  v.  Reno,  509 U.S. \n630  (1993)  type  racial  gerrymandering  claims,  which  the  three-\njudge  court  distinguished  in  footnote  36  of  its  opinion  on  the \n2013  congressional  map.  See  Perez  I,  274  F.  Supp.  3d  at  647 \nn.36.  Because  these  claims  are  legally  and  analytically  distinct, \nit  is  possible  to  affirm  the  district  court’s  ruling  on  the  Appel-\nlees’  Shaw  and  Section  2  results  claims  without  necessarily  af-\nfirming  the  court’s  rulings  on  intentional  vote  dilution,  Texas’s \nassertions  to  the  contrary  notwithstanding.   \n\n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n\f10 \n\nnot clearly erroneous. Perez I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 652 \n(“The  Legislature  in  2013  intentionally  furthered \nand  continued  the  existing  discrimination  in  the \nplans.”). Nor, as Texas suggests, was the three-judge \ncourt’s consideration of the 2011 intent in evaluating \nthe  2013  plans  legally  improper  in  any  way. Inten-\ntional  maintenance  or  furtherance of discrimination \nis  as  offensive  to  Fourteenth Amendment principles \nas  an  initial  discriminatory act. The 2013 maps un-\ndoubtedly maintain and further features in the 2011 \nmaps that the District Court determined were inten-\ntionally  discriminatory.  Under  similar  circumstanc-\nes,  this  Court  has  found  that  subsequent  iterations \nof  discriminatory  laws  continue  to  carry  improper \nintent  and,  therefore,  must  be  voided.  Texas  bears \nthe  burden  of  proving  that  the  2013  maps  are  not \ntainted  with  the  discriminatory  intent  behind  the \n2011  maps  and  it  has  failed  to  carry  that  burden. \nBut,  as  discussed  below,  regardless  of  which  party \nbears  the  burden,  the  District  Court’s  factual  find-\nings  were  not  clearly  erroneous  and  were  based  on \nample evidence of continuing discriminatory intent. \n\nA.  Purposeful  Maintenance  and Furthering \nof  Discriminatory  Intent  Compel a Find-\ning of Discriminatory Intent. \n\n Where  a  subsequent  act  retains  discriminatory \nfeatures  of  a  prior  act—and  particularly  does  so \nwithout  further  debate  and without offering new ra-\ntionales  for  those  features—the  evidence  weighs \nheavily in favor of finding that the prior discrimina-\ntory  intent  infects the current act. This follows from \nthis  Court’s  admonition  that  a  governmental action \nviolates the Fourteenth Amendment when “the deci-\n\n \n \n\f11 \n\nsionmaker,  in  this  case  a  state  legislature,  selected \nor reaffirmed  a particular course of action at least in \npart  ‘because  of,’  not  merely  ‘in spite of,’ its adverse \neffects  upon  an  identifiable  group.”  Pers.  Adm’r  of \nMassachusetts  v.  Feeney,  442  U.S.  256,  279  (1979) \n(emphasis added).  \n\nHaving  found,  in  accordance  with  the factors set \nforth  in  Village of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. \nDev. Corp., 429 U.S. 252 (1977), that the 2011 maps \nwere  drawn  with  discriminatory  intent,  the  three-\njudge  court  appropriately  viewed  the  2013  maps  in \nthe  context  of  its  full legislative history. This Court \nhas  instructed  lower  courts  to  rely  on  the  intent  of \npredecessor  discriminatory  laws  if  subsequent  acts \nmaintain  those  same  provisions.  See  Arlington \nHeights,  429  U.S.  at  267-68  (instructing trial courts \nto  consider  “[t]he  historical  background  of  the  deci-\nsion  .  .  .  particularly  if  it  reveals  a  series  of  official \nactions  taken  for invidious purposes” as well as “the \nspecific  sequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  chal-\nlenged  decision”  and  “the  legislative  or  administra-\ntive history”).  \n\nImportantly, in noting the relevance of the histor-\nical  background  to  the  intent  inquiry,  the  Court  in \nArlington  Heights  cited  to  Lane.  Id.  In  Lane,  this \nCourt  determined  that  Oklahoma’s  new registration \nscheme  largely  incorporated  the  discrimination  of  a \nintentionally  discriminatory  grandfather \nprior \nclause.  307  U.S.  at  275-77.  The  Court  stated  that \nfederal  courts  must  ensure  that  the  Fifteenth \nAmendment  is  enforced to “nullif[y] sophisticated as \nwell  as  simple-minded  modes  of  discrimination.”  Id. \nat  275.  As  with  the scheme in Lane, the 2013 maps \n\n \n \n\f12 \n\n“partake  too  much  of  the  infirmity  of  the  [2011 \nmaps] to be able to survive.” Id. \n\nSimilarly,  in  Hunter  v.  Underwood,  this  Court \nconsidered  the  issue  of  whether  the  passage of time \nand  subsequent  events  had  eliminated  the  original \ndiscriminatory  intent  behind  a  provision  in  Ala-\nbama’s  constitution  that  had  disenfranchised  per-\nsons  convicted  of  crimes  of  “moral  turpitude.”  471 \nU.S. 222, 223-24  (1985). Because the core provisions \nof the law stood unchanged, this Court ruled that the \nprovision  retained  its  original  discriminatory  intent \ndespite  the  substantial  passage  of  time.  Id.  at  233. \nWhile  Texas  argues  that  Hunter  is  inapplicable be-\ncause  there  was  a  new  enactment  here,  unlike  in \nHunter,  such  facile  analysis  is  insufficient.  Hunter \nwas  concerned  with  whether  a  provision  originally \nenacted  with  discriminatory  intent  remained  in  the \nlaw  and  continued  to  have  a  harmful  impact.  Id. \nThat  is  the  case  here.  While  Hunter  reserved  the \nquestion  of  whether  a  distinct  passage  of  the  same \nlaw  “without  any  impermissible  motivation”  would \npass  muster,  id.,  there  is  no  evidence  here  that the \n2013  maps  are  independent  from  the  2011  maps \npassed with impermissible motivation.  \n\nIn  the  education  context,  this  Court  has  also \nstressed  that  purposeful  maintenance  of discrimina-\ntory  features  of  a  law  can  equally  offend  the  Four-\nteenth  Amendment.  This  is  particularly  the  case  if \nthose  discriminatory  features  cannot  be  otherwise \njustified.  In  United  States  v. Fordice, this Court ex-\nplained that: \n\nIf  the  State  perpetuates  policies  and \npractices  traceable  to  its  prior  system \n\n \n \n\f13 \n\nthat  continue  to  have  segregative  ef-\nfects-whether  by  influencing  student \nenrollment  decisions  or  by  fostering \nsegregation  in  other  facets  of  the  uni-\nversity  system-and  such  policies  are \nwithout  sound  educational  justification \nand  can  be  practicably  eliminated,  the \nState  has  not  satisfied  its  burden  of \nproving  that it has dismantled its prior \nsystem.  \n\n505 U.S. 717, 731 (1992).  \n\nApplying these factors to Texas’s 2013 maps, it is \nclear that they still carry the prior unlawful discrim-\ninatory  intent.  Indeed,  the  exact  district  lines  that \nthe  three-judge  court  found  were  drawn  with  dis-\ncriminatory intent are unmodified in the 2013 maps. \nNor does the record evidence provide a sound justifi-\ncation  for  the  maintenance  of  those  lines.  Nowhere \nin the legislative record is there any rationale for the \n2013  maps  independent  of  a  desire  to  maintain  as \nmuch of the 2011 maps, including the discriminatory \nchoices  that  escaped  the three-judge court’s prelimi-\nnary  analysis,  as  possible.  The  Legislature  under-\ntook  no  new analysis of the potential discriminatory \nimpact of the maps. Indeed, every single amendment \noffered  to  address  lingering  constitutionality  con-\ncerns  was  summarily  rejected.  See  Jurisdictional \nApp. 247a. \n\nThus  no new intent or purpose can be attributed \nto  the  lines  in  question.  The  three-judge  court  cor-\nrectly found that the Legislature rubberstamped the \ninterim  maps  as  part  of  a  litigation  strategy  to  de-\n\n \n \n\f14 \n\nprive  Plaintiffs of a complete remedy for discrimina-\ntion. Perez I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 649.  \n\nIt is undeniably within the Legislature’s preroga-\ntive to try to remedy unlawful maps to end protract-\ned  litigation.  But  that  is  not  what  the  three-judge \ncourt found occurred.  Instead, it found that the Leg-\nislature’s  litigation  strategy  was  “discriminatory  at \nits  heart”  and  sought  to  insulate  harmful  and  dis-\ncriminatory choices from lawful remedies. Id. at 651. \nUnder  these  circumstances,  the  three-judge  court \nwas  correct  in  finding  that  the  taint  of  the  original \ndiscriminatory  intent  was  not  removed  but  instead \n“intentionally furthered.”5 Id. at 652. \n\nGiven  these  facts,  Texas’s  reliance  on  Palmer  v. \nThompson  is  telling.  Appellants’  Brief  at  32.  Texas \nrelies on the following statement from Palmer:  \n\nFurthermore, there is an element of fu-\ntility in a judicial attempt to invalidate \n\n5  Cotton  v.  Fordice,  157  F.3d  388  (5th  Cir.  1998),  which \nTexas  cites,  does  not  help  Texas.  In  Cotton,  the  Fifth  Circuit \nfound  that  a  criminal  disenfranchisement  law  was  sufficiently \nremoved  from  the  taint  of  its  predecessor  law.  157  F.3d  at  391. \nHowever,  in  that  case,  the  legislature  made  meaningful  chang-\nes  to  the  law  through  a  deliberative  process  and  those  changes \ndemonstrated  lack  of  discriminatory  intent.  Id.  The  Fifth  Cir-\ncuit  also  relied  on  the  significant  passage  of  time  between  the \noriginal  and  new  law.  Id.  Here,  the  2013  maps  were  passed \nquickly,  without  deliberation,  and  only  two  years  after  the  orig-\ninal  discriminatory  maps  were  adopted.  No  changes  were  made \nthat  showed  any  intent  other  than  to  keep  as  many  of  the  lines \nof  the  2011  plans  as  possible. \n\n \n \n                                                 \n \n \n\f15 \n\na  law  because  of  the  bad  motives of its \nsupporters. If the law is struck down for \nthis  reason,  rather  than  because  of  its \nfacial  content  or  effect,  it  would  pre-\nsumably be valid as soon as the legisla-\nture  or  relevant  governing  body  re-\npassed it for different reasons. \n\n403 U.S. 217, 225 (1971). Apparently, Texas believes \nthat  this  Court’s  jurisprudence  allows  a  legislative \nbody to re-pass a discriminatory law so long as it in-\ntroduces  some non-discriminatory pretext for the re-\npassage.  \n\nPalmer  also  pre-dates this Court’s modern Equal \nProtection jurisprudence. The Court in Palmer noted \nthat “no case in this Court has held that a legislative \naction may violate equal protection solely because of \nthe  motivations  of  the  men  who  voted  for  it.” Id. at \n224.  In  Washington  v.  Davis,  this  Court  limited \nPalmer’s holding and disavowed any suggestion that \na  “close  inquiry  into  the  purpose  of  a  challenged \nstatute”  is  not  necessary  to  constitutional  adjudica-\ntion.  426  U.S.  229,  244  n.11  (1976).  The  Court  has \nmade clear that a decision motivated at least in part \nby  discriminatory  intent  can  violate  the Equal Pro-\ntection  Clause.  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  265-\n66.  This Court has rejected such litigation strategies \nto launder discriminatory intent before and it should \ndo so here. \n\nIn McCreary County v. Am. Civil Liberties Union \nof  Kentucky,  the  Court  “dispatched  quickly”  the  de-\nfendants’  argument that the purpose inquiry should \nbe  limited to the “latest news about the last in a se-\nries  of  governmental  actions”:  “[T]he  world  is  not \n\n \n \n\f16 \n\nmade  brand  new  every  morning,  and  the  Counties \nare  simply  asking  us to  ignore  perfectly  probative \nevidence;  they  want  an  absentminded  objective  ob-\nserver, not one presumed to be familiar with the his-\ntory  of  the  government’s  actions  and  competent  to \nlearn  what  history  has  to  show.”  545  U.S.  844,  866 \n(2005)  (citing Santa Fe Indep. Sch. Dist. v.  Doe, 530 \nU.S.  290,  308  (2000)). Moreover, the Court was able \nto  smoke out easily statements that “were presented \nonly  as  a  litigation position” and that therefore had \nlittle  relevance  to  the  question of intent. Id. at 871. \nHere,  the  three-judge  court  engaged  in  the  same \nclose  inquiry  of  intent:  based  on its familiarity with \nthe history of the 2013 maps, it determined that any \nnew statements of purpose were mere litigation posi-\ntions  and  that  the  district  lines  drawn  in  2011  to \nharm minority voters were maintained for that same \nreason. Those findings are not clearly erroneous.  \n\nAmici  are  not  suggesting  that  the  taint  of  prior \ndiscriminatory  intent  forever  handcuffs  a  Legisla-\nture;  however,  the  evidence  presented here suggest-\ned  intent  to  maintain  discrimination  rather  than \neliminate  it.  If  the  Texas  Legislature  drew  maps \nanew,  deliberated  over  them,  and  engaged  in  an \nopen  and  democratic  process,  and  ultimately  main-\ntained  some  2011  lines  while  changing  others,  the \nstory  might  be  different.  That  is  not  the  record  be-\nfore this Court.  \n\n \n \n\f17 \n\nB.  Texas  Has  the  Burden  of  Proving  That \nthe  2013  Maps  Did  Not  Maintain or Fur-\nther  the  Discriminatory  Intent  Behind \nthe 2011 Maps. \n\nFor  all  the  reasons  described  above,  the  three-\njudge  court  had  sufficient  evidence  before  it  to  find \nthat  the  2013  maps  were infected by discriminatory \npurpose  regardless  of  who  bore  the  burden  in  this \nstage  of  the  litigation.  However,  this  Court’s  juris-\nprudence  suggests  that  Texas  bore  the  burden  of \nproving  that  the  2013  maps—which  maintained  as \nmany  of  the  2011  lines  as possible at the time—did \nnot  carry  the  taint  of  the  2011  Legislature’s  inten-\ntional  discrimination.  This  issue  has  come  before \nthis Court most often in the context of desegregation. \nIn  that  context,  this  Court  has  held  that  “given an \ninitially  tainted policy, it is eminently reasonable to \nmake  the  State  bear  the  risk of nonpersuasion with \nrespect to intent at some future time . . . because . . . \nthe  State  has  created  the  dispute  through  its  own \nprior unlawful conduct.” Fordice, 505 U.S. at 746–47; \nsee  also  Keyes  v.  Sch.  Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 209 \n(1973) (“In the context of racial segregation in public \neducation,  the  courts…have  recognized  a  variety  of \nsituations  in  which  ‘fairness’'  and  ‘policy’  require \nstate authorities to bear the burden of explaining ac-\ntions  or conditions which appear to be racially moti-\nvated.”).  \n\nAnalogously,  once  state-sponsored discrimination \nis  found,  this  Court  has routinely sanctioned a bur-\nden-shifting framework that requires a State actor to \nprove that an act would have been taken absent that \ndiscrimination:  “Once  racial  discrimination is shown \n\n \n \n\f18 \n\nto have been a ‘substantial’ or ‘motivating’ factor be-\nhind  enactment  of  the  law,  the  burden  shifts to the \nlaw’s  defenders  to  demonstrate  that  the  law  would \nhave  been  enacted  without  this factor.” Hunter, 471 \nU.S. at 228  (citing Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of \nEduc. v. Doyle, 429 U.S. 274, 287 (1977)); see also N. \nCarolina  State  Conference  of  NAACP  v.  McCrory, \n831  F.3d  204,  221  (4th  Cir.  2016),  cert.  denied  sub \nnom. North Carolina v. N. Carolina State Conference \nof  NAACP,  137  S.  Ct.  1399  (2017).  That  burden-\nshifting  framework  should  not  be  changed  where  a \nlegislature  does  nothing  but  rubberstamp  prior  dis-\ncriminatory provisions in a new package.  \n\nIII. INTENTIONAL  DISCRIMINATION  RE-\n\nQUIRES A COMPLETE REMEDY  \n\nThe  three-judge  court’s  holding  is correct for an-\nother  related  reason:  anything  less  than  the  three-\njudge  court’s  finding  that  the  discriminatory  lines \nmaintained  without  change  in  the  2013  maps  must \nbe remediated would deprive the Plaintiffs who chal-\nlenged  the  initial  2011  maps  of  the  full  remedy  to \nwhich they are entitled.  \n\nA  law  passed  with  discriminatory  intent  has  “no \nlegitimacy  at  all  under  our  Constitution.”  City  of \nRichmond v. United States, 422 U.S. 358, 378 (1975). \nAnd  the  racial  discrimination  of  that  law  must  “be \neliminated root and branch.” Green, 391 U.S. at 437–\n38.  The  benchmark  for  any  remedy  for  unconstitu-\ntional  discrimination  is  whether  it  “place[s]  the  vic-\ntims  of  discrimination  in  ‘the  position  they  would \nhave  occupied  in  the  absence  of  discrimination.’” \nUnited  States  v.  Virginia,  518  U.S.  515,  547  (1996) \n\n \n \n\f19 \n\n(quoting  Milliken  v.  Bradley,  433  U.S.  267,  280 \n(1977)). \n\nThe legislative choices underlying an intentional-\nly  discriminatory law are owed no deference whatso-\never.  See  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  265-66.  At \nthe  time  of  the  interim  maps,  the  three-judge court \nhad not fully adjudicated the question of which lines \nwere  infected  with  the  Legislature’s  discriminatory \npurpose. When it completed its analysis based on the \nfuller  record  presented  at  trial,  it  determined  more \ndistricts were impacted by that purpose than it orig-\ninally identified at the time that it drew the interim \nmaps under the pressure of impending election dead-\nlines.  Therefore,  the  legislative  choices  that  the \nthree-judge  court  left  in  place  in  the  interim  maps \nout of deference were not entitled to any such defer-\nence in designing a permanent remedy.  \n\nWhere a court finds that the state has acted with \nunconstitutional  discriminatory  intent,  “the  court \nhas  not  merely  the  power  but  the  duty  to  render  a \ndecree  which  will  so  far  as  possible  eliminate  the \ndiscriminatory  effects  of  the  past  as well as bar like \ndiscrimination  in  the  future.”  Louisiana  v.  United \nStates,  380  U.S.  145,  154  (1965).  Under  the  2013 \nplans,  the  three-judge  court  determined  that  many \npurposeful  discriminatory  choices  from  the  2011 \nplans  continued  to  injure  Plaintiffs  and dilute their \nvoting strength. See Perez II, 253 F. Supp. 3d at 875; \nPerez I, 274 F. Supp. 3d at 652.  \n\nThat  some  of  the  discriminatory  choices  were \nidentified and eliminated in the interim maps is not \nsufficient  to right these wrongs. See Dillard v. Bald-\nwin  County  Comm’n,  694  F.  Supp.  836,  843  (M.D. \n\n \n \n\f20 \n\nAla.  1988),  aff’d  862  F.2d  878  (11th  Cir.  1988)  (re-\njecting  a  state-proposed  remedy  that  was  “still  a \nproduct  of  the  legislature’s  intentional  racial  dis-\ncrimination” and holding that “deleting just one fea-\nture of [a discriminatory] at-large system would [not] \ndelete  the  invidious  taint  of  this  broad  legislative \nscheme”);  N.  Carolina  State  Conference  of  NAACP, \n831 F.3d at 240  (“But, even if the State were able to \ndemonstrate  that  the  amendment  lessens  the  dis-\ncriminatory  effect  of  the  photo  ID  requirement,  it \nwould  not  relieve  us  of  our  obligation  to  grant  a \ncomplete remedy in this case. That remedy must re-\nflect our finding that the challenged provisions were \nmotivated by an impermissible discriminatory intent \nand must ensure that those provisions do not impose \nany lingering burden on African American voters.”). \n\n The  three-judge  court  was  correct  to  order  a \ncomplete remedy for the intentional harms to minor-\nities  perpetuated  by  the  2013  plans.  Anything  less \nwould  not  “place  the  victims of [Texas’s] discrimina-\ntion in the position they would have occupied in the \nabsence  of discrimination.” See Virginia, 518 U.S.  at \n565; see also City of Port Arthur v. United States, 459 \nU.S.  159,  168  (1982)  (holding  that  “in  light  of  the \nprior findings of discriminatory purpose,” the district \ncourt’s  elimination  of the majority vote requirement \nin  the  proposed  remedial  plan  “was  a  reasonable \nhedge  against  the  possibility  that  the  [remedial] \nscheme  contained  a  purposefully  discriminatory  el-\nement”);  Louisiana,  380  U.S.  at  154-155  (enjoining \nan  unconstitutional  literacy  test  and  a  new  subse-\nquently  enacted  test  because,  even  if  the  new  test \nwas  nondiscriminatory,  it  perpetuated  the  discrimi-\n\n \n \n\f21 \n\nnatory  burdens  placed  on  Black  voters  by  the prior \ntest).  \n\nIV. AN  INTERIM  REMEDIAL  ORDER  DOES \nNOT  SET  THE  FINAL  CONTOURS  OF  RE-\nLIEF \n\nTexas’s argument regarding the legal significance \nof its legislature adopting the three-judge court’s in-\nterim  plans  as  its  enacted  plans  misconstrues  the \nnature  of  preliminary  relief.  Texas  argues:  “[O]ne \nwould  have  thought  there  was  one  reasonably  safe \ncourse  available  to  bring  [redistricting  litigation]  to \nan  end—namely,  enacting  the  three-judge  court’s \nremedial  redistricting plan as the legislature’s own.” \nAppellants’  Brief  at 1. That might be true of a  final \nremedial plan but it is certainly not true of a prelim-\ninary remedy at an early stage in the case.  \n\nIt is well established that such preliminary relief \ndoes  not  and  could  not  settle  the  final  rights of the \nparties. “The purpose of such interim equitable relief \nis not to conclusively determine the rights of the par-\nties  but  to  balance  the  equities  as  the  litigation \nmoves  forward.”  Trump  v.  Int’l  Refugee  Assistance \nProject,  137  S.  Ct.  2080,  2087  (2017)  (per  curiam) \n(internal citations removed); see also Walters v. Nat’l \nAss’n  of  Radiation  Survivors,  473  U.S.  305,  317 \n(1985)  (“[A]ny  conclusions  reached  at  the  prelimi-\nnary  injunction  stage  are  subject  to  revision[.]”); \nUniv.  of  Texas  v.  Camenisch,  451  U.S.  390,  395 \n(1981). Although Texas argues that it “took the court \nat  its  word  that  those  maps  complied  with the Con-\nstitution  and  the  VRA,”  Appellants’  Brief  at  1,  the \ncourt  did  not  make  that  assertion.  To  the  contrary, \nthe  order  warned  both  parties  that the map did not \n\n \n \n\f22 \n\nrepresent  “a  final  judgment on the merits as to any \nclaim  or  defense  in  this  case.”  Jurisdictional  App. \n315a.  \n\nThus,  Texas’s  description  of  the  three-judge \ncourt’s  ruling,  which  drives  many  of  its  legal  argu-\nments, is fatally flawed:   \n\nAccording  to  the  district  court,  its  own \nmaps  were  infected  with  the  “taint  of \ndiscriminatory intent”—a taint that the \nLegislature  (but  apparently  not  the \ncourt)  was  obligated  to  “remove”  if  it \nwanted  to  adopt  those  maps  as  state \nlaw rather than just abide by them as a \njudicial decree.  \n\nAppellants’ Brief at 1. The three-judge court eventu-\nally concluded that its interim and preliminary order \ndid not identify all of the discriminatory choices that \nthe Texas Legislature engaged in. If the Texas Legis-\nlature  had  not  enacted  the  2013  plan  into  law,  the \nthree-judge  court  would  assuredly  have  altered  its \nown  remedial  map  to  remove  those  discriminatory \nchoices  in  its  final  remedial  order.  Thus,  the  three-\njudge  court  is  not imposing any double standard on \nTexas but merely recognizing its duty to alter inter-\nim  relief based on final merits findings. That is how \ninterim and final relief work.   \n\nTexas’s argument, if it prevailed, would profound-\nly  disrupt  the  incentives for both courts and parties \nat  the  interim  stages  of  litigation.  This  Court  has \nurged  district courts, in fashioning interim remedial \nrelief  in  redistricting  matters,  to  defer  as  much  as \npossible  to  state  legislative  policy  choices  and  re-\n\n \n \n\f23 \n\nquire plaintiffs to meet their burden of proving like-\nlihood of success on the merits of a challenge to alter \nthose  choices.  See  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  393-94.  Yet, \nironically,  if  Texas’s  position  prevails,  three-judge \ncourts  may  often  skew  their  results  to  provide \nbroader  relief  at  the  preliminary  stage  in  order  to \nmaintain their discretion to fashion appropriate final \nrelief.  That  is  because  Texas’s  argument  creates  a \none-way  ratchet  where  awarding  additional relief at \nthe  final  stage may be exceedingly difficult. So long \nas the state accepts the interim relief as its own, the \ncourt  will  lose  its  authority  to  determine  that  more \nrelief  is  necessary  after  review  of a full record. This \napproach,  while  attractive  to  Texas  at  this  moment \nto protect this map, is harmful to the process overall. \nIt  creates  incentives  for  district  courts  to  provide \ngreater  preliminary  relief  with  the  knowledge  that \nsuch relief can be scaled back but may impose a ceil-\ning.  Such  incentives  run  directly  counter  to  this \nCourt’s  admonition  that  “[r]edistricting  is ‘primarily \nthe  duty  and responsibility of the State’” and courts \nshould be reticent to disturb state choices. Id. at 392 \n(quoting Chapman v. Meier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975)).  \n\nThis  strategy  will  also  disrupt  the  incentives  for \nnegotiation  at  the  interim  stage.  Interim  relief  in \nelections-related  cases  is  often  urgent,  requiring \nquick  and decisive action in time for relief to be put \ninto  place  prior  to  an  upcoming  election.  See,  e.g., \nPurcell v. Gonzalez, 549 U.S. 1 (2006). These interim \nplans  are  often  negotiated  compromises  among  the \nparties.  Indeed,  this  plan  was  not  drawn  by  the \nthree-judge court but by Defendants and some Plain-\ntiff  groups.  Perez  v.  Texas,  891  F.  Supp.  2d  at  825. \nNegotiation  and  compromise  among  the  parties  at \n\n \n \n\f24 \n\nthe  interim  stage  helps  preserve  judicial  resources \nand ensure timely relief. It should be encouraged.  \n\nBut  Texas’s  strategy,  if  successful,  will  prevent \nplaintiffs from engaging in good-faith compromise in \nthe  interest  of  agreed  upon  interim  relief  if  that \nmeans  they  are  creating obstacles to complete relief \nat  the  final  stage.  Moreover,  courts  will  be hesitant \nto  accept  a  compromise plan if it may prevent them \nfrom  awarding  full  relief  in  the  future.  This  is  par-\nticularly  true  if,  as  was  the  case  here,  only  some \nplaintiffs  agree  to  the  compromise  plan.  If  Texas \nsucceeds,  courts  would  be  right  to  reject  such  com-\npromise  plans  that  may  trade  away  the  rights  of \nother  plaintiffs  without  full  adjudication.  The  end \nresult  of  Texas’s  legal  theory  is  that  parties  will  be \nseeking this Court’s interference at the interim stage \nof many more redistricting matters.  \n\nTexas’s  legal  theory  of  the  case  fundamentally \nmisunderstands the role of interim relief in the judi-\ncial  process.  Moreover,  the  incentive  structure  it \nwould create is unnecessary and harmful to the abil-\nity  of  courts  and  parties  to fashion interim relief. It \nshould be rejected.  \n\n \n \n\f25 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  decision  of  the \n\nthree-judge court should be affirmed.  \n\n                                       Respectfully submitted, \n\nKRISTEN CLARKE \nEZRA D.
