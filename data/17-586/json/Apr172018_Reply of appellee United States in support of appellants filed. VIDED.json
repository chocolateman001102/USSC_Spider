        "In the Supreme Court of the United States \n\nNos. 17-586 and 17-626 \n\nGREG ABBOTT, GOVERNOR OF TEXAS, ET AL., APPELLANTS \n\nv. \n\nSHANNON PEREZ, ET AL. \n\nON APPEALS FROM THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT \nFOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS \n\nREPLY BRIEF FOR THE UNITED STATES \n\nPlaintiffs do not meaningfully dispute that the district \ncourt’s  analysis  of  the  intentional-vote-dilution  claims \nrested  on  erroneous  legal  premises.    Instead  of  asking \nwhether  plaintiffs  had  proven  that  the  2013  Legislature \nenacted the 2013 plans for the purpose of harming minor-\nity  voters,  the  court  presumed  that  discriminatory  mo-\ntives of a prior legislature would “carry over” to invalidate \nfuture  legislative  action—the  substance  of  which  that \nsame  court  had  already  provisionally  approved—unless \nthe State established it had affirmatively “removed” the \n“taint” of prior discrimination.  C.J.S. App. 46a.  As our \nopening brief explains, that notion of persistent discrimi-\nnatory intent is directly contrary to the strong presump-\ntion of good faith that should apply when a State adopts \nremedial plans that a court has reviewed and, after adver-\nsarial testing, provisionally found to be lawful.   \n\nThe district court’s treatment of Congressional Dis-\ntrict  35  (CD35)  similarly  rested  on  flawed  legal  prem-\n\n(1)",
        "2 \n\nises.    Because  racial-gerrymandering  claims  are  ad-\ndressed “holistic[ally]” at the “district” level, Bethune-\nHill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, \n800  (2017),  the  absence  of  racially  polarized  voting  in \nTravis County—part of which constitutes, in turn, part \nof CD35—does not demonstrate that the 2013 Legisla-\nture lacked a sound basis to conclude that CD35 satis-\nfied Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA).  On the \ncontrary, the court’s own 2012 decision provisionally re-\njecting plaintiffs’ claims was itself sufficient to give the \nState “good reasons” to believe in 2013 that CD35 was \nlawful.    Id.  at  795.    Plaintiffs’  arguments  do  not  show \notherwise. \n\nI.  THIS  COURT  MAY  EXERCISE  JURISDICTION  OVER \n\nTHESE APPEALS   \nA.  Under 28 U.S.C. 1253, this Court possesses appel-\nlate  jurisdiction over  orders granting  or  denying  inter-\nlocutory or permanent injunctions in three-judge district \ncourt actions brought under 28 U.S.C. 2284(a).  As previ-\nously explained (U.S. Br. 20-23),1 the district court’s Au-\ngust 15 and August 24, 2017 orders are properly under-\nstood to have enjoined future use of the State’s 2013 con-\ngressional  and  State  House  plans  and  are  therefore  \nappealable. \n\n1  “U.S.  Br.”  refers  to  the  United  States’  opening  brief;  “Texas \nBr.” refers to Appellants’ opening brief; “Cong. Br.” refers to plain-\ntiffs’ response brief in No. 17-586; and “House Br.” refers to plain-\ntiffs’  response  brief  in  No.  17-626.    See  U.S.  Br.  1  n.1  (explaining \nother abbreviations).",
        "3 \n\nAs noted by plaintiffs (Cong. Br. 26), the district court \ndid not expressly style its orders as injunctions.2  But that \nconsideration is not dispositive.  As this Court held in in-\nterpreting 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1)—an analogous statute al-\nlowing  for  immediate  appellate  review  of  injunctions—\neven an order not styled as the grant or denial of an in-\njunction  is  nonetheless  appealable  if  the  order  has  the \n“practical effect” of granting or denying injunctive relief; \n“might  have  a  ‘serious,  perhaps  irreparable,  conse-\nquence’ ”;  and  “can  be  ‘effectually  challenged’  only  by \nimmediate appeal.”  Carson v. American Brands, Inc., \n450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (citation omitted).   \n\nThe district court’s orders meet those standards.  See \nU.S. Br. 20-23.  The court found that the 2013 congres-\nsional  and  State  House  plans  contained  “statutory  and \nconstitutional violations” that “must be remedied by ei-\nther  the  Texas  Legislature  or  this  Court.”   C.J.S.  App. \n118a; H.J.S. App. 84a-85a (similar).  The court then gave \nthe  Governor  only  three  days  to  decide  whether  to  call \nthe  Legislature into  special session  to  enact  new redis-\ntricting plans, or instead leave the drawing of new maps \nto the court in highly expedited proceedings.  Those rul-\nings left little doubt that Texas would be forbidden from \nusing its 2013 plans for the 2018 elections.  Had the State \nbeen required to wait until the court entered an express \ninjunction, that order would likely have come too late for \n\n2  Several  plaintiffs  had  requested  immediate  injunctive  relief.  \nSee,  e.g.,  D.  Ct.  Doc.  1525,  at  42  (July  31,  2017)  (plaintiff  MALC) \n(“[T]he  plans  containing  these  defects  must  be  enjoined  and  their \ndefects must be remedied.”); D. Ct. Doc. 1527-1, at 2 (July 31, 2017) \n(Quesada  plaintiffs)  (“The  Court  should  enter  judgment  perma-\nnently enjoining further use of Plan C235.”); D. Ct. Doc. 1529-1, at 1 \n(July 31, 2017) (NAACP plaintiff-intervenors) (“If [the court] finds \nthat such unconstitutional intent existed, it must enter an immedi-\nate and permanent injunction.”).",
        "4 \n\nappellate  review  before  deadlines  associated  with  the \n2018 election cycle.  Under these unusual circumstances, \na  State  whose  existing  legislative  apportionment  plans \nare invalidated in litigation under 28 U.S.C. 2284(a), and \nwhose Governor is given such an ultimatum concerning \nthe State’s legislative process, need not await entry of an \nexpress  injunction  before  obtaining  appellate  review  of \nthe district court’s order.  \n\nB.  1.  Plaintiffs fail to explain why the district court’s \norders do not satisfy Carson’s elements.  They instead ar-\ngue (Cong. Br. 26; House Br. 30) that Carson is inapposite \nto Section 1253.  But Section 1253 contains language ma-\nterially similar to that of Section 1292(a)(1), and plaintiffs \noffer no sound reason why the two statutes should not be \ninterpreted consistently.  Compare 28 U.S.C. 1253 (allow-\ning “appeal  * * *  from an order granting or denying  * * *  \nan interlocutory or permanent injunction”), with 28 U.S.C. \n1292(a)(1) (allowing “appeal[] from  * * *  [i]nterlocutory \norders    * * *    granting,    * * *    refusing  or  dissolving  \ninjunctions”). \n\nIn  opposing  Carson’s  application,  plaintiffs  urge  that \nSection 1253 “is to be narrowly construed.”  House Br. 29 \n(quoting Goldstein v. Cox, 396 U.S. 471, 478 (1970)).  But \nCarson said the same about Section 1292(a)(1).  See Car-\nson, 450 U.S. at 84 (“Because § 1292(a)(1) was intended to \ncarve  out  only  a  limited  exception  to  the  final-judgment \nrule, we have construed the statute narrowly.”); cf. Swit-\nzerland Cheese Ass’n v. E. Horne’s Mkt., Inc., 385 U.S. 23, \n24 (1966) (similar).  And plaintiffs’ assertion (House Br. \n30) that this Court “squarely refused to create a ‘practi-\ncal effect’ exception” in Gunn v. University Committee \nTo End The War In Viet Nam, 399 U.S. 383 (1970) and \nGoldstein  v.  Cox,  supra,  overlooks  that  those  decisions",
        "5 \n\npredated  Carson  and  that  in  neither did the Court dis-\ncuss and reject a practical-effect test.3 \n\nPlaintiffs also suggest (Cong. Br. 27) that the Carson \nframework should apply only when an injunction is effec-\ntively denied, and not when one is effectively granted.  But \nthis Court has stated that Section 1292(a)(1) “provide[s] \nappellate  jurisdiction  over  orders  that    *  *  *    have  the \npractical  effect  of  granting  or  denying  injunctions  and \nhave ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.’ ”  Gulf-\nstream  Aerospace  Corp.  v.  Mayacamas  Corp.,  485  U.S. \n271, 287-288 (1988) (emphasis added; citation omitted). \n\nAn order granting an injunction is, of course, subject \nto procedural requirements under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(d) that do not apply to denials of injunc-\ntions.   See  Gunn,  399 U.S.  at  388.   But  this Court  has \nrecognized  that  an order  may  amount to  an  injunction \nunder 28 U.S.C. 1253 even if it fails to comply with the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Schmidt v. Les-\nsard, 414 U.S. 473, 477 (1974) (per curiam).  Moreover, \nwhatever the precise contours of the “remedy” the dis-\ntrict court might ultimately have entered (Cong. Br. 27), \nit was clear from the court’s orders that the State’s ex-\nisting maps could not be used.  And this Court has re-\nviewed  injunctions  barring  use  of  existing  apportion-\nment plans even though replacement plans had not yet \n\n3  In Goldstein, the plaintiffs sought to appeal the district court’s \ndenial  of  their  summary-judgment  motion.    Although  their  com-\nplaint had “pray[ed] for preliminary as well as permanent injunctive \nrelief,” the plaintiffs had “t[aken] no practical step toward obtaining \nsuch relief,” and the court’s order thus did not constitute the denial \nof  an  injunction.    396  U.S.  at  478-479.    In  Gunn,  the  defendants \nsought to appeal an interlocutory order concluding that a state stat-\nute was unconstitutional.  But the defendants there acknowledged \nthat the order was “no more than ‘an advisory opinion’ ” inasmuch \nas no injunction had yet been entered.  399 U.S. at 389.",
        "6 \n\nbeen drawn.  See, e.g., Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455 \n(2017);  Sixty-Seventh  Minn.  State  Senate  v.  Beens,  \n406 U.S. 187, 190-191, 194-195 (1972) (per curiam). \n\nPlaintiffs  fault  the  United  States  (House  Br.  32)  for \nfailing to distill the Carson framework to a simpler rule \nthat would better “guide future litigants” in assessing ap-\npealability.  But Carson requires consideration of whether \nthe order will have a “ ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, con-\nsequence’ ” and whether it “can be ‘effectually challenged’ \nonly by immediate appeal.”  450 U.S. at 84 (citation omit-\nted).  Those determinations require case-specific analy-\nsis,  including  consideration  of  real-world  deadlines  or \nother  exigencies  confronting  the  appellant.    See,  e.g., \nStovall v. City of Cocoa, 117 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir. \n1997) (court’s effective denial of injunction was immedi-\nately appealable because “trial in the district court [may \nnot] conclude in time to affect the next election”).  \n\n2.  Plaintiffs  also  err  in  suggesting  (House  Br.  32  & \nn.12) that the circumstances here are “nearly identical” \nto those of Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971).  In \nWhitcomb,  the  plaintiffs  filed  suit  in  January  1969;  the \ndistrict  court  issued  its  liability  determination  in  late \nJuly 1969; and that court “ga[ve] the State until October 1, \n1969”—several months later—“to enact legislation rem-\nedying” the violations.  Id. at 131, 137-138.  When the leg-\nislature opted not to act, the court entered its injunctive \norders  in December  1969.   See  id.  at  139;  307  F.  Supp. \n1362  (S.D.  Ind.  1969);  see  also  396  U.S.  1055  (1970) \n(granting  stay);  397  U.S.  984  (1970)  (noting  probable  \njurisdiction).   \n\nThe  chronology  here  was  very  different.    Although \nplaintiffs  promptly  brought  their  relevant  claims  in \n2013, the district court declined to adjudicate them im-\nmediately.  It instead allowed the 2013 plans to be used—",
        "7 \n\nover  plaintiffs’  repeated  objections—for  both  the  2014 \nand 2016 elections.  And in August 2017, when the court \nultimately found the 2013 plans to be invalid, it gave the \nGovernor just three days to decide whether to pursue en-\nactment  of  a  legislative  plan.    C.J.S.  App.  118a;  H.J.S. \nApp. 86a.  It simultaneously scheduled judicial remedial \nhearings for September 5 and 6, 2017—mere weeks be-\nfore  the  State’s  October  1,  2017  deadline  for  finalizing \ndistricts for the 2018 election cycle, and likely too close \nto  that  deadline  to  afford  adequate  time  for  appellate \nreview.  Ibid.4   \n\nII.  PLAINTIFFS  HAVE  FAILED  TO  ESTABLISH  THAT \nTHE 2013 LEGISLATURE ENGAGED IN INTENTIONAL \nVOTE DILUTION  \n\nA.  Plaintiffs Bear The Heavy Burden Of Proving That The \n2013  Legislature  Acted  With  A  Discriminatory  Racial \nPurpose  In  Permanently  Adopting  The  2012  Court- \nOrdered Interim Plans   \n\n1.  As explained in our opening brief (at 24-29), a leg-\nislative redistricting plan may be invalidated on grounds \nof intentional vote dilution only if a plaintiff shows that \nthe  legislature  adopted  that  plan  for  a  discriminatory \npurpose.  In analyzing such a claim, a court must accord \na “presumption of good faith [to] legislative enactments,” \nHunt  v.  Cromartie,  526  U.S.  541,  553  (1999)  (citation \n\n4  Both plaintiffs and the district court acknowledged  the signifi-\ncance of the October 1, 2017 deadline for the timing of further liti-\ngation.  See, e.g., D. Ct. Doc. 1389, at 1 (May 1, 2017) (“The Court is \naware of the condensed schedule that must be implemented in light \nof  the  2018  election  deadlines.”);  D.  Ct.  Doc.  1372,  at  3  (Apr.  24, \n2017)  (NAACP  plaintiffs)  (requesting  expeditious  resolution  be-\ncause “[t]he first steps in the 2018 election process begin early this \nfall”); D. Ct. Doc. 1375, at 2 (Apr. 24, 2017) (African-American Con-\ngressperson plaintiffs) (similar).",
        "8 \n\nomitted), and the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff, \nsee  Reno  v. Bossier  Parish  Sch. Bd.,  520  U.S.  471,  481 \n(1997).  Moreover, although an enactment’s “impact” and \n“historical  background”  are  both  relevant,  Village  of  \nArlington  Heights  v.  Metropolitan  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  \n429  U.S.  252,  266-267 (1977),  courts  must not  infer  dis-\ncriminatory intent solely from disparate effects, see U.S. \nBr. 27-28, and a finding of past intentional discrimination \nalone  ordinarily  cannot  sustain  an  inference  of  present \ndiscrimination, see id. at 28.   \n\nAs also explained (U.S. Br. 29-31), this Court’s cases \nsuggest the further principle that a court should afford \nparticular weight in the discriminatory-purpose assess-\nment to a state legislature’s enactment undertaken in re-\nliance on a court-ordered remedial plan.  When a court \nhas found in a reasoned decision that a court-ordered in-\nterim redistricting plan redresses all likely violations of \nlaw,  and  when  the  legislature  permanently  adopts  that \nplan to replace its original enactment, the normal pre-\nsumption  of  good  faith  accorded  to  legislative  enact-\nments is heightened by the State’s acceptance of the ju-\ndicially approved plan.  It is appropriate for plaintiffs to \nbear a heavy burden in establishing that a state legisla-\nture’s  adoption  of  a  court-ordered  plan  was  intention-\nally discriminatory.  \n\n2.  Plaintiffs’ response briefs do not dispute that the \ndistrict court’s legal analysis was inconsistent with the \nforegoing  principles.    Plaintiffs  instead  argue  (House \nBr. 35-40; Cong. Br. 27-34) that those principles should \nnot be applied in this particular case.  Those arguments \nare unpersuasive. \n\nPlaintiffs’ chief submission is that the principles set \nforth  in  our  opening  brief  are  irrelevant  because  this \ncase  does  not  involve  a  “court-drawn”  or  “judicial[ly]”",
        "9 \n\ncreated plan.  House Br. 1, 19, 27, 39-40; see Cong. Br. \n1,  24.   Plaintiffs emphasize  that  most  districts at  issue \nhere were first drawn in the State’s 2011 legislative plans, \nnot in the 2012 interim plans.5  But our argument rests on \nthe fact that the interim plans were “judicially approved” \nand “court-ordered” (U.S. Br. 18, 30), not on the mistaken \nunderstanding  that  the  districts  were  “court-drawn”  in \nthe first instance.  What matters is that the court evalu-\nated  the  particular  plans  at  issue;  provisionally  found \nthem to be lawful; and ordered their use for future elec-\ntions.  Once a court has made such determinations, it is \nappropriate  to  presume  that  a  state  legislature  acts  in \ngood  faith  if  it  then  adopts  the  judicially  approved  dis-\ntricts in permanent redistricting plans.   \n\nPlaintiffs also emphasize (House Br. 37-39; Cong. Br. \n1-2, 32-33) that the district court’s approval of the 2012 \ninterim plans was “provisional” and not a final determi-\nnation  of whether  they sufficiently  redressed  asserted \nconstitutional  and  VRA  violations  in  the  Legislature’s \n2011 plans.  As already explained (U.S. Br. 38-39, 42-43), \nhowever, that does not preclude application of a strong \npresumption  of  good  faith  to  the  Legislature’s  subse-\nquent incorporation of the court-ordered districts in its \nenactment of the 2013 plans.  A state legislature could \nquite  reasonably  conclude  that  a  federal  court’s  ap-\nproval of an interim map provides, at a minimum, highly \nprobative evidence that the map complies with federal \nlaw.  Indeed, here, the court itself  believed that its in-\nterim  determinations  were  sufficiently  reliable  to  jus-\ntify  use  of  the  at-issue  districts  not  only  for  the  2012 \nelections,  but  for  the  2014  and  2016  elections  as  well.  \nSee U.S. Br. 10-13.   \n\n5  As  plaintiffs  note,  State  House  District  103  was  adjusted  in  \n\nimmaterial respects in 2013.  See House Br. 2.",
        "10 \n\nTo recognize the force of the 2012 interim decisions \nis  not,  as  plaintiffs  suggest,  to  grant  the  State  a  “safe \nharbor” from further liability.  House Br. 37.  The dis-\ntrict  court’s  provisional  approval  of  particular  aspects \nof  the  2011 plans did not preclude  the  court  from ulti-\nmately reaching a contrary final determination regard-\ning  the  2011  plans.    See  University  of  Tex.  v.  Came-\nnisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) (rulings at preliminary-\ninjunction stage “are not binding at trial on the merits”).  \nIn  these  appeals,  however,  the  question  is  not  whether \nthe  legislative  plans  adopted  in  2011  would  ultimately \nhave been found lawful, or whether the court’s 2012 in-\nterim plans would ultimately have been found sufficient \nto  redress  any  violations  in  the  2011  plans,  but  rather \nwhether  the  revised  plans  enacted  by  the  Legislature  in \n2013 were lawful.  And as relevant to plaintiffs’ intentional-\nvote-dilution claims, the question is whether the Legisla-\nture  acted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose  in  enacting \nthose  2013  plans.    That  question  must  be  resolved  by \nlooking to the intent of the 2013 Legislature—an issue \nthat could not have been adjudicated in 2012. \n\nPlaintiffs’  argument  also  overlooks  that  the  2012  in-\nterim  plans  were  the  product  of  the  unique  analytical \nframework  mandated  by  Perry  v.  Perez,  565  U.S.  388 \n(2012) (per curiam).  In Perry, this Court invalidated the \ndistrict court’s prior remedial plans, which had rested on \nthat court’s “own concept of the ‘collective public good,’ ” \nand ordered the court to devise new interim plans for the \n2012 elections that paid appropriate heed to the State’s \npolicy goals.  Id. at 396.  The Court ordered that, as to \nthose  districts  in  the  2011  plans  challenged  under  Sec-\ntion 2 of the VRA or the Fourteenth Amendment, the dis-\ntrict  court  should  retain  those  districts  in  its  interim",
        "11 \n\nplans  unless  plaintiffs  satisfied  the  “likelihood  of  suc-\ncess” preliminary-injunction standard.  Id. at 394.  As to \nchallenges  asserted  under  Section  5  of  the  VRA  in  the \nseparately pending preclearance litigation, however, the \nCourt  established  a  “different,”  more  plaintiff-friendly, \nstandard.  Ibid.  As to those claims, the Court instructed \nthe district court to “tak[e] guidance from [the] State’s \npolicy judgments” only to the extent that the State’s dis-\ntricts “[did not] stand a reasonable probability of failing \nto gain § 5 preclearance.”  Id. at 395.  If a “not insubstan-\ntial”  claim  existed  that  a  challenged  district  “ ‘[]either \nha[d]  the  purpose  []or    * * *    the  effect  of  denying  or \nabridging the right to vote on account of race or color,’ ” \nthe court was required to reject that district rather than \nincorporate it into the interim plan.  Id. at 391 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 1973c(a) (2012)), 395.   \n\nThe  district  court  faithfully  applied  those  standards \non  remand.    It  concluded  that  plaintiffs  had  not  estab-\nlished a likelihood of success on their claims that CD27 \nand  CD35  violated  Section  2  of  the  VRA  or  the  Four-\nteenth  Amendment.    C.J.S.  App.  408a-415a,  417a-423a.  \nThe  court  further  ruled  that  various  congressional  and \nState House districts from the 2011 plans would not be \nincluded in the interim 2012 plans because plaintiffs had \nmet the “low ‘not insubstantial’ standard” applicable to \nSection 5 challenges.  H.J.S. App. 313a; see id. at 305a, \n307a,  312a,  313a;  C.J.S.  App.  397a-408a.    The  court  ex-\nplained with respect to the congressional plan that it had \n“reviewed the post-trial briefing” from the preclearance \nlitigation,  C.J.S.  App.  380a,  and  concluded  that  the  in-\nterim plans sufficiently “resolve[d] the ‘not insubstantial’ \n§  5  claims,”  id.  at  396a.    And  with  respect  to  the  State \nHouse plan, the court stated that “[t]o the extent that le-\ngal challenges are levied against any of th[e] [unchanged",
        "12 \n\nState  House]  districts,  we  preliminarily  find that    * * *  \nany Section 5 challenges are insubstantial.”  H.J.S. App. \n303a.6  The 2013 Legislature was aware that the district \ncourt  in  2012 had  applied  the  framework  established  by \nthis Court’s Perry decision, see, e.g., Texas Br. 35a (legis-\nlative findings), and the court’s announcement that it had \nmade all necessary changes to satisfy that framework fur-\nther underscores the presumptive reasonableness of the \nLegislature’s decision to rely on the court’s orders in en-\nacting permanent redistricting plans.   \n\n3.  Plaintiffs’ remaining arguments rest on inapt legal \nprinciples.  Like the district court (C.J.S. App. 34a-39a), \nplaintiffs place heavy reliance on Hunter v. Underwood, \n471 U.S. 222, 223 (1985), in which this Court invalidated \nan extant provision of the 1901 Alabama Constitution be-\ncause it had been adopted for the purpose of disenfran-\nchising black voters.  Cf. Cong. Br. 30 (asserting Hunter \nto be “indistinguishable”); House Br. 44-45 (similar).  But \nas already explained (U.S. Br. 33-34), Hunter did not in-\nvolve a subsequent legislative enactment, and the Court \n\n6  Among the areas discussed in post-trial briefing in the preclear-\nance  litigation  were  Nueces  County  (containing  CD27,  HD32,  and \nHD34); Bell County (containing HD54 and HD55); and Dallas County \n(containing  HD103,  HD104,  and  HD105).    See,  e.g.,  11-cv-1303 \nDocket entry (Docket entry) No. 207, at 5, 20-22 (Feb. 7, 2012) (chal-\nlenging CD27 as retrogressive); Docket entry No. 206, at 4-5 (Feb. \n17, 2012) (asserting that elimination of HD33 from Nueces County \nwas evidence of intentional discrimination); Docket entry No. 198, \nat 20-21 (Feb. 6, 2012) (asserting that Legislature’s decision to “split \nthe city [of Killeen] between [House] Districts 54 and 55” was “mo-\ntivated  by  intent  to  discriminate  against”  the  “growing  minority \npopulation”); Docket entry No. 195, at 6-7 (Feb. 6, 2012) (asserting \nthat  the  “extremely  contorted  district  boundaries”  of,  inter  alia, \nHD103,  HD104,  and  HD105  reflected  State’s  effort  to  “cancel  out \n[the] minority’s ability to elect”).",
        "13 \n\ncontemplated  that  the  challenged  constitutional  provi-\nsion might have been valid “if enacted today without any \nimpermissible motivation.”  471 U.S. at 233.  That is be-\ncause the determination whether a particular enactment \nwas intentionally discriminatory ultimately turns on the \nintent of the enacting legislature, not that of prior legis-\nlatures. \n\nPlaintiffs  evidence  a  similar  misunderstanding  in \nurging that “repeal and reenactment” of a statute ordi-\nnarily does not change a statute’s meaning or interrupt \nits  effectiveness.    House  Br.  40;  see  Cong.  Br.  29,  31 \nn.17.    Here,  the  question  is  not  how  to  interpret  the \n“substantive  provisions”  of  the  2013  plans  (Cong.  Br. \n29), but whether the Legislature enacted those plans for \nthe purpose of harming minority voters.  Although the \nmeaning of a statute’s text is ordinarily presumed to re-\nmain consistent when reenacted “without change,” Lo-\nrillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978), the law recog-\nnizes no similar presumption or canon that the subjec-\ntive intent of a prior legislature “remains legally opera-\ntive” until some affirmative contrary showing is made, \nJohnson v. Governor, 405 F.3d 1214, 1223 (11th Cir.) (en \nbanc), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1015 (2005).   \n\nPlaintiffs  and  their  amici  also  err  in  relying  on  the \nunique remedial principles governing desegregation of \npublic  schools.    See  House  Br.  46-47;  Common  Cause \nAmicus Br. 28-29; Campaign Legal Ctr. Amicus Br. 4-5, \n17-18.    In  most  contexts,  the  burden  of  proof  rests  on \nthe party alleging a violation of federal law.  Schaffer v. \nWeast, 546 U.S. 49, 56 (2005); see U.S. Br. 26.  In “the \nspecial context of school desegregation cases,” however, \nthis Court concluded that “ ‘fairness’ and ‘policy’ require \nstate  authorities  to  bear  the  burden  of  explaining  ac-",
        "14 \n\ntions  or  conditions  which  appear  to  be  racially  moti-\nvated.”  Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208-\n209  (1973).    That  atypical  “allocation  of  the  burden  of \nproof,” id. at 209, reflects this Court’s earlier judgment \nthat school districts are “charged with [an] affirmative \nduty to take whatever steps might be necessary to con-\nvert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination \nwould be eliminated root and branch,” Green v. County \nSch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437-438 (1968) (emphasis added); \nsee  United  States  v.  Fordice,  505  U.S.  717,  731  (1992) \n(State bore “burden of proving that it has dismantled its \nprior  system.”).    This  Court  has  never  suggested  that \nthe special remedial framework it developed for deseg-\nregation cases should apply to legislative redistricting.  \nTo  the  contrary,  the  Court  has  recognized  that  the \nplaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  proving  intentional  dis-\nin  voting  cases,  see  Bossier  Parish,  \ncrimination \n520 U.S. at 481, and that burden remains on the plaintiff \nin litigation challenging a State’s legislative adoption of \na remedial plan in response to a prior judicial order, see, \ne.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978) (princi-\npal opinion); U.S. Br. 28-29 (citing other authorities). \n\nFinally, plaintiffs are wrong to suggest (Cong. Br. 28) \nthat the district court’s approach is necessary to ensure \nthat legislatures do not engage in opportunistic behavior.  \nThe strong presumption of good faith advocated by the \nUnited  States  applies when  a state  legislature  enacts  a \nplan ordered by a district court after determining that it \nsatisfies (or likely satisfies) constitutional and statutory \nrequirements,  not  any  time  that  a  legislature  “reen-\nact[s]” a statute.  Ibid.  Moreover, our approach does not \ndictate  a  result  as  a  matter  of  law.   If  a plaintiff  shows \nthat  a  legislature  permanently  adopted  a  judicially  ap-\nproved plan not because it legitimately believed that plan",
        "15 \n\nto be lawful, but rather because it sought to preserve dis-\ncrimination  that  somehow  escaped  judicial invalidation, \na plaintiff can succeed in establishing its claim of inten-\ntional vote dilution.  See U.S. Br. 30-31.  A court is not \nrequired  to  “take  at  face  value”  (Cong.  Br.  2)  a  State’s \nassertion that its reenacted plan is lawful.  But plaintiffs \nbear a heavy burden in establishing that a state legisla-\nture’s adoption of a court-ordered plan was intentionally \ndiscriminatory.   \n\nB.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Identified  Facts  Sufficient  To  \n\nRebut The Presumption Of Good Faith   \n\nAs previously explained (U.S. Br. 31-37), it was only by \nrelying on the flawed assumption that discriminatory in-\ntent “carr[ies] over” from one plan to the next, C.J.S. App. \n46a,  unless  and  until  a  State  proves  it  has  “cured  [the] \ntaint,”  id.  at  40a,  that the  district  court  reached its  ulti-\nmate conclusion that the 2013 plans were intentionally dis-\ncriminatory.  The court did not point to any evidence suf-\nficient to rebut the strong presumption of good faith that \napplies  in  these  circumstances.    Nor  do  plaintiffs  make \nany real effort to do so before this Court. \n\nPlaintiffs in  the  congressional  case  consign their re-\nsponse to a single footnote, asserting that “[e]ven were \nthe Court to determine that the proper focus of the ques-\ntions  of  motive, intent,  and purpose  is  the  action  of  the \n2013 Legislature instead of the 2011 Legislature,  * * *  \n[the  district  court’s]  findings  are  not  clearly  erroneous \nand should not be overturned by the Court.”  Cong. Br. \n34 n.20.  The other plaintiffs similarly ask this Court to \nignore the district court’s errors of law by invoking the \n“deferential  clear-error  standard.”    House  Br.  41.    As \nthis Court has long recognized, however, the clear-error \nstandard does not apply to “a finding of fact that is pred-\nicated  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the  governing  rule  of",
        "16 \n\nlaw.”    Bose  Corp.  v.  Consumers  Union  of  U.S.,  Inc., \n466 U.S.  485,  501  (1984);  cf.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1474 \n(“[W]e review a district court’s finding as to racial pre-\ndominance  only  for  clear  error,  except  when  the  court \nmade a legal mistake.”). \n\nInstead  of  identifying  record  evidence  that  demon-\nstrates  discriminatory  intent  by  the  2013  Legislature, \nplaintiffs reiterate the conclusory statements in the dis-\ntrict court’s opinions.  For example, plaintiffs recite that \nthe court “found that the State stuck with its original dis-\ntricts because it ‘intended’ to ‘maintain[]’ the discrimina-\ntory  ‘taint’  that  had  originally  motivated  the  districts.”  \nHouse  Br.  41  (quoting  H.J.S.  App.  359a)  (brackets  in \noriginal).  But the cited page of the court’s decision refers \nto no evidence, and instead expounds upon the court’s le-\ngal premise that the “racially discriminatory intent and \neffects that [the court] previously found in the 2011 plans \ncarry over into the 2013 plans where those district lines \nremain unchanged.”  H.J.S. App. 359a. \n\nSimilarly,  plaintiffs  echo  the  district  court’s  pur-\nported  “f [inding]”  that  the  2013  Legislature  “ ‘did  not \nadopt the Court’s plans with the intent to adopt legally \ncompliant  plans  free  from  discriminatory  taint,  but  as \npart  of  a  litigation  strategy.’ ”    Cong.  Br.  20  (quoting \nC.J.S. App. 40a); see House Br. 19-20, 43.  As noted (U.S. \nBr. 41), a State’s decision to accept a judicially vetted re-\nmedial  plan  presumptively  furthers—not  frustrates—\nCongress’s goals of preventing and redressing unlawful \ndiscrimination.  And plaintiffs point to nothing in the trial \nrecord showing that the State’s “litigation strategy” was \na pernicious one designed to reinforce existing discrimi-\nnation,  as  opposed  to  an  effort  to  enact  a  lawful  redis-\ntricting plan.  Plaintiffs’ assertion that “Texas wanted to \nbring  this  litigation  to  an  end  in  order  to  keep in place",
        "17 \n\nthe  districts  its  Legislature  had  drawn  in  2011  for  dis-\ncriminatory reasons,” House Br. 45 (emphasis omitted), \nappears to rest only on speculation, not on evidence.  \n\nPlaintiffs  also  posit  that  the  district  court  “heard \nTexas’s  witnesses  [and]  found  their  proffered  explana-\ntions pretextual.”  House Br. 41 (citing H.J.S. App. 345a-\n346a, 348a, 353a-359a); cf. C.J.S. App. 32a-46a (contain-\ning same passages).  But the cited pages do not reference \nany testimony that the court found “pretextual” or oth-\nerwise not credible.  Instead, those pages contain discus-\nsion  articulating  the  court’s  legal  theory,  H.J.S.  App. \n345a-348a,  and  explaining  its  conclusion  that  the  2013 \nLegislature failed to “engage in a deliberative process to \nensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 \nplans,” id. at 353a; see id. at 353a-359a.  The sole witness \nfor the State whose testimony the court described at any \nlength was Jeff Archer, the Legislature’s chief counsel.  \nSee H.J.S. App. 356a-358a & nn.43, 45; C.J.S. App. 43a-\n45a & nn.43, 45.  But the court credited that testimony:  \nArcher  testified,  and  the  court  agreed,  that  the  2013 \nLegislature  was  aware  that  the  interim  plans  were \nbased on provisional rulings rather than “final determi-\nnations,”  C.J.S.  App.  43a,  and  that  enacting  the  2013 \nplans  would  likely  not  moot  the  litigation  because \n“Plaintiffs  would  pursue  claims  against  the  interim \nmaps,” id. at 44a n.45.   \n\nIt is true that the 2013 plans were enacted by “a sub-\nstantially similar Legislature with the same leadership” \nas existed in 2011.  House Br. 46 (quoting H.J.S. App. \n352a n.37).  Contrary to plaintiffs’ assumption, however, \na court is not “entitled to infer” (ibid.) that a later leg-\nislature has acted with discriminatory intent solely be-\ncause  a  prior  legislature  was  found  to  have  done  so.  \n“[P]ast discrimination cannot, in the manner of original",
        "18 \n\nsin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlaw-\nful.”    City  of  Mobile  v.  Bolden,  446  U.S.  55,  74  (1980) \n(plurality opinion).  If the existence of past misconduct \nwere  sufficient,  standing  alone,  to  sustain  a  finding  of \npresent misconduct, the presumption of legislative good \nfaith would have no meaning.  U.S. Br. 28. \n\nPlaintiffs  suggest  that  the  Legislature  enacted  the \n2013 plans “with no discussion or debate over concerns \nraised by minority legislators.”  House Br. 46.  Plaintiffs \ndo not identify evidence in the trial record that they be-\nlieve supports that observation.  In any event, plaintiffs \nfail  to  explain  why  the  appropriate  inference  to  be \ndrawn  from  the  Legislature’s  adoption  of  the  interim \nplans largely without amendment was that the Legisla-\nture was motivated by intentional discrimination, as op-\nposed  to  an  interest  in  enacting  lawful  plans  likely  to \nsurvive further challenge.  Indeed, the Legislature may \nhave been concerned that if it engaged in race-conscious \nrevisions of the interim plans, it could later face claims \nthat it engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering \nby drawing majority-minority districts that the court it-\nself had previously determined were likely not required \nby the VRA.  Cf. id. at 52 (arguing that legislative revi-\nsions to HD90 in 2013 caused it to become a “deliberate \nracial gerrymander”). \n\nFinally,  plaintiffs  seek  to  treat  as  evidence  of  dis-\ncrimination the fact that the challenged districts in the \n2013 plans were “exactly the same” as the correspond-\ning districts in the 2011 plans.  House Br. 46; see Cong. \nBr. 1, 18, 24, 28.  But those districts were identical pre-\ncisely  because  the  district  court,  consistent  with  this \nCourt’s directives in Perry, had allowed their continued \nuse  in  2012  after  finding  that  plaintiffs’  challenges  to",
        "19 \n\nthose districts were unlikely to succeed or were insub-\nstantial.  The very facts that render a legislative action \nentitled to the strong presumption of good faith cannot \nsimultaneously rebut that presumption. \n\nIII.  CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT \n\n35 \n\nIS  NOT  AN  \n\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL RACIAL GERRYMANDER  \nA.  The  district  court  also  erred  in  concluding  that \nCD35  was  an  unconstitutional  racial  gerrymander.    See \nU.S. Br. 44-48.  As an initial matter, the circumstances of \nthe Legislature’s action indicate that race did not predom-\ninate  in  CD35’s  enactment  in  2013  because  the  Legisla-\nture enacted the 2013 congressional plan so that all of its \ndistricts would match precisely the districts provisionally \nfound to be lawful in 2012.  Cf. Texas Br. 34a-36a (text of \n2013 enactment “adopt[ing]” court’s interim redistricting \nplan “as the [State’s] permanent plan”).   \n\nIn any event, CD35 would survive strict scrutiny be-\ncause  the  State  had  “good  reasons”  to  believe  that  the \nVRA required it to draw CD35 in 2011 and to maintain it \nin 2013.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation omitted).  In-\ndeed,  in  2011,  a  subset  of  plaintiffs  proposed  and  sup-\nported the creation of CD35 as “an appropriate § 2” La-\ntino opportunity district.  C.J.S. App. 174a.  And in 2012, \nthe  district  court  itself  provisionally  concluded  that \nCD35  was  a  valid  Section  2  district.    Id.  at  409a-415a.  \nThose considerations provided, at a minimum, sufficient \n“breathing room” for the State to reasonably conclude in \n2013  that  CD35  addressed  a  VRA  need  and  that  main-\ntaining it would not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation omitted). \n\nB.  Plaintiffs’ responses identify no sound basis for con-\ncluding otherwise.  Plaintiffs assert that the district court \nwas correct to find racial predominance because “nearly",
        "20 \n\nevery traditional districting principle in CD35 was subor-\ndinated to race.”  Cong. Br. 36.  But that argument improp-\nerly focuses on 2011, when CD35 was first drawn, rather \nthan on 2013, when the operative congressional plan was \nenacted  in  accordance  with  the  district  boundaries  that \nthe court provisionally found lawful in 2012.   \n\nPlaintiffs’ discussion of strict scrutiny repeats the dis-\ntrict  court’s  errors.    Plaintiffs  note  that  “[t]he  district \ncourt found  * * *  that ‘the third Gingles precondition is \nnot  present  in  a  significant  portion  of  the  district’ ”  be-\ncause  “Travis  County  Anglos  lack  cohesion  and  split \ntheir  vote.”    Cong.  Br.  38  (citation  omitted);  cf.  Thorn-\nburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 51 (1986) (requiring that the \n“majority  votes  sufficiently  as  a  bloc  to  enable  it    * * *  \nusually  to  defeat  the  minority’s  preferred  candidate”).  \nBut as this Court has explained, “the basic unit of analysis \nfor racial gerrymandering claims  * * *  is the district,” \nand a court should not focus on “particular portions [of \nthe district] in isolation.”  Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 800.  \nThe district court here failed to address whether voting \npatterns were racially polarized across CD35 as a whole.  \nAnd  had  it  performed  the  required  “holistic  analysis,” \nibid.,  the  court  necessarily  would  have  concluded  that  \nracially polarized voting existed in CD35.  See U.S. Br. \n47-48. \n\nPlaintiffs  also theorize  (Cong.  Br.  39) that the  State \ncannot “seek refuge in § 2” because the creation of CD35 \nwas  not  contemporaneously  “informed  by”  an  “inquiry \ninto § 2 requirements.”  But as already noted, a group of \nplaintiffs  themselves  urged  the  Legislature  to  draw \nCD35 in 2011 precisely because they believed the district \nto be required by Section 2.  See C.J.S. App. 174a; C.J.S. \nSupp. App. 152a, 158a, 315a-317a, 319a-320a.  All agreed \nin  2011  that  at  least  seven  Latino  opportunity  districts",
        "21 \n\nneeded to be drawn in South and West Texas in order to \ncomply with the VRA, see C.J.S. App. 112a & n.85, 126a-\n127a,  176a,  and  CD35  extended  within  that  region.  \nMoreover,  this  Court’s  racial-gerrymandering  prece-\ndents do not require a State, in drawing a Section 2 dis-\ntrict, to develop the full factual record that it could later \nmarshal in subsequent litigation.  To survive strict scru-\ntiny,  it  suffices  that  the  State’s  “actual  purpose”  was \ncompliance with the VRA and that it had a “strong basis \nin evidence to support that justification,” even if that ba-\nsis in evidence was not contemporaneously memorialized \nin exhaustive detail.  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908 n.4 \n(1996).  And when the Legislature enacted the 2013 plan \ncontaining CD35, the district court’s 2012 decision itself \nfurnished a strong basis in evidence.   \n\nFinally, plaintiffs suggest that CD35 cannot survive \nstrict  scrutiny  because  the  Legislature’s  “ ‘actual  pur-\npose’ ” in drawing CD35 was to “dismantle[] the existing \ncrossover district there” (i.e., former CD25).  Cong. Br. \n39  (citation  omitted);  cf.  U.S.  Br.  10  n.5  (defining \n“ ‘crossover’  district”).    But  the  district  court  made  no \nsuch  finding.    Indeed,  plaintiffs  sought  to  press  the \nsame argument about CD25 as a freestanding claim of \nintentional  racial  discrimination,  but  the  district  court \nexpressly declined to reach that claim.  See C.J.S. App. \n111a  n.83,  172a  n.38.    And  when  the  court  earlier  ad-\ndressed  that  claim  in  the  context  of  the  2012  interim \nplans, it was “unable to conclude” that the “dismantling \nof CD 25 was motivated by a discriminatory purpose as \nopposed to partisan politics.”  Id. at 415a.7  Plaintiffs thus \n\n7  The United States argued in the preclearance litigation that CD25 \nwas not a “protected crossover district” and that its dismantlement \ntherefore was not unlawful.

Instead  of  asking \nwhether  plaintiffs  had  proven  that  the  2013  Legislature \nenacted the 2013 plans for the purpose of harming minor-\nity  voters,  the  court  presumed  that  discriminatory  mo-\ntives of a prior legislature would “carry over” to invalidate \nfuture  legislative  action—the  substance  of  which  that \nsame  court  had  already  provisionally  approved—unless \nthe State established it had affirmatively “removed” the \n“taint” of prior discrimination.  C.J.S. App. 46a.  As our \nopening brief explains, that notion of persistent discrimi-\nnatory intent is directly contrary to the strong presump-\ntion of good faith that should apply when a State adopts \nremedial plans that a court has reviewed and, after adver-\nsarial testing, provisionally found to be lawful.   \n\nThe district court’s treatment of Congressional Dis-\ntrict  35  (CD35)  similarly  rested  on  flawed  legal  prem-\n\n(1) \n\n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nises.    Because  racial-gerrymandering  claims  are  ad-\ndressed “holistic[ally]” at the “district” level, Bethune-\nHill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, \n800  (2017),  the  absence  of  racially  polarized  voting  in \nTravis County—part of which constitutes, in turn, part \nof CD35—does not demonstrate that the 2013 Legisla-\nture lacked a sound basis to conclude that CD35 satis-\nfied Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act (VRA).  On the \ncontrary, the court’s own 2012 decision provisionally re-\njecting plaintiffs’ claims was itself sufficient to give the \nState “good reasons” to believe in 2013 that CD35 was \nlawful.    Id.  at  795.    Plaintiffs’  arguments  do  not  show \notherwise. \n\nI.  THIS  COURT  MAY  EXERCISE  JURISDICTION  OVER \n\nTHESE APPEALS   \nA.  Under 28 U.S.C. 1253, this Court possesses appel-\nlate  jurisdiction over  orders granting  or  denying  inter-\nlocutory or permanent injunctions in three-judge district \ncourt actions brought under 28 U.S.C. 2284(a).  As previ-\nously explained (U.S. Br. 20-23),1 the district court’s Au-\ngust 15 and August 24, 2017 orders are properly under-\nstood to have enjoined future use of the State’s 2013 con-\ngressional  and  State  House  plans  and  are  therefore  \nappealable. \n\n1  “U.S.  Br.”  refers  to  the  United  States’  opening  brief;  “Texas \nBr.” refers to Appellants’ opening brief; “Cong. Br.” refers to plain-\ntiffs’ response brief in No. 17-586; and “House Br.” refers to plain-\ntiffs’  response  brief  in  No.  17-626.    See  U.S.  Br.  1  n.1  (explaining \nother abbreviations). \n\n \n \n                                                      \n\f3 \n\nAs noted by plaintiffs (Cong. Br. 26), the district court \ndid not expressly style its orders as injunctions.2  But that \nconsideration is not dispositive.  As this Court held in in-\nterpreting 28 U.S.C. 1292(a)(1)—an analogous statute al-\nlowing  for  immediate  appellate  review  of  injunctions—\neven an order not styled as the grant or denial of an in-\njunction  is  nonetheless  appealable  if  the  order  has  the \n“practical effect” of granting or denying injunctive relief; \n“might  have  a  ‘serious,  perhaps  irreparable,  conse-\nquence’ ”;  and  “can  be  ‘effectually  challenged’  only  by \nimmediate appeal.”  Carson v. American Brands, Inc., \n450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981) (citation omitted).   \n\nThe district court’s orders meet those standards.  See \nU.S. Br. 20-23.  The court found that the 2013 congres-\nsional  and  State  House  plans  contained  “statutory  and \nconstitutional violations” that “must be remedied by ei-\nther  the  Texas  Legislature  or  this  Court.”   C.J.S.  App. \n118a; H.J.S. App. 84a-85a (similar).  The court then gave \nthe  Governor  only  three  days  to  decide  whether  to  call \nthe  Legislature into  special session  to  enact  new redis-\ntricting plans, or instead leave the drawing of new maps \nto the court in highly expedited proceedings.  Those rul-\nings left little doubt that Texas would be forbidden from \nusing its 2013 plans for the 2018 elections.  Had the State \nbeen required to wait until the court entered an express \ninjunction, that order would likely have come too late for \n\n2  Several  plaintiffs  had  requested  immediate  injunctive  relief.  \nSee,  e.g.,  D.  Ct.  Doc.  1525,  at  42  (July  31,  2017)  (plaintiff  MALC) \n(“[T]he  plans  containing  these  defects  must  be  enjoined  and  their \ndefects must be remedied.”); D. Ct. Doc. 1527-1, at 2 (July 31, 2017) \n(Quesada  plaintiffs)  (“The  Court  should  enter  judgment  perma-\nnently enjoining further use of Plan C235.”); D. Ct. Doc. 1529-1, at 1 \n(July 31, 2017) (NAACP plaintiff-intervenors) (“If [the court] finds \nthat such unconstitutional intent existed, it must enter an immedi-\nate and permanent injunction.”). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f4 \n\nappellate  review  before  deadlines  associated  with  the \n2018 election cycle.  Under these unusual circumstances, \na  State  whose  existing  legislative  apportionment  plans \nare invalidated in litigation under 28 U.S.C. 2284(a), and \nwhose Governor is given such an ultimatum concerning \nthe State’s legislative process, need not await entry of an \nexpress  injunction  before  obtaining  appellate  review  of \nthe district court’s order.  \n\nB.  1.  Plaintiffs fail to explain why the district court’s \norders do not satisfy Carson’s elements.  They instead ar-\ngue (Cong. Br. 26; House Br. 30) that Carson is inapposite \nto Section 1253.  But Section 1253 contains language ma-\nterially similar to that of Section 1292(a)(1), and plaintiffs \noffer no sound reason why the two statutes should not be \ninterpreted consistently.  Compare 28 U.S.C. 1253 (allow-\ning “appeal  * * *  from an order granting or denying  * * *  \nan interlocutory or permanent injunction”), with 28 U.S.C. \n1292(a)(1) (allowing “appeal[] from  * * *  [i]nterlocutory \norders    * * *    granting,    * * *    refusing  or  dissolving  \ninjunctions”). \n\nIn  opposing  Carson’s  application,  plaintiffs  urge  that \nSection 1253 “is to be narrowly construed.”  House Br. 29 \n(quoting Goldstein v. Cox, 396 U.S. 471, 478 (1970)).  But \nCarson said the same about Section 1292(a)(1).  See Car-\nson, 450 U.S. at 84 (“Because § 1292(a)(1) was intended to \ncarve  out  only  a  limited  exception  to  the  final-judgment \nrule, we have construed the statute narrowly.”); cf. Swit-\nzerland Cheese Ass’n v. E. Horne’s Mkt., Inc., 385 U.S. 23, \n24 (1966) (similar).  And plaintiffs’ assertion (House Br. \n30) that this Court “squarely refused to create a ‘practi-\ncal effect’ exception” in Gunn v. University Committee \nTo End The War In Viet Nam, 399 U.S. 383 (1970) and \nGoldstein  v.  Cox,  supra,  overlooks  that  those  decisions \n\n \n\f5 \n\npredated  Carson  and  that  in  neither did the Court dis-\ncuss and reject a practical-effect test.3 \n\nPlaintiffs also suggest (Cong. Br. 27) that the Carson \nframework should apply only when an injunction is effec-\ntively denied, and not when one is effectively granted.  But \nthis Court has stated that Section 1292(a)(1) “provide[s] \nappellate  jurisdiction  over  orders  that    *  *  *    have  the \npractical  effect  of  granting  or  denying  injunctions  and \nhave ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, consequence.’ ”  Gulf-\nstream  Aerospace  Corp.  v.  Mayacamas  Corp.,  485  U.S. \n271, 287-288 (1988) (emphasis added; citation omitted). \n\nAn order granting an injunction is, of course, subject \nto procedural requirements under Federal Rule of Civil \nProcedure 65(d) that do not apply to denials of injunc-\ntions.   See  Gunn,  399 U.S.  at  388.   But  this Court  has \nrecognized  that  an order  may  amount to  an  injunction \nunder 28 U.S.C. 1253 even if it fails to comply with the \nFederal Rules of Civil Procedure.  See Schmidt v. Les-\nsard, 414 U.S. 473, 477 (1974) (per curiam).  Moreover, \nwhatever the precise contours of the “remedy” the dis-\ntrict court might ultimately have entered (Cong. Br. 27), \nit was clear from the court’s orders that the State’s ex-\nisting maps could not be used.  And this Court has re-\nviewed  injunctions  barring  use  of  existing  apportion-\nment plans even though replacement plans had not yet \n\n3  In Goldstein, the plaintiffs sought to appeal the district court’s \ndenial  of  their  summary-judgment  motion.    Although  their  com-\nplaint had “pray[ed] for preliminary as well as permanent injunctive \nrelief,” the plaintiffs had “t[aken] no practical step toward obtaining \nsuch relief,” and the court’s order thus did not constitute the denial \nof  an  injunction.    396  U.S.  at  478-479.    In  Gunn,  the  defendants \nsought to appeal an interlocutory order concluding that a state stat-\nute was unconstitutional.  But the defendants there acknowledged \nthat the order was “no more than ‘an advisory opinion’ ” inasmuch \nas no injunction had yet been entered.  399 U.S. at 389. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f6 \n\nbeen drawn.  See, e.g., Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455 \n(2017);  Sixty-Seventh  Minn.  State  Senate  v.  Beens,  \n406 U.S. 187, 190-191, 194-195 (1972) (per curiam). \n\nPlaintiffs  fault  the  United  States  (House  Br.  32)  for \nfailing to distill the Carson framework to a simpler rule \nthat would better “guide future litigants” in assessing ap-\npealability.  But Carson requires consideration of whether \nthe order will have a “ ‘serious, perhaps irreparable, con-\nsequence’ ” and whether it “can be ‘effectually challenged’ \nonly by immediate appeal.”  450 U.S. at 84 (citation omit-\nted).  Those determinations require case-specific analy-\nsis,  including  consideration  of  real-world  deadlines  or \nother  exigencies  confronting  the  appellant.    See,  e.g., \nStovall v. City of Cocoa, 117 F.3d 1238, 1241 (11th Cir. \n1997) (court’s effective denial of injunction was immedi-\nately appealable because “trial in the district court [may \nnot] conclude in time to affect the next election”).  \n\n2.  Plaintiffs  also  err  in  suggesting  (House  Br.  32  & \nn.12) that the circumstances here are “nearly identical” \nto those of Whitcomb v. Chavis, 403 U.S. 124 (1971).  In \nWhitcomb,  the  plaintiffs  filed  suit  in  January  1969;  the \ndistrict  court  issued  its  liability  determination  in  late \nJuly 1969; and that court “ga[ve] the State until October 1, \n1969”—several months later—“to enact legislation rem-\nedying” the violations.  Id. at 131, 137-138.  When the leg-\nislature opted not to act, the court entered its injunctive \norders  in December  1969.   See  id.  at  139;  307  F.  Supp. \n1362  (S.D.  Ind.  1969);  see  also  396  U.S.  1055  (1970) \n(granting  stay);  397  U.S.  984  (1970)  (noting  probable  \njurisdiction).   \n\nThe  chronology  here  was  very  different.    Although \nplaintiffs  promptly  brought  their  relevant  claims  in \n2013, the district court declined to adjudicate them im-\nmediately.  It instead allowed the 2013 plans to be used—\n\n \n\f7 \n\nover  plaintiffs’  repeated  objections—for  both  the  2014 \nand 2016 elections.  And in August 2017, when the court \nultimately found the 2013 plans to be invalid, it gave the \nGovernor just three days to decide whether to pursue en-\nactment  of  a  legislative  plan.    C.J.S.  App.  118a;  H.J.S. \nApp. 86a.  It simultaneously scheduled judicial remedial \nhearings for September 5 and 6, 2017—mere weeks be-\nfore  the  State’s  October  1,  2017  deadline  for  finalizing \ndistricts for the 2018 election cycle, and likely too close \nto  that  deadline  to  afford  adequate  time  for  appellate \nreview.  Ibid.4   \n\nII.  PLAINTIFFS  HAVE  FAILED  TO  ESTABLISH  THAT \nTHE 2013 LEGISLATURE ENGAGED IN INTENTIONAL \nVOTE DILUTION  \n\nA.  Plaintiffs Bear The Heavy Burden Of Proving That The \n2013  Legislature  Acted  With  A  Discriminatory  Racial \nPurpose  In  Permanently  Adopting  The  2012  Court- \nOrdered Interim Plans   \n\n1.  As explained in our opening brief (at 24-29), a leg-\nislative redistricting plan may be invalidated on grounds \nof intentional vote dilution only if a plaintiff shows that \nthe  legislature  adopted  that  plan  for  a  discriminatory \npurpose.  In analyzing such a claim, a court must accord \na “presumption of good faith [to] legislative enactments,” \nHunt  v.  Cromartie,  526  U.S.  541,  553  (1999)  (citation \n\n4  Both plaintiffs and the district court acknowledged  the signifi-\ncance of the October 1, 2017 deadline for the timing of further liti-\ngation.  See, e.g., D. Ct. Doc. 1389, at 1 (May 1, 2017) (“The Court is \naware of the condensed schedule that must be implemented in light \nof  the  2018  election  deadlines.”);  D.  Ct.  Doc.  1372,  at  3  (Apr.  24, \n2017)  (NAACP  plaintiffs)  (requesting  expeditious  resolution  be-\ncause “[t]he first steps in the 2018 election process begin early this \nfall”); D. Ct. Doc. 1375, at 2 (Apr. 24, 2017) (African-American Con-\ngressperson plaintiffs) (similar). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f8 \n\nomitted), and the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff, \nsee  Reno  v. Bossier  Parish  Sch. Bd.,  520  U.S.  471,  481 \n(1997).  Moreover, although an enactment’s “impact” and \n“historical  background”  are  both  relevant,  Village  of  \nArlington  Heights  v.  Metropolitan  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  \n429  U.S.  252,  266-267 (1977),  courts  must not  infer  dis-\ncriminatory intent solely from disparate effects, see U.S. \nBr. 27-28, and a finding of past intentional discrimination \nalone  ordinarily  cannot  sustain  an  inference  of  present \ndiscrimination, see id. at 28.   \n\nAs also explained (U.S. Br. 29-31), this Court’s cases \nsuggest the further principle that a court should afford \nparticular weight in the discriminatory-purpose assess-\nment to a state legislature’s enactment undertaken in re-\nliance on a court-ordered remedial plan.  When a court \nhas found in a reasoned decision that a court-ordered in-\nterim redistricting plan redresses all likely violations of \nlaw,  and  when  the  legislature  permanently  adopts  that \nplan to replace its original enactment, the normal pre-\nsumption  of  good  faith  accorded  to  legislative  enact-\nments is heightened by the State’s acceptance of the ju-\ndicially approved plan.  It is appropriate for plaintiffs to \nbear a heavy burden in establishing that a state legisla-\nture’s  adoption  of  a  court-ordered  plan  was  intention-\nally discriminatory.  \n\n2.  Plaintiffs’ response briefs do not dispute that the \ndistrict court’s legal analysis was inconsistent with the \nforegoing  principles.    Plaintiffs  instead  argue  (House \nBr. 35-40; Cong. Br. 27-34) that those principles should \nnot be applied in this particular case.  Those arguments \nare unpersuasive. \n\nPlaintiffs’ chief submission is that the principles set \nforth  in  our  opening  brief  are  irrelevant  because  this \ncase  does  not  involve  a  “court-drawn”  or  “judicial[ly]” \n\n \n\f9 \n\ncreated plan.  House Br. 1, 19, 27, 39-40; see Cong. Br. \n1,  24.   Plaintiffs emphasize  that  most  districts at  issue \nhere were first drawn in the State’s 2011 legislative plans, \nnot in the 2012 interim plans.5  But our argument rests on \nthe fact that the interim plans were “judicially approved” \nand “court-ordered” (U.S. Br. 18, 30), not on the mistaken \nunderstanding  that  the  districts  were  “court-drawn”  in \nthe first instance.  What matters is that the court evalu-\nated  the  particular  plans  at  issue;  provisionally  found \nthem to be lawful; and ordered their use for future elec-\ntions.  Once a court has made such determinations, it is \nappropriate  to  presume  that  a  state  legislature  acts  in \ngood  faith  if  it  then  adopts  the  judicially  approved  dis-\ntricts in permanent redistricting plans.   \n\nPlaintiffs also emphasize (House Br. 37-39; Cong. Br. \n1-2, 32-33) that the district court’s approval of the 2012 \ninterim plans was “provisional” and not a final determi-\nnation  of whether  they sufficiently  redressed  asserted \nconstitutional  and  VRA  violations  in  the  Legislature’s \n2011 plans.  As already explained (U.S. Br. 38-39, 42-43), \nhowever, that does not preclude application of a strong \npresumption  of  good  faith  to  the  Legislature’s  subse-\nquent incorporation of the court-ordered districts in its \nenactment of the 2013 plans.  A state legislature could \nquite  reasonably  conclude  that  a  federal  court’s  ap-\nproval of an interim map provides, at a minimum, highly \nprobative evidence that the map complies with federal \nlaw.  Indeed, here, the court itself  believed that its in-\nterim  determinations  were  sufficiently  reliable  to  jus-\ntify  use  of  the  at-issue  districts  not  only  for  the  2012 \nelections,  but  for  the  2014  and  2016  elections  as  well.  \nSee U.S. Br. 10-13.   \n\n5  As  plaintiffs  note,  State  House  District  103  was  adjusted  in  \n\nimmaterial respects in 2013.  See House Br. 2. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f10 \n\nTo recognize the force of the 2012 interim decisions \nis  not,  as  plaintiffs  suggest,  to  grant  the  State  a  “safe \nharbor” from further liability.  House Br. 37.  The dis-\ntrict  court’s  provisional  approval  of  particular  aspects \nof  the  2011 plans did not preclude  the  court  from ulti-\nmately reaching a contrary final determination regard-\ning  the  2011  plans.    See  University  of  Tex.  v.  Came-\nnisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) (rulings at preliminary-\ninjunction stage “are not binding at trial on the merits”).  \nIn  these  appeals,  however,  the  question  is  not  whether \nthe  legislative  plans  adopted  in  2011  would  ultimately \nhave been found lawful, or whether the court’s 2012 in-\nterim plans would ultimately have been found sufficient \nto  redress  any  violations  in  the  2011  plans,  but  rather \nwhether  the  revised  plans  enacted  by  the  Legislature  in \n2013 were lawful.  And as relevant to plaintiffs’ intentional-\nvote-dilution claims, the question is whether the Legisla-\nture  acted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose  in  enacting \nthose  2013  plans.    That  question  must  be  resolved  by \nlooking to the intent of the 2013 Legislature—an issue \nthat could not have been adjudicated in 2012. \n\nPlaintiffs’  argument  also  overlooks  that  the  2012  in-\nterim  plans  were  the  product  of  the  unique  analytical \nframework  mandated  by  Perry  v.  Perez,  565  U.S.  388 \n(2012) (per curiam).  In Perry, this Court invalidated the \ndistrict court’s prior remedial plans, which had rested on \nthat court’s “own concept of the ‘collective public good,’ ” \nand ordered the court to devise new interim plans for the \n2012 elections that paid appropriate heed to the State’s \npolicy goals.  Id. at 396.  The Court ordered that, as to \nthose  districts  in  the  2011  plans  challenged  under  Sec-\ntion 2 of the VRA or the Fourteenth Amendment, the dis-\ntrict  court  should  retain  those  districts  in  its  interim \n\n \n\f11 \n\nplans  unless  plaintiffs  satisfied  the  “likelihood  of  suc-\ncess” preliminary-injunction standard.  Id. at 394.  As to \nchallenges  asserted  under  Section  5  of  the  VRA  in  the \nseparately pending preclearance litigation, however, the \nCourt  established  a  “different,”  more  plaintiff-friendly, \nstandard.  Ibid.  As to those claims, the Court instructed \nthe district court to “tak[e] guidance from [the] State’s \npolicy judgments” only to the extent that the State’s dis-\ntricts “[did not] stand a reasonable probability of failing \nto gain § 5 preclearance.”  Id. at 395.  If a “not insubstan-\ntial”  claim  existed  that  a  challenged  district  “ ‘[]either \nha[d]  the  purpose  []or    * * *    the  effect  of  denying  or \nabridging the right to vote on account of race or color,’ ” \nthe court was required to reject that district rather than \nincorporate it into the interim plan.  Id. at 391 (quoting \n42 U.S.C. 1973c(a) (2012)), 395.   \n\nThe  district  court  faithfully  applied  those  standards \non  remand.    It  concluded  that  plaintiffs  had  not  estab-\nlished a likelihood of success on their claims that CD27 \nand  CD35  violated  Section  2  of  the  VRA  or  the  Four-\nteenth  Amendment.    C.J.S.  App.  408a-415a,  417a-423a.  \nThe  court  further  ruled  that  various  congressional  and \nState House districts from the 2011 plans would not be \nincluded in the interim 2012 plans because plaintiffs had \nmet the “low ‘not insubstantial’ standard” applicable to \nSection 5 challenges.  H.J.S. App. 313a; see id. at 305a, \n307a,  312a,  313a;  C.J.S.  App.  397a-408a.    The  court  ex-\nplained with respect to the congressional plan that it had \n“reviewed the post-trial briefing” from the preclearance \nlitigation,  C.J.S.  App.  380a,  and  concluded  that  the  in-\nterim plans sufficiently “resolve[d] the ‘not insubstantial’ \n§  5  claims,”  id.  at  396a.    And  with  respect  to  the  State \nHouse plan, the court stated that “[t]o the extent that le-\ngal challenges are levied against any of th[e] [unchanged \n\n \n\f12 \n\nState  House]  districts,  we  preliminarily  find that    * * *  \nany Section 5 challenges are insubstantial.”  H.J.S. App. \n303a.6  The 2013 Legislature was aware that the district \ncourt  in  2012 had  applied  the  framework  established  by \nthis Court’s Perry decision, see, e.g., Texas Br. 35a (legis-\nlative findings), and the court’s announcement that it had \nmade all necessary changes to satisfy that framework fur-\nther underscores the presumptive reasonableness of the \nLegislature’s decision to rely on the court’s orders in en-\nacting permanent redistricting plans.   \n\n3.  Plaintiffs’ remaining arguments rest on inapt legal \nprinciples.  Like the district court (C.J.S. App. 34a-39a), \nplaintiffs place heavy reliance on Hunter v. Underwood, \n471 U.S. 222, 223 (1985), in which this Court invalidated \nan extant provision of the 1901 Alabama Constitution be-\ncause it had been adopted for the purpose of disenfran-\nchising black voters.  Cf. Cong. Br. 30 (asserting Hunter \nto be “indistinguishable”); House Br. 44-45 (similar).  But \nas already explained (U.S. Br. 33-34), Hunter did not in-\nvolve a subsequent legislative enactment, and the Court \n\n6  Among the areas discussed in post-trial briefing in the preclear-\nance  litigation  were  Nueces  County  (containing  CD27,  HD32,  and \nHD34); Bell County (containing HD54 and HD55); and Dallas County \n(containing  HD103,  HD104,  and  HD105).    See,  e.g.,  11-cv-1303 \nDocket entry (Docket entry) No. 207, at 5, 20-22 (Feb. 7, 2012) (chal-\nlenging CD27 as retrogressive); Docket entry No. 206, at 4-5 (Feb. \n17, 2012) (asserting that elimination of HD33 from Nueces County \nwas evidence of intentional discrimination); Docket entry No. 198, \nat 20-21 (Feb. 6, 2012) (asserting that Legislature’s decision to “split \nthe city [of Killeen] between [House] Districts 54 and 55” was “mo-\ntivated  by  intent  to  discriminate  against”  the  “growing  minority \npopulation”); Docket entry No. 195, at 6-7 (Feb. 6, 2012) (asserting \nthat  the  “extremely  contorted  district  boundaries”  of,  inter  alia, \nHD103,  HD104,  and  HD105  reflected  State’s  effort  to  “cancel  out \n[the] minority’s ability to elect”).  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f13 \n\ncontemplated  that  the  challenged  constitutional  provi-\nsion might have been valid “if enacted today without any \nimpermissible motivation.”  471 U.S. at 233.  That is be-\ncause the determination whether a particular enactment \nwas intentionally discriminatory ultimately turns on the \nintent of the enacting legislature, not that of prior legis-\nlatures. \n\nPlaintiffs  evidence  a  similar  misunderstanding  in \nurging that “repeal and reenactment” of a statute ordi-\nnarily does not change a statute’s meaning or interrupt \nits  effectiveness.    House  Br.  40;  see  Cong.  Br.  29,  31 \nn.17.    Here,  the  question  is  not  how  to  interpret  the \n“substantive  provisions”  of  the  2013  plans  (Cong.  Br. \n29), but whether the Legislature enacted those plans for \nthe purpose of harming minority voters.  Although the \nmeaning of a statute’s text is ordinarily presumed to re-\nmain consistent when reenacted “without change,” Lo-\nrillard v. Pons, 434 U.S. 575, 580 (1978), the law recog-\nnizes no similar presumption or canon that the subjec-\ntive intent of a prior legislature “remains legally opera-\ntive” until some affirmative contrary showing is made, \nJohnson v. Governor, 405 F.3d 1214, 1223 (11th Cir.) (en \nbanc), cert. denied, 546 U.S. 1015 (2005).   \n\nPlaintiffs  and  their  amici  also  err  in  relying  on  the \nunique remedial principles governing desegregation of \npublic  schools.    See  House  Br.  46-47;  Common  Cause \nAmicus Br. 28-29; Campaign Legal Ctr. Amicus Br. 4-5, \n17-18.    In  most  contexts,  the  burden  of  proof  rests  on \nthe party alleging a violation of federal law.  Schaffer v. \nWeast, 546 U.S. 49, 56 (2005); see U.S. Br. 26.  In “the \nspecial context of school desegregation cases,” however, \nthis Court concluded that “ ‘fairness’ and ‘policy’ require \nstate  authorities  to  bear  the  burden  of  explaining  ac-\n\n \n\f14 \n\ntions  or  conditions  which  appear  to  be  racially  moti-\nvated.”  Keyes v. School Dist. No. 1, 413 U.S. 189, 208-\n209  (1973).    That  atypical  “allocation  of  the  burden  of \nproof,” id. at 209, reflects this Court’s earlier judgment \nthat school districts are “charged with [an] affirmative \nduty to take whatever steps might be necessary to con-\nvert to a unitary system in which racial discrimination \nwould be eliminated root and branch,” Green v. County \nSch. Bd., 391 U.S. 430, 437-438 (1968) (emphasis added); \nsee  United  States  v.  Fordice,  505  U.S.  717,  731  (1992) \n(State bore “burden of proving that it has dismantled its \nprior  system.”).    This  Court  has  never  suggested  that \nthe special remedial framework it developed for deseg-\nregation cases should apply to legislative redistricting.  \nTo  the  contrary,  the  Court  has  recognized  that  the \nplaintiff  bears  the  burden  of  proving  intentional  dis-\nin  voting  cases,  see  Bossier  Parish,  \ncrimination \n520 U.S. at 481, and that burden remains on the plaintiff \nin litigation challenging a State’s legislative adoption of \na remedial plan in response to a prior judicial order, see, \ne.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978) (princi-\npal opinion); U.S. Br. 28-29 (citing other authorities). \n\nFinally, plaintiffs are wrong to suggest (Cong. Br. 28) \nthat the district court’s approach is necessary to ensure \nthat legislatures do not engage in opportunistic behavior.  \nThe strong presumption of good faith advocated by the \nUnited  States  applies when  a state  legislature  enacts  a \nplan ordered by a district court after determining that it \nsatisfies (or likely satisfies) constitutional and statutory \nrequirements,  not  any  time  that  a  legislature  “reen-\nact[s]” a statute.  Ibid.  Moreover, our approach does not \ndictate  a  result  as  a  matter  of  law.   If  a plaintiff  shows \nthat  a  legislature  permanently  adopted  a  judicially  ap-\nproved plan not because it legitimately believed that plan \n\n \n\f15 \n\nto be lawful, but rather because it sought to preserve dis-\ncrimination  that  somehow  escaped  judicial invalidation, \na plaintiff can succeed in establishing its claim of inten-\ntional vote dilution.  See U.S. Br. 30-31.  A court is not \nrequired  to  “take  at  face  value”  (Cong.  Br.  2)  a  State’s \nassertion that its reenacted plan is lawful.  But plaintiffs \nbear a heavy burden in establishing that a state legisla-\nture’s adoption of a court-ordered plan was intentionally \ndiscriminatory.   \n\nB.  Plaintiffs  Have  Not  Identified  Facts  Sufficient  To  \n\nRebut The Presumption Of Good Faith   \n\nAs previously explained (U.S. Br. 31-37), it was only by \nrelying on the flawed assumption that discriminatory in-\ntent “carr[ies] over” from one plan to the next, C.J.S. App. \n46a,  unless  and  until  a  State  proves  it  has  “cured  [the] \ntaint,”  id.  at  40a,  that the  district  court  reached its  ulti-\nmate conclusion that the 2013 plans were intentionally dis-\ncriminatory.  The court did not point to any evidence suf-\nficient to rebut the strong presumption of good faith that \napplies  in  these  circumstances.    Nor  do  plaintiffs  make \nany real effort to do so before this Court. \n\nPlaintiffs in  the  congressional  case  consign their re-\nsponse to a single footnote, asserting that “[e]ven were \nthe Court to determine that the proper focus of the ques-\ntions  of  motive, intent,  and purpose  is  the  action  of  the \n2013 Legislature instead of the 2011 Legislature,  * * *  \n[the  district  court’s]  findings  are  not  clearly  erroneous \nand should not be overturned by the Court.”  Cong. Br. \n34 n.20.  The other plaintiffs similarly ask this Court to \nignore the district court’s errors of law by invoking the \n“deferential  clear-error  standard.”    House  Br.  41.    As \nthis Court has long recognized, however, the clear-error \nstandard does not apply to “a finding of fact that is pred-\nicated  on  a  misunderstanding  of  the  governing  rule  of \n\n \n\f16 \n\nlaw.”    Bose  Corp.  v.  Consumers  Union  of  U.S.,  Inc., \n466 U.S.  485,  501  (1984);  cf.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1474 \n(“[W]e review a district court’s finding as to racial pre-\ndominance  only  for  clear  error,  except  when  the  court \nmade a legal mistake.”). \n\nInstead  of  identifying  record  evidence  that  demon-\nstrates  discriminatory  intent  by  the  2013  Legislature, \nplaintiffs reiterate the conclusory statements in the dis-\ntrict court’s opinions.  For example, plaintiffs recite that \nthe court “found that the State stuck with its original dis-\ntricts because it ‘intended’ to ‘maintain[]’ the discrimina-\ntory  ‘taint’  that  had  originally  motivated  the  districts.”  \nHouse  Br.  41  (quoting  H.J.S.  App.  359a)  (brackets  in \noriginal).  But the cited page of the court’s decision refers \nto no evidence, and instead expounds upon the court’s le-\ngal premise that the “racially discriminatory intent and \neffects that [the court] previously found in the 2011 plans \ncarry over into the 2013 plans where those district lines \nremain unchanged.”  H.J.S. App. 359a. \n\nSimilarly,  plaintiffs  echo  the  district  court’s  pur-\nported  “f [inding]”  that  the  2013  Legislature  “ ‘did  not \nadopt the Court’s plans with the intent to adopt legally \ncompliant  plans  free  from  discriminatory  taint,  but  as \npart  of  a  litigation  strategy.’ ”    Cong.  Br.  20  (quoting \nC.J.S. App. 40a); see House Br. 19-20, 43.  As noted (U.S. \nBr. 41), a State’s decision to accept a judicially vetted re-\nmedial  plan  presumptively  furthers—not  frustrates—\nCongress’s goals of preventing and redressing unlawful \ndiscrimination.  And plaintiffs point to nothing in the trial \nrecord showing that the State’s “litigation strategy” was \na pernicious one designed to reinforce existing discrimi-\nnation,  as  opposed  to  an  effort  to  enact  a  lawful  redis-\ntricting plan.  Plaintiffs’ assertion that “Texas wanted to \nbring  this  litigation  to  an  end  in  order  to  keep in place \n\n \n\f17 \n\nthe  districts  its  Legislature  had  drawn  in  2011  for  dis-\ncriminatory reasons,” House Br. 45 (emphasis omitted), \nappears to rest only on speculation, not on evidence.  \n\nPlaintiffs  also  posit  that  the  district  court  “heard \nTexas’s  witnesses  [and]  found  their  proffered  explana-\ntions pretextual.”  House Br. 41 (citing H.J.S. App. 345a-\n346a, 348a, 353a-359a); cf. C.J.S. App. 32a-46a (contain-\ning same passages).  But the cited pages do not reference \nany testimony that the court found “pretextual” or oth-\nerwise not credible.  Instead, those pages contain discus-\nsion  articulating  the  court’s  legal  theory,  H.J.S.  App. \n345a-348a,  and  explaining  its  conclusion  that  the  2013 \nLegislature failed to “engage in a deliberative process to \nensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 \nplans,” id. at 353a; see id. at 353a-359a.  The sole witness \nfor the State whose testimony the court described at any \nlength was Jeff Archer, the Legislature’s chief counsel.  \nSee H.J.S. App. 356a-358a & nn.43, 45; C.J.S. App. 43a-\n45a & nn.43, 45.  But the court credited that testimony:  \nArcher  testified,  and  the  court  agreed,  that  the  2013 \nLegislature  was  aware  that  the  interim  plans  were \nbased on provisional rulings rather than “final determi-\nnations,”  C.J.S.  App.  43a,  and  that  enacting  the  2013 \nplans  would  likely  not  moot  the  litigation  because \n“Plaintiffs  would  pursue  claims  against  the  interim \nmaps,” id. at 44a n.45.   \n\nIt is true that the 2013 plans were enacted by “a sub-\nstantially similar Legislature with the same leadership” \nas existed in 2011.  House Br. 46 (quoting H.J.S. App. \n352a n.37).  Contrary to plaintiffs’ assumption, however, \na court is not “entitled to infer” (ibid.) that a later leg-\nislature has acted with discriminatory intent solely be-\ncause  a  prior  legislature  was  found  to  have  done  so.  \n“[P]ast discrimination cannot, in the manner of original \n\n \n\f18 \n\nsin, condemn governmental action that is not itself unlaw-\nful.”    City  of  Mobile  v.  Bolden,  446  U.S.  55,  74  (1980) \n(plurality opinion).  If the existence of past misconduct \nwere  sufficient,  standing  alone,  to  sustain  a  finding  of \npresent misconduct, the presumption of legislative good \nfaith would have no meaning.  U.S. Br. 28. \n\nPlaintiffs  suggest  that  the  Legislature  enacted  the \n2013 plans “with no discussion or debate over concerns \nraised by minority legislators.”  House Br. 46.  Plaintiffs \ndo not identify evidence in the trial record that they be-\nlieve supports that observation.  In any event, plaintiffs \nfail  to  explain  why  the  appropriate  inference  to  be \ndrawn  from  the  Legislature’s  adoption  of  the  interim \nplans largely without amendment was that the Legisla-\nture was motivated by intentional discrimination, as op-\nposed  to  an  interest  in  enacting  lawful  plans  likely  to \nsurvive further challenge.  Indeed, the Legislature may \nhave been concerned that if it engaged in race-conscious \nrevisions of the interim plans, it could later face claims \nthat it engaged in impermissible racial gerrymandering \nby drawing majority-minority districts that the court it-\nself had previously determined were likely not required \nby the VRA.  Cf. id. at 52 (arguing that legislative revi-\nsions to HD90 in 2013 caused it to become a “deliberate \nracial gerrymander”). \n\nFinally,  plaintiffs  seek  to  treat  as  evidence  of  dis-\ncrimination the fact that the challenged districts in the \n2013 plans were “exactly the same” as the correspond-\ning districts in the 2011 plans.  House Br. 46; see Cong. \nBr. 1, 18, 24, 28.  But those districts were identical pre-\ncisely  because  the  district  court,  consistent  with  this \nCourt’s directives in Perry, had allowed their continued \nuse  in  2012  after  finding  that  plaintiffs’  challenges  to \n\n \n\f19 \n\nthose districts were unlikely to succeed or were insub-\nstantial.  The very facts that render a legislative action \nentitled to the strong presumption of good faith cannot \nsimultaneously rebut that presumption. \n\nIII.  CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT \n\n35 \n\nIS  NOT  AN  \n\nUNCONSTITUTIONAL RACIAL GERRYMANDER  \nA.  The  district  court  also  erred  in  concluding  that \nCD35  was  an  unconstitutional  racial  gerrymander.    See \nU.S. Br. 44-48.  As an initial matter, the circumstances of \nthe Legislature’s action indicate that race did not predom-\ninate  in  CD35’s  enactment  in  2013  because  the  Legisla-\nture enacted the 2013 congressional plan so that all of its \ndistricts would match precisely the districts provisionally \nfound to be lawful in 2012.  Cf. Texas Br. 34a-36a (text of \n2013 enactment “adopt[ing]” court’s interim redistricting \nplan “as the [State’s] permanent plan”).   \n\nIn any event, CD35 would survive strict scrutiny be-\ncause  the  State  had  “good  reasons”  to  believe  that  the \nVRA required it to draw CD35 in 2011 and to maintain it \nin 2013.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation omitted).  In-\ndeed,  in  2011,  a  subset  of  plaintiffs  proposed  and  sup-\nported the creation of CD35 as “an appropriate § 2” La-\ntino opportunity district.  C.J.S. App. 174a.  And in 2012, \nthe  district  court  itself  provisionally  concluded  that \nCD35  was  a  valid  Section  2  district.    Id.  at  409a-415a.  \nThose considerations provided, at a minimum, sufficient \n“breathing room” for the State to reasonably conclude in \n2013  that  CD35  addressed  a  VRA  need  and  that  main-\ntaining it would not violate the Equal Protection Clause.  \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation omitted). \n\nB.  Plaintiffs’ responses identify no sound basis for con-\ncluding otherwise.  Plaintiffs assert that the district court \nwas correct to find racial predominance because “nearly \n\n \n\f20 \n\nevery traditional districting principle in CD35 was subor-\ndinated to race.”  Cong. Br. 36.  But that argument improp-\nerly focuses on 2011, when CD35 was first drawn, rather \nthan on 2013, when the operative congressional plan was \nenacted  in  accordance  with  the  district  boundaries  that \nthe court provisionally found lawful in 2012.   \n\nPlaintiffs’ discussion of strict scrutiny repeats the dis-\ntrict  court’s  errors.    Plaintiffs  note  that  “[t]he  district \ncourt found  * * *  that ‘the third Gingles precondition is \nnot  present  in  a  significant  portion  of  the  district’ ”  be-\ncause  “Travis  County  Anglos  lack  cohesion  and  split \ntheir  vote.”    Cong.  Br.  38  (citation  omitted);  cf.  Thorn-\nburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 51 (1986) (requiring that the \n“majority  votes  sufficiently  as  a  bloc  to  enable  it    * * *  \nusually  to  defeat  the  minority’s  preferred  candidate”).  \nBut as this Court has explained, “the basic unit of analysis \nfor racial gerrymandering claims  * * *  is the district,” \nand a court should not focus on “particular portions [of \nthe district] in isolation.”  Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 800.  \nThe district court here failed to address whether voting \npatterns were racially polarized across CD35 as a whole.  \nAnd  had  it  performed  the  required  “holistic  analysis,” \nibid.,  the  court  necessarily  would  have  concluded  that  \nracially polarized voting existed in CD35.  See U.S. Br. \n47-48. \n\nPlaintiffs  also theorize  (Cong.  Br.  39) that the  State \ncannot “seek refuge in § 2” because the creation of CD35 \nwas  not  contemporaneously  “informed  by”  an  “inquiry \ninto § 2 requirements.”  But as already noted, a group of \nplaintiffs  themselves  urged  the  Legislature  to  draw \nCD35 in 2011 precisely because they believed the district \nto be required by Section 2.  See C.J.S. App. 174a; C.J.S. \nSupp. App. 152a, 158a, 315a-317a, 319a-320a.  All agreed \nin  2011  that  at  least  seven  Latino  opportunity  districts \n\n \n\f21 \n\nneeded to be drawn in South and West Texas in order to \ncomply with the VRA, see C.J.S. App. 112a & n.85, 126a-\n127a,  176a,  and  CD35  extended  within  that  region.  \nMoreover,  this  Court’s  racial-gerrymandering  prece-\ndents do not require a State, in drawing a Section 2 dis-\ntrict, to develop the full factual record that it could later \nmarshal in subsequent litigation.  To survive strict scru-\ntiny,  it  suffices  that  the  State’s  “actual  purpose”  was \ncompliance with the VRA and that it had a “strong basis \nin evidence to support that justification,” even if that ba-\nsis in evidence was not contemporaneously memorialized \nin exhaustive detail.  Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. 899, 908 n.4 \n(1996).  And when the Legislature enacted the 2013 plan \ncontaining CD35, the district court’s 2012 decision itself \nfurnished a strong basis in evidence.   \n\nFinally, plaintiffs suggest that CD35 cannot survive \nstrict  scrutiny  because  the  Legislature’s  “ ‘actual  pur-\npose’ ” in drawing CD35 was to “dismantle[] the existing \ncrossover district there” (i.e., former CD25).  Cong. Br. \n39  (citation  omitted);  cf.  U.S.  Br.  10  n.5  (defining \n“ ‘crossover’  district”).    But  the  district  court  made  no \nsuch  finding.    Indeed,  plaintiffs  sought  to  press  the \nsame argument about CD25 as a freestanding claim of \nintentional  racial  discrimination,  but  the  district  court \nexpressly declined to reach that claim.  See C.J.S. App. \n111a  n.83,  172a  n.38.    And  when  the  court  earlier  ad-\ndressed  that  claim  in  the  context  of  the  2012  interim \nplans, it was “unable to conclude” that the “dismantling \nof CD 25 was motivated by a discriminatory purpose as \nopposed to partisan politics.”  Id. at 415a.7  Plaintiffs thus \n\n7  The United States argued in the preclearance litigation that CD25 \nwas not a “protected crossover district” and that its dismantlement \ntherefore was not unlawful.  Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d \n\n \n                                                      \n\f22 \n\nfail in their effort to indirectly challenge the elimination of \nformer CD25 by recasting it as a racial-gerrymandering \nchallenge to CD35.   \n\n*  *  *  *  * \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons  and  those  stated  in  our \nopening brief, the Court should reject the bases for the \ndistrict court’s findings of intentional discrimination as \nto eight unchanged districts, and it should reverse the \nfinding of a racial gerrymander as to CD35. \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\nAPRIL 2018 \n\n  NOEL J.
