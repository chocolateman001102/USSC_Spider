Whether  the  district  court  issued  an  appealable \ninterlocutory  injunction  when  it  invalidated  Texas  con-\ngressional and state-house redistricting plans and effec-\ntively prevented Texas from using those plans in future \nelections, by imposing expedited deadlines for the State \nto  either  engage  in  another  round  of  legislative  redis-\ntricting or face court-imposed redistricting just days be-\nfore districts had to be set for the 2018 elections. \n\n2.   Whether the Texas Legislature acted with an un-\nlawful purpose when it enacted districts imposed by the \ndistrict  court  itself—which  the  district  court  had  im-\nposed pursuant to this Court’s 2012 mandate to fix any \nplausible  constitutional  and  statutory  defects  in  prior \nlegislative plans that were repealed without ever having \ntaken effect—and when there was no unlawful taint be-\nhind these court-imposed districts to begin with, as the \ndistrict court explained in its lengthy 2012 opinions. \n\n3.  Whether  state-house  districts  in  Nueces  County \nproduced  a  vote-dilution  effect  when  the  district  court \nexpressly recognized that an additional performing ma-\njority-minority opportunity district could not be created \nthere  without  breaking  the  State’s  rule  to  maintain \ncounty lines if possible—which the court held was not re-\nquired by the Voting Rights Act. \n\n4.  Whether the Texas Legislature engaged in racial \ngerrymandering \nin  reconfiguring  Tarrant  County’s \nHD90  when  the  Legislature  had  a  strong  basis  in  evi-\ndence to believe that consideration of race was necessary \nunder the Voting Rights Act to maintain HD90 as a ma-\njority-Hispanic district. \n\n(I)",

        "IN T R O D U C T IO N \n\nThere are few things a legislature can do to avoid pro-\ntracted litigation over its redistricting legislation. But if \nthe nearly inevitable litigation comes to pass, one would \nhave thought there was one reasonably safe course avail-\nable  to bring  it  to  an end—namely, enacting the three-\njudge  court’s  remedial  redistricting  plan  as the  legisla-\nture’s own. Think again.  \n\nAs it turns out, even that will not suffice, as the deci-\nsions below reached the remarkable conclusion that the \nTexas Legislature engaged in intentional racial discrim-\nination by enacting into law maps imposed by the same \ndistrict court one cycle earlier to remedy alleged infirmi-\nties with the Legislature’s initial maps. According to the \ndistrict court, its own maps were infected with the “taint \nof  discriminatory  intent”—a  taint  that  the  Legislature \n(but apparently not the court) was obligated to “remove” \nif it wanted to adopt those maps as state law rather than \njust abide by them as a judicial decree. \n\nThat  conclusion  is  every  bit  as  implausible  as  it \nsounds  and  entirely  turns  on  its  head  this  Court’s  re-\npeated emphasis on the primacy of States and state leg-\nislatures when it comes to redistricting. The maps at is-\nsue  here  were  imposed  after  this  Court  instructed  the \ndistrict  court  “to  draw  interim  maps”  for  Texas’s  2012 \nelections “that do not violate the Constitution or the Vot-\ning Rights Act.” Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 396 (2012) \n(per curiam). And by its own telling in lengthy 2012 opin-\nions, the district court assiduously abided by that man-\ndate. There is absolutely no support for the novel propo-\n\n(1)",
        "2 \n\nsition that the same map can be constitutional when im-\nposed by the court, but unconstitutional—let alone inten-\ntionally discriminatory—when embraced by the legisla-\nture.  If  anything,  the strong  presumption  of  good  faith \nthat applies to state redistricting legislation ought to be \nvirtually  unassailable  when  a  legislature  enacts  redis-\ntricting plans only after a federal court has issued opin-\nions explaining in exhaustive detail how those plans ad-\ndressed every “plausible” constitutional or statutory ob-\njection, H.J.S. App. 313a, and were “not purposefully dis-\ncriminatory,” C.J.S. App. 408a.  \n\nThe district court concluded otherwise only by jetti-\nsoning nearly every pillar of this Court’s redistricting ju-\nrisprudence—from  the  strong  presumption  of  constitu-\ntionality  and  good  faith,  to  the  primacy  of  States  and \nstate  legislatures  in  redistricting,  to  the  extraordinary \ncaution  courts  must  exercise  when  confronting  inten-\ntional-discrimination claims, to the principle that inten-\ntional vote dilution exists only when the legislature actu-\nally  sets  out  to  reduce  minority  voting  strength,  to  the \nrule  that  VRA  compliance  is  a  defense  to  racial-gerry-\nmandering claims. Under a correct application of those \nsettled legal principles, the plaintiffs have not come close \nto satisfying their burden of proving that the Legislature \nenacted the district court’s own maps in a sinister effort \nto discriminate against minority voters. Instead, all the \nevidence  confirms  that  the  obvious  answer  is  the  right \none: the Legislature embraced the court’s maps for the \nperfectly permissible reason that it wanted to bring the \nlitigation  to  an  end  and  took  the  court  at  its  word  that \nthose maps complied with the Constitution and the VRA.",
        "3 \n\nThe district court’s decision to invalidate its own reme-\ndial maps as intentionally discriminatory cannot stand.  \n\nO PIN IO N S   B E LO W \n\nThe  three-judge  district  court’s  order  on  Plan  C235 \nis available at 274 F.

In 2011, following the decennial census, the Texas \nLegislature enacted redistricting plans for Texas state-\nlegislative and congressional districts.2 Before the Leg-\nislature even enacted those plans, however, the plaintiffs \nfiled  this  lawsuit  challenging  the  State’s  congressional \nredistricting plan (Plan C185) and its redistricting plan \nfor  the  Texas  State  House  of  Representatives  (Plan \nH283)  under  the  Constitution  and  VRA  §2.  The  Chief \nJudge of the Fifth Circuit constituted a three-judge dis-\ntrict court under 28 U.S.C. §2284. J.A. 2a.  \n\nBecause  Texas  was subject to  VRA  §5  at  that  time, \nits legislatively enacted plans could not take legal effect \nuntil they were precleared. See 52 U.S.C. §10304. Texas \nsought preclearance by filing a suit for declaratory judg-\nment in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia.  \n\nB.  While  the  D.C.  preclearance  lawsuit  was  still \npending, the Texas three-judge district court proceeded \nto  conduct  a  two-week  trial  on  the  constitutional  and \nVRA  §2  challenges  to the  not-yet-operative 2011  plans. \nJ.A.  13a-17a.  Because a  final  judgment in  the preclear-\nance  litigation  seemed  unlikely  to  come  in  time  for  the \n2012 election cycle, the district court ordered the parties \nto submit proposed interim plans for the 2012 elections. \nJ.A. 17a-18a. \n\n2 Act of May 21, 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 1271, 2011 Tex. Gen. \nLaws  3435-3552  (creating  Plan  H283);  Act  of  June  20,  2011, \n82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 1, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 5091-5180 (cre-\nating Plan C185).",
        "5 \n\nIn November 2011, a 2-1 majority of the district court \nentered  separate  orders  directing  the  State  to  conduct \nthe 2012 elections under plans drawn by the court. Con-\ncluding that it “was not required to give any deference to \nthe Legislature’s enacted plan,” the majority announced \nthat it had drawn “independent map[s]” based on “neu-\ntral principles that advance the interest of the collective \npublic  good.”  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  396.  Judge  Smith  dis-\nsented  from  both  orders,  explaining  that  the  majority \nhad imposed  “a  runaway plan  that imposes  an extreme \nredistricting  scheme”  that  was  completely  “untethered \nto the applicable caselaw.” H.J.S. App. 279a.  \n\nThe  State  appealed,  and  on  January  20,  2012,  this \nCourt  unanimously  vacated  the  district  court’s  orders, \nholding that “the District Court exceeded its mission to \ndraw  interim  maps  that  do  not  violate  the  Constitution \nor the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept \nof ‘the collective public good’ for the Texas Legislature’s \ndetermination of which policies serve ‘the interests of the \ncitizens  of  Texas.’”  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  396.  Reiterating \nthat “[r]edistricting is primarily the duty and responsi-\nbility  of  the  State,”  id.  at  392  (quoting  Chapman  v. \nMeier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975)), this Court explained that a \ndistrict court forced to impose its own redistricting map \nshould not simply “ignore any state plan that has not re-\nceived § 5 preclearance.” Id. at 395. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  however,  this  Court  made  clear \nthat a district court imposing an interim plan “must, of \ncourse, take care not to incorporate into the interim plan \nany  legal  defects.”  Id.  at  394.  Indeed,  the  Court  ex-\ninstructed  the  district  court—six  separate \npressly",
        "6 \n\ntimes—that  it  must  impose  plans  that  comply  with  the \nConstitution and the VRA: \n\n•  The district court’s “mission [is] to draw interim \nmaps  that  do  not  violate  the  Constitution  or  the \nVoting Rights Act.” Id. at 396. \n\n•  “A district court making . . . use of a State’s plan \nmust, of course, take care not to incorporate into \nthe  interim  plan  any  legal  defects  in  the  state \nplan.” Id. at 394. \n\n•  “[A]  district  court  should  still  be  guided  by  [the \nState’s] plan, except to the extent those legal chal-\nlenges  are  shown  to  have  a  likelihood  of  success \non the merits.” Id. \n\n•  “[T]he  district  court  [must]  confine[]  itself  to \ndrawing interim maps that comply with the Con-\nstitution and the Voting Rights Act, without dis-\nplacing legitimate state policy judgments with the \ncourt’s own preferences.” Id. \n\n•  “‘[A] court, as a general rule, should be guided by \nthe legislative policies underlying’ a state plan—\neven one that was itself unenforceable—‘to the ex-\ntent those policies do not lead to violations of the \nConstitution or the Voting Rights Act.’” Id. at 393 \n(quoting  Abrams  v.  Johnson,  521  U.S.  74,  79 \n(1997)). \n\n•  The district court should “take guidance from the \nlawful  policies  incorporated  in  [a  not-yet-pre-\ncleared] plan.” Id. at 395.",
        "7 \n\nMoreover, this Court made clear that when assessing \nwhether  the  State’s  plans  suffered  from  any  “legal  de-\nfects,”  the  district  court  need  not  confine  itself  to  ad-\ndressing  proven  constitutional  or  VRA  violations.  In-\nstead, given the preliminary posture of the litigation, the \nCourt instructed the district court to remedy any district \nas to which the plaintiffs had demonstrated that a consti-\ntutional  or  VRA  §2  claim  was  “likely  to  succeed  on  the \nmerits,”  id.  at  394,  as  well  as  any  “aspects  of  the  state \nplan that stand a reasonable probability of failing to gain \n§ 5 preclearance,” which the Court also described as any \naspect of the plan subject to a “not insubstantial” §5 chal-\nlenge.  Id.  at  395.  In  other  words,  the  Court  instructed \nthe district court to adopt maps that remedied not only \nany  actual  constitutional  or  VRA  violations,  but  also \n“likely” violations and “not insubstantial” §5 claims.   \n\nC.  On remand, the parties submitted proposed find-\nings  of  fact  and  extensive  briefing,  including  post-trial \nbriefs from the preclearance litigation. C.J.S. App. 380a; \nJ.A.  26a-50a.  After  holding  two  more  days  of  hearings, \nJ.A. 43a, the district court adopted interim congressional \nand  state-house  plans  for  the  2012  elections.  The  court \nexplained that its interim plans “obey[ed] the Supreme \nCourt’s directive by adhering to the State’s enacted plan \nexcept in the discrete areas in which we have preliminar-\nily found plausible legal defects.” H.J.S. App. 313a. The \ncourt noted that it reviewed all pending VRA §5 objec-\ntions, including claims of discriminatory purpose, under \n“the low ‘not insubstantial’ standard” this Court articu-\nlated. Id.",
        "8 \n\nStarting  with  the  congressional  plan,  the  district \ncourt  imposed  as  its  interim  plan  Plan  C235,  which  re-\nconfigured nine of the 36 congressional districts from the \nState’s  2011  plan.  C.J.S.  App.  367a-423a.  In  a  56-page \nopinion, the court concluded that Plan C235 “sufficiently \nresolves the ‘not insubstantial’ § 5 claims and that no § 2 \nor  Fourteenth  Amendment  claims  preclude  its  ac-\nceptance  under  a  preliminary  injunction  standard.”  Id. \nat  396a.  In  doing  so,  the  court  specifically  found  that \n“C235  is  not  purposefully  discriminatory.”  Id.  at  408a. \nThe court devoted 13 pages to explaining why plaintiffs \nwere not likely to succeed on their claims concerning two \ndistricts that Plan C235 did not change—CD27, based in \nCorpus Christi, and CD35, linking Austin and San Anto-\nnio.3 As to the former, the court spent six pages explain-\ning why CD27 did not intentionally dilute minority voting \nstrength. See id. at 417a-423a. As to the latter, the court \nspent seven explaining why CD35 was not a racial gerry-\nmander. See id. at 408a-417a. \n\nThe district court imposed Plan H309 as its interim \nHouse plan. Plan H309 reconfigured 28 of the State’s 150 \nstate-house districts. H.J.S. App. 300a. The district court \nexpressly  declined,  however,  to  reconfigure  the  state-\nhouse  districts  in  Bell,  Dallas,  Nueces,  and  Tarrant \nCounties, id. at 314a, finding that the plaintiffs were not \nlikely to succeed on their §2 vote dilution claims and that \nany §5 claims were insubstantial. Id. at 308a-309a.  \n\n3  This  brief  refers  to  congressional  districts  by  the  abbrevia-\ntion  “CD”  followed  by  the  district  number.  It  refers  to  state-\nhouse districts by the abbreviation “HD” followed by the dis-\ntrict number.",
        "9 \n\nD.  After the Texas district court imposed its interim \nplans,  the  D.C.  district  court  denied  VRA  §5  preclear-\nance to the 2011 plans. See Texas v. United States, 887 \nF. Supp.  2d  133  (D.D.C.  2012), vacated,  133 S.  Ct.  2885 \n(2013)  (mem.).  Although  the  plaintiffs  asked  the  Texas \ncourt to modify its court-ordered plans based on the D.C. \ncourt’s  preclearance  decision,  the  court  declined.  This \nCourt  then  denied  an  application  to  stay  Plan  C235  in \nlight  of  the  preclearance  denial,  LULAC  v.  Perry,  133 \nS. Ct. 96 (2012) (mem.), and the State conducted its 2012 \nelections under the court-ordered Plans C235 and H309.  \nE.  Although the State appealed the D.C. court’s pre-\nclearance  decision,  before  that  appeal  could  be  consid-\nered, state officials began to urge the Legislature to con-\nsider a different path forward—one that could bring cer-\ntainty  to  the  State’s  elections  and  avoid  several  more \nyears of protracted litigation. The Texas Attorney Gen-\neral implored the Legislature that “the best way to rem-\nedy the violations found by the D.C. court is to adopt the \ncourt-drawn interim plans as the State’s permanent re-\ndistricting  maps.”  C.J.S.  App.  432a.  As  he  further  ex-\nplained,  permanently  adopting  the  court-ordered  plans \nwould “confirm the legislature’s intent for a redistricting \nplan that fully comports with the law.” Id. at 429a. Ech-\noing the same view, on May 27, 2013, the Governor called \nthe Legislature into a special session “[t]o consider leg-\nislation which ratifies and adopts the interim redistrict-\ning plans ordered by the federal district court.” Procla-\nmation by the Governor, No. 41-3324 (May 27, 2013).",
        "10 \n\nThe  Legislature  decided  to  follow  that  advice:  On \nJune 21 and 23, 2013, it formally repealed the 2011 redis-\ntricting  plans,  adopted  the  court-ordered  Plan  C235  in \nfull, and adopted the court-ordered Plan H309 with mi-\nnor changes as Plan H358. On June 26, 2013, the Gover-\nnor signed into law the bills adopting Plan C235 and Plan \nH358.4  \n\nF.  After the Legislature repealed the 2011 plans, the \nState  moved  to  dismiss  the  plaintiffs’  claims  against \nthose  plans  as  moot,  as  the  plans  they  challenged  no \nlonger existed. J.A. 59a. The district court summarily de-\nnied that motion without even waiting for the plaintiffs \nto respond. J.A. 60a. The district court then granted the \nplaintiffs  leave  to  amend  their  complaints  to  assert \nclaims  against  the  newly  enacted  plans—i.e.,  claims \nagainst  the  same  districts  that  the  court  itself  had  im-\nposed on the State for the 2012 elections, plus one state-\nhouse district (HD90) that had been modified slightly in \n2013. J.A. 62a-63a. But instead of adjudicating those new \nchallenges to the plans that were actually in effect, the \ncourt  allowed  the  plaintiffs  to  continue  pursuing  their \nclaims  against  the  2011  plans—plans  that had  been  re-\npealed  and  that  had  never  taken  effect.  The  court  also \ngranted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaints to \n\n4 On June 25, 2013, this Court held VRA §4(b)’s coverage for-\nmula  unconstitutional.  Shelby  County  v.  Holder,  133  S.  Ct. \n2612, 2631 (2013). The Court later vacated the judgment in the \nD.C. preclearance lawsuit and remanded for further proceed-\nings in light of Shelby County. Texas v. United States, 133 S. \nCt.  2885  (2013)  (mem.).  The  preclearance  litigation  was  ulti-\nmately dismissed as moot. C.J.S. App. 10a.",
        "11 \n\nseek  preclearance  bail-in  under  VRA  §3  based  on  the \n2011  plans—once  again  rejecting  the  State’s  argument \nthat claims against those plans were moot. J.A. 62a-63a.5 \nThe district court then conducted a second trial on claims \nchallenging the repealed 2011 House plan, J.A. 87a-89a, \nas  well  as  a  second  trial  on  claims  challenging  the  re-\npealed 2011 congressional plan, J.A. 91a-93a.  \n\nAt the same time that it continued to adjudicate moot \nchallenges  to  the  defunct  2011  plans,  the  district  court \nrefused plaintiffs’ requests to enjoin the plans enacted by \nthe Legislature in 2013. J.A. 52a-53a, 94a. As a result, the \nState conducted elections under the legislatively adopted \n2013 plans in 2014 and 2016. \n\nG.  More than two years after the second trial on the \n2011 plans, and almost four years after those plans had \nbeen  repealed,  the  district  court  issued  opinions  hold-\ning—by  a  2-1  vote—that  the  plaintiffs’  claims  against \nthose plans were not moot, that the 2011 Legislature en-\ngaged in  intentional  racial  discrimination  and  unconsti-\ntutional racial gerrymandering, and that the 2011 plans \nhad the effect of diluting minority voting strength in vio-\nlation  of  VRA  §2.  C.J.S.  App.  330a-331a;  H.J.S.  App. \n275a. The majority also found that the plaintiffs proved \n“one  person,  one  vote  Larios-type  claims”  in  discrete \nportions of Plan H283, id. at 276a, but rejected statewide \none-person, one-vote claims, id. at 272a.  \n\n5 The United States intervened to assert claims against the re-\npealed  2011  plans  but  did  not  assert  any  claims  against  the \n2013 plans. J.A. 62a.",
        "12 \n\nJudge Smith dissented as to both jurisdiction and the \nmerits. He explained that the plaintiffs’ challenges to the \n2011 plan were moot because those plans were repealed \nin 2013 and, indeed, had never taken effect. C.J.S. App. \n336a-349a; H.J.S. App. 280a. On the merits, he explained \nthat  the  majority’s  opinion  “concoct[ed]  the  most  ex-\ntreme possible reading of the raw record to justify find-\nings  that,  if  converted  to  corresponding  remedies,  will \nhand these plaintiffs pretty much everything they have \nsought, causing a wholesale revision in the State House \nand  Congressional  maps.”  H.J.S.  App.  278a-279a.  He \nnoted that the majority’s factual findings were legally in-\nfirm, but “even under the clearly-erroneous test, the ma-\njority’s findings are fatally infected, from start to finish.” \nH.J.S. App. 278a.6  \n\nH.  Having spent four years adjudicating moot chal-\nlenges  to  the  repealed  2011  plans,  the  district  court  fi-\nnally turned to the plaintiffs’ challenges to the operative \n2013  plans  (Plans  C235  and  H358),  holding  a  trial  on \nthose claims in July 2017. C.J.S. App. 14a. In sharp con-\ntrast to the two years the court spent reaching resolution \nfollowing  the  trial  on  the  defunct  2011  plans,  the  court \nissued a divided decision on Plan C235 a mere month af-\nter  the  trial  ended.  Id.  at  14a  n.13,  119a.  Remarkably, \neven though that plan was identical to the one the court \nitself imposed in 2012, the court invalidated two districts \n\n6  Judge  Smith  concurred,  however,  in  the  majority’s  narrow \nconclusion,  with  respect  to  one-person,  one-vote  claims,  that \nthe 2011 Legislature “erred in assuming . . . that the ten-per-\ncent test offers an unassailable safe haven.” H.J.S. App. 278a \nn.1.",
        "13 \n\nin Plan C235 on the ground that they were the product \nof  intentional  discrimination.  The  court  concluded  that \nthe  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional  vote  dilution  by \nadopting CD27 even though the court-ordered plan left \nCD27  unchanged  after  considering  its  alleged  infirmi-\nties, and engaged in racial gerrymandering by adopting \nCD35 even though the court-ordered plan preserved that \ndistrict over objections as well. Id. at 117a-118a. \n\nOne  week  later,  the  district  court  issued  an  opinion \ninvalidating  certain  state-house  districts  in  Plan  H358. \nH.J.S.  App.  7a  n.5,  84a-85a.  Here,  too,  the  court  con-\ncluded  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional  dis-\ncrimination  by  preserving  verbatim  several  districts \nfrom the district court’s own 2012 interim map—specifi-\ncally,  HD54  and  HD55  (Bell  County);  HD103,  HD104, \nand  HD105  (Dallas  County);  and  HD32  and  HD34 \n(Nueces County). Id. at 85a. The district also found “a §2 \nresults violation insofar as two compact [Hispanic citizen \nvoting-age  population  (HCVAP)]-majority  opportunity \ndistricts could be drawn within Nueces County.” Id. But \nthe district court itself simultaneously recognized that it \nwas  not  possible  to  draw  two  performing  majority-mi-\nnority  districts  within  Nueces  County,  id.  at  49a-50a \n(noting  that  attempts to  draw two  such districts  within \nNueces  County  left  Hispanic  voters  “essentially  worse \noff than under Plan H358 because one district would not \nperform  at  all  and  one  performed  poorly  (compared  to \nPlan H358, where one district does perform consistently \nfor Latinos)”), and the court declined to find “that § 2 re-\nquires breaking the County Line Rule to draw such dis-\ntricts.”  Id.  at  85a.  Finally,  turning  to  HD90  (Tarrant",
        "14 \n\nCounty), one of the very few districts that the 2013 Leg-\nislature had altered as compared to the court-ordered re-\nmedial map, the district court rejected the plaintiffs’ in-\ntentional-vote-dilution  claim  but  sustained  their  racial-\ngerrymandering  claim—even  though  the  2013  Legisla-\nture  had  redrawn  HD90  to  address  vote-dilution  con-\ncerns raised by plaintiffs in this very case. Id.  \n\nWhile the district court declined to style either of its \nopinions as an “injunction,” each one invalidated aspects \nof  the  State’s  maps,  and  each  gave  the  Governor  only \nthree business days to order a special session of the Leg-\nislature to draw a new map. If the Governor declined to \ndo so, the orders compelled defendants to prepare reme-\ndial map proposals and appear at hearings mere weeks \nlater  to  redraw  Texas’s  maps.  H.J.S.  App.  86a;  C.J.S. \nApp.  118a-119a.  Because  the  deadline  for  finalizing  all \ndistricts for the 2018 election cycle was fast approaching, \nand  the  district  court’s  orders  made  plain  that  Texas \ncould  not  use  its  existing  maps  in  the  impending  elec-\ntions,  Texas  sought  and  obtained  stays  of  both  orders \npending appeal. Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 49 (2017).",
        "15 \n\nS U M M A R Y  O F  A R G U M E N T \n\nIn  2013,  the  Texas  Legislature  adopted  court-or-\ndered  remedial  districts  as  its  own.  The  federal  court \nthat fashioned those remedial districts did so based on a \nmandate from this Court to “draw interim maps that do \nnot  violate  the  Constitution  or  the  Voting  Rights  Act.” \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 396. Yet having drawn maps pursuant \nto  a  mandate  to  avoid  even  likely  infirmities,  the  same \ncourt deemed those same districts, once adopted as state \nlaw by the Legislature, to constitute intentional discrim-\nination on the basis of race. That conclusion “sounds ab-\nsurd, because it is.” Sekhar v. United States, 133 S. Ct. \n2720, 2727 (2013). There is not a shred of support for the \ndistrict court’s novel theory that a legislature engages in \nintentional discrimination by failing to “remove” the pur-\nported “discriminatory taint” from the court’s own maps \nbefore  embracing  them  as  its  own.  The  district  court’s \ndecision defies law and logic and cannot be sustained. \n\nI.  This  Court’s  jurisdiction  is  clear.  The  district \ncourt’s  orders  are  appealable  interlocutory  orders  be-\ncause  they  have  the  “practical  effect”  of  an  injunction. \nCarson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83 (1981). Not \nonly did those orders conclusively find the State’s 2013 \ncongressional and state-house redistricting plans unlaw-\nful; they had the immediate practical effect of precluding \nthe State from using those duly enacted maps in the up-\ncoming elections and putting the state on the clock to use \nor  lose  its  sovereign  authority  to  enact  new  maps.  The \nbest evidence of that is the district court’s extraordinary \ndirection  giving  the  Governor  just  three  days  to  recall \nthe  Legislature  or  otherwise  participate  in  the  district",
        "16 \n\ncourt’s efforts to draw new judicial maps for the impend-\ning elections. The only conceivable explanation for such \nextreme haste and such an extraordinary demand is that \nthe court had foreclosed use of the 2013 maps in the im-\npending  2018  election  cycle,  which  was  set  to  kick  off \nweeks  later.  Accordingly,  while  the  district  court  may \nhave steered clear of using the magic word “injunction,” \nthat does not obscure the fact that the court’s orders had \nthe practical effect of blocking the State from using its \nmaps in any future elections and gave the State only the \nbriefest  of  intervals  to  exercise  its  sovereign  authority \nover  redistricting,  which  is  plainly  sufficient  for  this \nCourt’s jurisdiction. \n\nII.  The central question on the merits is whether the \nTexas Legislature engaged in intentional discrimination \nwhen  it  adopted  districts  imposed  by  the  district  court \nitself. Plainly, it did not. A legislature does not engage in \nracial  gerrymandering  (or  intentional  vote  dilution)  by \nembracing,  as  its  own,  districts  that  a  federal  court or-\ndered  the  State  to  use  after  expressly  concluding  that \nthey sufficed to address every “plausible” constitutional \nor statutory objection. \n\nAll  of  the  evidence  confirms  the  commonsense  con-\nclusion that the Legislature enacted the court’s own re-\nmedial  districts  because  it  took  the  court  at  its  word \nwhen  it  concluded  that  those  maps  complied  with  the \nConstitution and the VRA and redressed every “plausi-\nble” claim otherwise. The plaintiffs’ intentional-discrimi-\nnation claims thus should have failed even without refer-\nence to the strong “presumption of good faith” and “ex-\ntraordinary caution” that applies in this context. Miller",
        "17 \n\nv. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). With that presump-\ntion, the question is not close.  \n\nThe  district  court  concluded  otherwise  based  on  its \nnovel  view  that  the  Legislature  was  required  to  prove \nthat  it  “removed”  the  “taint  of  discriminatory  intent” \nthat  purportedly  infected  the  court’s  interim  maps  be-\nfore the Legislature embraced them as its own. That rea-\nsoning is wrong at every turn. It ignores settled law es-\ntablishing  that  it  is  the  plaintiffs’  burden  to  prove  that \nthe  Legislature  invidiously  and  intentionally  sought  to \nharm minority voters because of their race, not defend-\nants’ burden to prove that the Legislature did not. It con-\nfuses  discriminatory  effect,  which  at  least  is  capable  of \nbeing carried over from one law to another, with discrim-\ninatory  intent,  which  decidedly  is  not.  The  district \ncourt’s  reasoning  even  compels  the  bizarre  conclusion \nthat  the  district  court  itself  engaged  in  intentional  dis-\ncrimination when it imposed its 2012 interim maps. And \nit is not even right on its own terms because the districts \nincorporated  in  the  district  court’s  interim  maps  were \nnot infected with discriminatory “taint” in the first place. \nAccordingly, the district court’s decision invalidating on \nracial-gerrymandering  and \nintentional-vote-dilution \ngrounds multiple districts that the Legislature adopted \nverbatim from the court’s interim maps cannot stand.  \n\nIII.  The  district  court’s  invalidation  of  one  state-\nhouse district on discriminatory-effects grounds, and its \ninvalidation on racial-gerrymandering grounds of one of \nthe  very  few  state-house  districts  that  the  Legislature \nactually changed in 2013 suffer equally fatal defects.",
        "18 \n\nAs  to  the  former,  this  Court’s  precedent  confirms \nthat  VRA  §2  requires  additional  majority-minority  dis-\ntricts to be drawn only if they are compact, have at least \na 50% minority population, and would actually perform \nin  electing  minority-preferred  candidates.  The  district \ncourt  itself  acknowledged  (as  did  the  plaintiffs)  that  it \nwas  not possible  to draw  another  performing  minority-\nopportunity district in Nueces County, which suffices to \ninvalidate  the  court’s  inexplicable  conclusion  that  the \nLegislature caused vote dilution by failing to do so.  \n\nAs  for  the  latter,  the  Legislature  altered  HD90  in \nTarrant County in 2013 because plaintiffs in this case in-\nsisted  that  the  district  must  maintain  a  Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration  majority  to  avoid  vote  dilution \nunder  VRA  §2.  The  plaintiffs  then  turned  around  and \nclaimed  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  racial  gerry-\nmandering when it responded to that specific concern by \nmaintaining  HD90’s  Spanish-surname-voter-registra-\ntion  majority.  Worse  still,  the  district  court  sustained \nthat remarkable charge on the theory that VRA-compli-\nance is just “a vague goal” that does not justify intention-\nally  drawing  a  majority-minority  district.  H.J.S.  App. \n81a. To state the obvious, a legislature does not engage \nin  impermissible  racial  gerrymandering  by  relying  on \nrace for the limited purpose of addressing a specific com-\nplaint about potential vote dilution.",
        "19 \n\nA R G UM E N T \n\nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction to Review the District \nCourt’s Orders Because They Have the “Practical \nEffect”  of  Enjoining  the  State’s  Redistricting \nPlans.  \n\nThis  Court has  jurisdiction  because the  three-judge \ndistrict  court’s  orders  constitute  interlocutory  injunc-\ntions,  which  may be  appealed  directly  to this  Court.  28 \nU.S.C. §1253. This Court has made clear that appellate \njurisdiction turns on the “practical effect” of a court’s in-\nterlocutory orders, not labels or form. Carson, 450 U.S. \nat 83. Courts thus have consistently held that “[e]ven if \nan order does not by its terms grant or deny a specific \nrequest for  an injunction  . . .  the  order  may still be  ap-\npealable if it has the ‘practical effect’ of doing so.” Sala-\nzar ex rel. Salazar v. Dist. of Columbia, 671 F.3d 1258, \n1261-62 (D.C. Cir. 2012); see, e.g., Thomas ex rel. D.M.T. \nv. Sch. Bd. St. Martin Par., 756 F.3d 380, 384 (5th Cir. \n2014);  Etuk  v.  Slattery,  936  F.2d  1433,  1440  (2d  Cir. \n1991).  Whether  a  court  labels  an  order  an  “injunction” \ntherefore  makes  no  difference;  otherwise  courts  could \nput off review of their decisions through the simple ex-\npedient of omitting magic words.  \n\nThat rule has particular force in the redistricting con-\ntext, where the next election must take place and must \ntake place  under some  map.  In  that  context, a  decision \ninvalidating the map adopted by the legislature and used \nin previous elections not only prohibits the use of those \nmaps in the upcoming elections, but implicitly or explic-\nitly puts the state government on the clock to enact a re-",
        "20 \n\nplacement map forthwith or lose its opportunity to exer-\ncise  its  sovereign  authority  over  redistricting.  Here,  of \ncourse, the district court made this explicit by giving the \nGovernor  just  three  days  to  order  a  special  session  or, \nfailing that, directing the State to participate in the judi-\ncial map-drawing process. Such a use-it-or-lose-it order \nto the sovereign has the practical effect of an injunction \nand  reinforces  that  the  order  invalidating  the  legisla-\ntively drawn maps operates as an injunction prohibiting \ntheir use in the upcoming election.  \n\nThe orders here are plainly appealable. While the dis-\ntrict court did not label its orders “injunctions,” those or-\nders had the unambiguous “practical effect” of prohibit-\ning the State from conducting any future elections under \nits  duly  enacted  redistricting  plans.  A  mere  one  month \nafter trial on these plans, the district court conclusively \nheld  that  districts  in  Plans  C235  and  H358  violate  the \nConstitution  or  the  VRA,  and  it  conclusively  held  that \nthose “statutory and constitutional violations” “now re-\nquire a remedy.” C.J.S. App. 118a; H.J.S. App. 84a (em-\nphasis added). The district court then expressly ordered \nthat, if the Legislature did not redraw both maps imme-\ndiately,  the  court  would  do  so  itself.  Indeed,  the  court \ngave  the  Governor  just  three  business  days  to  decide \nwhether  to  call  the  Legislature  into  special  session  to \ndraw new maps. And in the event the Governor declined \nto meet that court-imposed deadline, the court ordered \nthe parties to consult with map-drawing experts, confer \nwith each other, and come prepared to offer proposed re-\nmedial  plans  on  September  5  and  6,  2017.  C.J.S.  App. \n118a-119a; H.J.S. App. 86a.",
        "21 \n\nThe  reason  for  this haste  was  clear:  The  October  1, \n2017 deadline for implementing any changes to the maps \nbefore the 2018 election cycle was fast approaching, and \nthe district court wanted to ensure that it could put new \nmaps in place before that deadline arrived.7 Indeed, if the \ncourt’s orders were not intended to block the State from \nusing Plans C235 and H358 in the impending elections, \nthen there would have been no reason to put the Gover-\nnor under a three-day deadline to haul the out-of-session \nLegislature back to the Capitol on an expedited basis, or \nto order the parties to rush to redraw the maps a mere \n21 days after invalidating Plan C235 and a mere 13 days \nafter invalidating Plan H358.  \n\nThat the district court’s orders had the “practical ef-\nfect”  of  enjoining  any  future  use  of  the  maps  is  under-\nscored  by  the  court’s  response  to  the  temporary  stay \nJustice Alito granted pending completion of briefing on \nthe State’s stay applications. Rather than respond to that \norder by clarifying that it had not yet decided whether \nthe State could still use the maps in the 2018 election cy-\ncle, the district court responded by issuing an “advisory” \nencouraging the parties to continue preparing for its ex-\npedited  map-drawing  hearing  “voluntarily”  so  that  the \ncourt’s own map-drawing efforts could “be resumed ex-\npeditiously” if the stay were lifted. C.J.S. App. 425a. As \n\n7 The State had advised the court in May 2017 that the Secre-\ntary  of  State  must  provide  voter-registration-certificate  tem-\nplates to the State’s 254  counties by October 1 to  give county \nofficials  sufficient  time  to  mail  completed  certificates  to  indi-\nvidual  voters  between  November  15  and  December  6,  as  re-\nquired by Texas Election Code §14.001. See J.A. 380a-381a.",
        "22 \n\nthe district court itself thus made plain, new maps for the \nimpending  elections  were  not  just  a  possibility;  they \nwere a certainty.  \n\nThe district court’s self-serving claim that it “has not \nenjoined  [the  plans’]  use  for  any  upcoming  elections,” \nJ.A. 134a, 136a, is therefore no bar to this Court’s juris-\ndiction. No matter how the court labels its orders, they \nare  injunctions  in substance.  In  fact,  the court’s  orders \nhave the exact same practical effect—conclusively inval-\nidating districts—as the orders in numerous other redis-\ntricting appeals over which this Court has exercised ju-\nrisdiction.  See,  e.g.,  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455 \n(2017); Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161 (U.S.). The district \ncourt should not be able to deprive the State of the ability \nto seek the immediate appellate relief Congress intended \nby refusing to admit what its orders have actually done.  \nThe district court’s orders readily satisfy all other as-\npects of appealability analysis. The orders leave no doubt \nabout what has been enjoined or against whom they run. \nCf. Gunn v. Univ. Comm. to End the War in Viet Nam, \n399 U.S. 383, 388 (1970). They “affect[] predominantly all \nof the merits,” Salazar, 671 F.3d at 1262, and alter the \nstatus quo, see Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for Cent. Dist. \nof Cal., 137 F.3d 1420, 1422 n.2 (9th Cir. 1998); Cohen v. \nBd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Med. & Dentistry of N.J., 867 \nF.2d 1455, 1466 (3d Cir. 1989) (en banc). They are certain \nto  have  “serious,  perhaps  irreparable,  consequence,” \nCarson, 450 U.S. at 84, because they conclusively and im-\nmediately  invalidate  duly  enacted  redistricting  plans. \nAnd  the  orders can  be  “‘effectually  challenged’  only by",
        "23 \n\nimmediate appeal,” id., because appellate review only af-\nter the imposition of remedial maps would come too late \nto prevent the irreparable harm of being prohibited from \nusing legislatively enacted maps in the 2018 elections. In \nshort, the orders below are injunctions in everything but \nname, and as such are immediately appealable under 28 \nU.S.C. §1253. \n\nPractical considerations reinforce the appealability of \nthe  orders  under  review.  While  in  other  contexts  the \nchoice  may  be  between  orderly  review  now  or  later,  in \nthe redistricting context the choice is between relatively \norderly review by this Court after the three-judge court \nrejects the legislative map and puts the sovereign on the \nclock,  or  extremely  expedited  review  after  the  three-\njudge  court  puts  its  own  maps  in  place.  Deferring  this \nCourt’s review, as opposed to facilitating this Court’s re-\nview once the district court has definitively rejected the \nlegislative maps, has little to recommend it from a prac-\ntical  standpoint.  In  addition,  permitting  review  once  a \nthree-judge  court  definitively  rejects  the  State’s  maps \nevens the playing field. If the challengers’ objections to \nthe  legislative  map  had  been  definitively  rejected,  the \nchallengers  would  have  an  immediately  appealable  or-\nder.  But  when  the  State’s  defense  of  the  map has  been \ndefinitively rejected, appellees would have the State wait \nuntil the district court adds the word injunction to its dis-\nposition. That makes little sense, especially given the im-\nmediate interference with the State’s sovereignty when \nthe  State  is  put  on  the  clock  to  use  or  lose  its  primary \nrole over redistricting.",
        "24 \n\nII.  The Texas Legislature Did Not Engage In Inten-\ntional  Discrimination  When  It  Enacted  Districts \nImposed By The District Court Itself In 2012. \n\nThe  district  court  invalidated  Plans  C235  and  H358 \non the theory that the Legislature engaged in intentional \ndiscrimination when it adopted unchanged districts that \nthe court itself ordered the State to use in 2012 after this \nCourt instructed it to “draw interim maps that do not vi-\nolate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.” Perry, \n565 U.S. at 396. The district court did not reach that re-\nmarkable  result  because  it  identified  some  “smoking \ngun” evidence revealing that the legislature actually be-\nlieved  that  the  court’s  own  interim  maps  discriminated \nagainst  minority  voters.  Indeed,  the court  did  not  even \nconclude  that  the  Legislature  deliberately  set  out  to \ndeny  or  abridge  minority  voting  rights.  Instead,  the \ncourt  concluded  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  inten-\ntional  discrimination  by  failing  to  affirmatively  remove \n(how, the court did not explain) the “taint of discrimina-\ntory intent” that infected the court’s own remedial maps \nthat the Legislature later adopted as its own. That con-\nclusion defies law and logic.  \n\nA.  The Legislature Did Not Engage in Intentional \nDiscrimination When It Adopted the Court-Or-\ndered Districts as Its Own. \n\nAny  effort  to  invalidate  legislation  must  begin  with \nthe  “heavy  presumption”  that  the  law  is  constitutional \nand valid. U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, \n721  (1990).  That  presumption  applies  with  particular",
        "25 \n\nforce in the redistricting context. As this Court has reit-\nerated time and again, “[f]ederal-court review of district-\ning legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most \nvital of local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915, as “reap-\nportionment  is  primarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of \nthe  State,”  Chapman, 420  U.S.  at  27.  Moreover,  courts \nmust  “exercise  extraordinary  caution  in  adjudicating \nclaims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis \nof race.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. A claim that a legisla-\nture acted for a constitutionally illegitimate purpose in-\nvolves “a question of much delicacy, which ought seldom, \nif  ever,  to  be  decided  in  the  affirmative,  in  a  doubtful \ncase.” Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87, 128 (1810) \n(Marshall, C.J.). Accordingly, “the presumption of good \nfaith that must be accorded legislative enactments” ap-\nplies with the strongest of force when a legislature is ac-\ncused of enacting intentionally discriminatory redistrict-\ning legislation. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. \n\nThat  grave  accusation  is  at  the  heart  of  both  inten-\ntional-vote-dilution  and  racial-gerrymandering  claims. \nTo prove racial gerrymandering,  a  plaintiff must prove \n“that  race  was  the  predominant  factor  motivating  the \nlegislature’s decision to place a significant number of vot-\ners within or without a particular district.” Id. To prove \nintentional vote dilution, a plaintiff must prove not only \nthat the challenged law has the discriminatory “effect of \ndiluting minority voting strength,” but also that the law \nwas  enacted  for  a  “discriminatory  purpose.”  See,  e.g., \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (emphasis added). \nThe standard for demonstrating the requisite impermis-\nsible intent is appropriately high:",
        "26 \n“Discriminatory  purpose” . . .  implies  more  than  in-\ntent  as  volition  or  intent  as  awareness  of  conse-\nquences. . . . It implies that the decisionmaker . . . se-\nlected  or  reaffirmed  a particular  course  of  action  at \nleast in part “because of,” not merely “in spite of,” its \nadverse effects upon an identifiable group. \n\nPers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). \nAnd  where  there  are  “legitimate  reasons”  for  govern-\nment action, courts may “not infer a discriminatory pur-\npose.” McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 299 (1987). \n\nApplying those exacting standards, this should have \nbeen an easy case. In 2013, the Legislature chose to en-\nact districts that had been imposed by a federal court op-\nerating  under  a  mandate  from  this  Court  to  “draw  in-\nterim  maps  that  do  not  violate  the  Constitution  or  the \nVoting Rights Act.”  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  396. Abiding  by \nthat instruction, the district court imposed interim maps \nthat, by its own telling, remedied not just all actual con-\nstitutional  or  VRA  violations  in  the  2011  plans,  but  all \n“plausible legal defects” in those plans. H.J.S. App. 313a \n(emphasis  added).  And  the  court  expressly  confirmed \nthat its “interim plan . . . does not incorporate any portion \nof the State map that is allegedly tainted by discrimina-\ntory  purpose.”  H.J.S.  App.  305a;  see  also  C.J.S.  App. \n408a (“C235 is not purposefully discriminatory”).  \n\nTaking the court at its word, the Legislature repealed \nthe  2011  plans,  enacted  unchanged  the  court-ordered \nPlan C235, and enacted a House plan that made only mi-\nnor  changes  to  court-ordered  Plan  H309.  The  Legisla-\nture was not coy about its reasons for repealing the 2011 \nplans and embracing the court-ordered remedial plans as",
        "27 \n\nits own. As the record makes clear, it adopted those plans \nbecause it believed that doing so was its best chance at \nadopting plans that complied with the Constitution and \nthe  VRA  and  its  best  hope  to  bring  this  litigation  to  a \nclose. Statutory Appendix 35a-36a. \n\nFor  example,  Representative  Darby,  the  Chairman \nof the House Select Committee on Redistricting, opined \n“that  the  court  ordered  interim  maps  are  legally  suffi-\ncient,”  explaining  that  they  “represent  the  District \nCourt’s best judgment as to . . . fully legal and constitu-\ntional  redistricting  plans.”  2017  Joint  Ex.  10.4  at  5,  26. \nRepresentative  Clardy,  another  member  of  the  House \ncommittee, explained: “[I]t’s a good, fair map drawn by \nthree  hard-working  impartial  federal  judges  who  are \nvery  well  acquainted  with  the  law.  Don’t  you  think  it’s \nreasonable that we use . . . those maps?” 2017 Joint Ex. \n13.4 at 151. Senator Seliger, the Chairman of the Senate \nRedistricting  Committee,  likewise  stated,  “The  interim \nplans  remedy,  we  believe,  the  legal  flaws  found  in  the \nfederal court in D.C.” 2017 Joint Ex. 26.2 at A-5. And the \nLegislature  enacted  the  court-ordered  maps  following \nthe Attorney General’s advice that “the best way to rem-\nedy the violations found by the D.C. court is to adopt the \ncourt-drawn interim plans as the State’s permanent re-\ndistricting maps.” C.J.S. App. 432a.  \n\nThese  myriad  state  officials  certainly  had  a  good-\nfaith basis for that belief. After all, it is hard to imagine \nmore persuasive evidence that a map complies with the \nConstitution and the VRA than a district court order ex-\nplicitly finding, consistent with this Court’s instruction in",
        "28 \n\nPerry, that the map does not incorporate any “plausible \nlegal defects.” H.J.S. App. 313a.  \n\nBut that was not even the only assurance the Legis-\nlature  had.  The  Legislature  heard  corroborating  testi-\nmony  from  the  Mexican-American  Legal  Defense  and \nEducational  Fund  (MALDEF),  an  organization  repre-\nsenting  multiple  plaintiffs  in  this  case.  MALDEF  ex-\nplained  how  the  court-ordered  plans  “significantly  im-\nprove[d]”  minority  voting  strength  by  changing  every \ndistrict in which the D.C. preclearance court had found \nintentional  discrimination  under  VRA  §5  and  creating \neven  more  majority-minority  districts  than  that  court \nhad  found  necessary  to  avoid  retrogression.  See  C.J.S. \nApp. 436a-439a.  \n\nDemocratic legislators testified at trial that they had \nno reason to believe that any member of the 2013 Legis-\nlature  acted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose.  Mexican \nAmerican  Legislative  Caucus  (MALC)  Chairman  and \nRepresentative  Rafael  Anchia  testified  that  he  had  no \nbasis  to  say  that  any  member  of  the  Legislature  voted \nfor  Plan  H358  for  a  racially  discriminatory  purpose,  or \nthat  Chairman  Darby or  Speaker  Straus  would  engage \nin  racial  discrimination.  2017  Trial  Tr.  133-34.  In  fact, \nRepresentative  Anchia  testified  that  even  he  did  not \nhave  any  complaints  about  Plans  C235  or  H358  when \nthey were enacted. Id. at 720-21.  \n\nAll  of  that  evidence  readily  suffices  to  defeat  any \nclaim  that  the  Legislature  enacted  the  court-imposed \nmaps into law in a deliberate effort to sort voters on the \nbasis of race, Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, or “because of” any \n“adverse effects” that the plans might have on minority",
        "29 \n\nvoters, Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. To the contrary, the rec-\nord overwhelmingly confirms that the most straightfor-\nward  answer  is  the right  one:  The  Legislature  adopted \nthe court-ordered interim plans in an effort to enact re-\ndistricting  plans  that  complied  with  the  VRA  and  the \nConstitution. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ intentional-vote-di-\nlution and racial-gerrymandering claims would fail even \nwithout  reference  to  the  strong  “presumption  of  good \nfaith” that applies in this context, or the “extraordinary \ncaution” federal courts must employ when faced with a \nclaim that a state legislature has engaged in intentional \nrace-based  discrimination.  Miller,  515  U.S.  at  916.  But \nwith  those  admonitions,  their  claims  should never  have \nstood a chance. \n\nB.  The  District  Court’s  “Remove  the  Taint”  The-\nory  of  Intentional  Discrimination  Is  Funda-\nmentally Flawed. \n\nNotwithstanding  that  uncontroverted  evidence,  the \ndistrict court reached the remarkable conclusion that the \nLegislature engaged in intentional discrimination when \nit adopted as its own the same plans that the court itself \nordered the State to use in the 2012 elections. The court \ninvalidated  two  congressional  districts  and  state-house \ndistricts in three counties that had been adopted verba-\ntim from its own remedial maps—even though the court \nhad  expressly  considered  the  very  same  constitutional \nand VRA challenges to the very same districts five years \nearlier and found that they were unlikely to succeed, ad-\nequately  addressed  in  the  interim  plans,  or  not  even \n“plausible.” H.J.S. App. 313a; C.J.S. App. 423a.",
        "30 \n\nUnsurprisingly  given  the  record  evidence,  the  dis-\ntrict court did not actually find that the Legislature was \npredominantly  motivated  by  race  when  it  embraced \nthose districts as its own, or that the Legislature enacted \nany  of  those  districts  for  the  express  purpose  of  ad-\nversely affecting minority voters. The court never even \nasked  what  the  Legislature’s  predominant  motive  was, \nor whether it embraced any districts because they would \nharm minority voters. Instead, the court concluded that \nthe Legislature engaged in “intentional discrimination” \nfor  a  different  reason  entirely:  because  it  failed  to  “re-\nmove”  the  purported  “discriminatory  taint”  from  the \ncourt-imposed plans. C.J.S. App. 46a. In other words, the \ncourt  concluded that  the  Legislature  engaged  in inten-\ntional discrimination by enacting plans imposed by the \ncourt itself because those court-imposed plans were pur-\nportedly infected with intentional discrimination. That \nconclusion  suffers  multiple  legal  defects  and  flunks  the \ncommonsense test to boot.  \n\nThe first fatal problem with the district court’s rea-\nsoning is that it vitiates the strong “presumption of good \nfaith” and the “extraordinary caution” courts must em-\nploy  when  confronting  intentional-vote-dilution  and  ra-\ncial-gerrymandering claims. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. The \n2013  plans  are  duly  enacted  legislation  entitled  to  the \nsame presumption of constitutionality that applies to any \nother  redistricting  legislation.  That  presumption  does \nnot disappear just because those were not the first maps \nthe  Legislature  enacted,  or  because  the  district  court \nfound the Legislature’s previous maps deficient (albeit in \nan advisory opinion on moot claims, see infra pp. 42-44).",
        "31 \n\nThat is clear from this Court’s repeated admonitions that \ncourts must “afford a reasonable opportunity for the leg-\nislature to” remedy an invalid law “by adopting a substi-\ntute  measure,”  Wise  v.  Lipscomb,  437  U.S.  535,  540 \n(1978)  (principal  op.)  (emphasis  added),  because  redis-\ntricting is always “primarily the duty and responsibility \nof  the  State,”  Chapman,  420  U.S.  at  27;  see  also,  e.g., \nGrowe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 34 (1993). That rule would \nbe  meaningless  if  “remedial”  redistricting  legislation \nwere treated as presumptively suspect and not entitled \nto the same presumptions of constitutionality and good \nfaith as any other redistricting legislation. \n\nintentional-vote-dilution: \n\nThe  district  court’s  task  here  thus  should  have  re-\nmained the same as in any other case alleging racial-ger-\nto  ask \nrymandering  and \nwhether the plaintiffs proved that the Legislature inten-\ntionally  sorted  voters  on  the  basis  of  race,  Miller,  515 \nU.S. at 916, or enacted the map “because of” its “adverse \neffects” on minority voters, Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. By \ninstead  requiring  the  Legislature  to  prove  that  it  “re-\nmoved”  purported  discriminatory  taint  from  an  earlier \nmap, the court not only asked the wrong questions, but \nreversed the burden of proof entirely. \n\nWhile that alone is reason to reject the district court’s \nanalysis, it is just the first of many problems with requir-\ning the Legislature to prove that it “removed” the pur-\nported “discriminatory taint” of earlier legislation. C.J.S. \nApp. 46a. That reasoning suffers from the equally funda-\nmental  problem  that  it  is  incoherent.  It  is  one  thing  to \nask whether new legislation removes the discriminatory \neffects of previous legislation, for effects may be carried",
        "32 \n\nover (wittingly or unwittingly) from one version of a law \nto  another.  But  it  makes  no  sense  whatsoever  to  ask \nwhether new legislation removes the “taint” of discrimi-\nnatory intent from an earlier enactment. C.J.S. App. 46a.  \nOutside of cases of express, facial discrimination, dis-\ncriminatory intent is not indelibly ingrained in statutory \ntext  or  lines  on  a  map.  It  is  a  question  of  motive  that \nturns on why the legislature enacted the law. The prem-\nise of such claims is that a different legislature could per-\nmissibly adopt the same legislation without a discrimina-\ntory motive. See, e.g., Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, \n225 (1971) (noting that a law invalidated because of im-\nproper motive “would presumably be valid as soon as the \nlegislature  or  relevant  governing  body  repassed  it  for \ndifferent  reasons”).  Thus,  when  a  different  legislature \nadopts  a  court-drawn  map  with  a  different,  non-racial \nmotive, any talk of removing taint from the court-drawn \nplan  (or  the  earlier  legislative  act  on  which  the  court-\ndrawn map was based) is a non sequitur. \n\nThat is clear from the very case on which the district \ncourt  relied  in  concluding  otherwise.  Hunter  v.  Under-\nwood,  471  U.S.  222  (1985),  involved  a  statute  that  had \nbeen in effect unchanged for more than 80 years and ad-\nmittedly had been “motivated by a desire to discriminate \nagainst blacks on account of race” when enacted. Id. at \n233.  While  the  Court  invalidated  the  statute  on  inten-\ntional-discrimination  grounds,  the  Court  expressly  re-\nserved the question of whether the same law “would be \nvalid if enacted today without any impermissible motiva-\ntion.” Id. The Court not only viewed itself as reserving, \nrather  than  deciding,  that  question,  but  did  so  without",
        "33 \n\nsuggesting a need for some kind of exorcism to remove \nthe discriminatory intent of an earlier legislature.8   \n\nMoreover, the 2013 maps were not only enacted by a \ndifferent  legislature  than  the  2011  maps,  but  were \nadopted  after  the  intervening  effort  of  the  three-judge \ncourt enforcing this Court’s mandate to remedy any con-\nstitutional problems. Thus, whatever intentions the 2011 \nLegislature may have harbored, those intentions cannot \nplausibly be deemed to have carried over to the plans im-\nposed by the district court itself just because those plans \ndid not change each and every aspect of the 2011 plans. \nIndeed, by that logic, the court itself must have engaged \nin intentional discrimination when it imposed Plans C235 \nand H309, as the court was just as guilty of failing to “re-\nmove” any lingering “taint” in the 2011 plans as the 2013 \nLegislature was.  \n\nAll of that just goes to show the incoherence that re-\nsults  from  the  district  court’s  approach.  Any  legal  test \nthat leads to the bizarre result that a legislature engaged \nin intentional discrimination by enacting court-imposed \nmaps designed to remedy discrimination cannot possibly \nbe right. After all, there must be some way for a legisla-\n\n8 The Fifth Circuit cases  on which the  district court  relied  do \nnot  support  its  position  either.  To  the  contrary,  those  cases \nreinforce  the  conclusion  that  the  only  intent  that  matters  is \nthe  intent  of  the  legislature  that  adopts  the  challenged  law. \nSee,  e.g.,  Cotton  v.  Fordice,  157  F.3d  388,  391  (5th  Cir.  1998) \n(finding  new  version  of  law  comparable  to  law  invalidated  in \nHunter  constitutional  because,  inter  alia,  legislature  did  not \nenact it for a discriminatory purpose).",

Bush  v.  Vera,  517 \nU.S.  952,  977  (1996)  (plurality  opinion).  If  adopting  a \ncourt-imposed interim plan that the court itself declared \nsufficient  to  remedy  all  “plausible  legal  defects”  under \neither  the  Constitution  or  the  VRA  does  not  suffice, \nH.J.S.  App.  313a,  then  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  what \ncould.  \n\nIn fact, the district court’s opinions tellingly provide \nno  clue  as  to  what  the  court  believed  the  Legislature \ncould or should have done to remove the supposed “taint” \nfrom  the  court-ordered  plans.  To  the  contrary,  the \ncourt’s own analysis confirms that, in its view, there was \nnothing  the  2013  Legislature  could  do  to  remove  the \n“taint.” There is no better illustration of that once-bitten-\nforever-damned  mentality  than  the  court’s  analysis  of \nHD90.  Unlike  any  of  the  other  districts  from  the  2013 \nmaps that the court invalidated, HD90 actually was re-\ndrawn by the 2013 Legislature. And the district court ex-\npressly held that the plaintiffs’ intentional-vote-dilution \nchallenge to the redrawn HD90 “fails because of a lack of \ndiscriminatory intent.” H.J.S. App. 84a. Yet, even though \nthe  court  expressly  found  that  the  plaintiffs  failed  to \nshow  that  the  2013  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional \ndiscrimination  as  to  HD90,  the  court  still  found  that \nHD90  was  “tainted”  by  the  purported  intentional  dis-\ncrimination of the 2011 Legislature. H.J.S. App. 83a. As \nthat  confirms,  the  district  court’s  “remove-the-taint”",
        "35 \n\ntheory  not  only  has no  basis in  law  or  logic, but is  ulti-\nmately impossible for a legislature to satisfy. Thus, just \nlike six years ago, the district court here was determined \nto impose “independent map[s]” based on its particular \nview of “the interest of the collective public good.” Perry, \n565 U.S. at 396. \n\nC.  The District Court Did Not and Could Not Find \nIntentional  Discrimination  on  the  Basis  of \nRace. \n\nUnder a correct application of the correct legal stand-\nards, the district court had no basis to conclude that the \nLegislature engaged in racial gerrymandering or inten-\ntional vote dilution when it adopted the court’s remedial \nmaps as its own. In concluding otherwise, the court relied \nprincipally on its view that the Legislature enacted the \ncourt-imposed plans “as part of a litigation strategy,” ra-\nther than because it had “a change of heart concerning \nthe validity of any of Plaintiffs’ claims in either this liti-\ngation or the D.C. Court litigation.” C.J.S. App. 40a, 41a. \nThat is  both  factually misguided  and  legally irrelevant, \nas  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  whether  the  Legislature \nsorted voters on the basis of race or intentionally diluted \nminority voting strength.  \n\nAt the outset, the district court’s characterization of \nthe  Legislature  is  difficult  to  reconcile  with  the  uncon-\ntested evidence that the Legislature adopted the court-\nordered plans because it believed that they remedied any \nvalid  legal  claims. See supra p.27.  Moreover,  to  the ex-\ntent the court sought to attribute impermissible motive \nto the Legislature because defendants have defended the \n2011 maps in litigation, see C.J.S. App. 42a (“Defendants",
        "36 \n\nsought  to  avoid  any  liability  for  the  2011  plans . . . .”), \nthat not only is wrong as matter of fact, but would seem \nto  suggest  that the  very  act  of  defending  allegedly  dis-\ncriminatory  legislation  would  itself  constitute  discrimi-\nnation—a  result  that  is  not  and  cannot  be  the  law,  and \nthat would raise serious due process concerns if it were. \nBut more fundamentally, it is not clear how a legisla-\nture  can  endeavor  to  avoid  potential  VRA  challenges \nwithout considering “litigation strategy.” Nor is it clear \nwhy there is anything remotely sinister, let alone uncon-\nstitutional, about a legislature trying to bring existing lit-\nigation  to  an  end.  A  legislature  that  did  not  take  such \nconsiderations into account to any degree, especially in a \ncontext as fraught with litigation as redistricting, would \nbe  a  poor  steward  of  the  public  interest.  There  is  thus \nnothing  constitutionally  suspect  about  repealing  a  law \nthat has come under constitutional and statutory attack \nand replacing it with a law that likely remedies any per-\nceived legal deficiencies and is therefore likely to termi-\nnate or at least abbreviate ongoing litigation. To the con-\ntrary,  that  is  precisely  the  kind  of  conciliatory  and  re-\nsource-saving  action  that  courts  (and  plaintiffs)  should \nencourage  legislatures  to  take.  See,  e.g.,  Am.  Library \nAss’n  v.  Barr,  956  F.2d  1178,  1187  (D.C.  Cir.  1992) \n(“passing  legislation  designed  to  repair  what  may  have \nbeen a constitutionally defective statute . . . represents \nresponsible lawmaking, not manipulation of the judicial \nprocess”).  \n\nAnd it would make no sense whatsoever to require a \nlegislature  to  confess  the  purported  error  of  its  past \nways—let  alone  confess  the  purported  error  of  a  past",
        "37 \n\nlegislature’s past ways—before treating the decision to \naccede to a court-ordered remedy as the conciliatory act \nthat it is. Much litigation settles without an admission of \nwrongdoing, and forcing a legislature to cry not only “un-\ncle,” but “mea culpa,” is unrealistic and counterproduc-\ntive, not to mention legally unfounded.   \n\nIn  all  events,  even  assuming  there  were  something \nuntoward about embracing a court-ordered remedy “as \npart  of  a  litigation  strategy,”  C.J.S.  App.  40a,  that  has \nnothing to do with racial gerrymandering or intentional \nvote  dilution.  Racial  gerrymandering  turns  on  whether \n“race was the predominant factor motivating the legisla-\nture’s  decision  to  place  a  significant  number  of  voters \nwithin or without a particular district.” Miller, 515 U.S. \nat 916. Intentional vote dilution turns on whether the leg-\nislature enacted a particular district because it intended \nto dilute minority voting strength. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. at 641. A legislature does not act with either of those \nimpermissible race-based motivations just because it en-\nacts a court-ordered remedy out of a desire to end litiga-\ntion over whether a different legislature acted with im-\npermissible purpose when enacting different legislation.   \nThe district court seemed to think otherwise because \nit was convinced that the Legislature believed that it had \nsomehow “insulate[d]” the 2013 maps from all legal chal-\nlenges.  C.J.S.  App.  41a.  That  is  simply  wrong.  Defend-\nants do not contend, and have never contended, that the \n2013 maps are immune from judicial review. Their con-\ntention is that any intentional-discrimination challenges \nto  those  maps  must  be  based  on  the  intentions  of  the",
        "38 \n\nLegislature  that  enacted  them—i.e.,  the  2013  Legisla-\nture,  not  the  2011  Legislature—and  must  be  judged \nagainst  the  same presumption  of good  faith,  and  under \nthe  same  “predominant  motive”  and  “because  of  race” \nstandards,  that  would  apply  to  any  other  racial-gerry-\nmandering and intentional-vote-dilution claims. It is the \ndistrict  court’s  failure  to  abide  by  those  settled  legal \nprinciples, not its decision to subject the maps to any ju-\ndicial review at all, with which defendants take issue.  \n\nThe  district  court  made  much  the  same  mistake  in \nplacing great weight on the fact that its decision impos-\ning the interim maps was only preliminary. C.J.S. App. \n42a. That is certainly correct, as the court could not issue \na final ruling on the merits of any claims asserted against \nthe 2011 maps because those maps had not obtained VRA \n§5 preclearance. Not only were the 2011 maps repealed \nin  2013,  but  they  never  even  became  law  because  they \nwere never precleared, and thus “could not cause appel-\nlees  injury  through  enforcement  or  implementation.” \nBranch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 284 (2003) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring); Connor v. Waller, 421 U.S. 656, 656 (1975) \n(per curiam) (holding that challenged acts “are not now \nand will not be effective as laws until and unless cleared \npursuant to § 5”).  \n\nBut the fact that the court’s decision was not final is \nirrelevant  to  the  intentional-discrimination  question. \nAgain,  defendants  are  not  arguing  that  plaintiffs’  chal-\nlenges to the 2013 plans are flatly barred through some \nsort  of  law-of-the-case  or  estoppel  theory.  Defendants \nsimply  argue  that  the  motivations  of  the  2013  Legisla-",
        "39 \n\nture must be assessed in light of the fact that the Legis-\nlature enacted the 2013 plans only after the district court \nissued  a  decision  explaining  in  exhaustive  detail  why  it \nbelieved  that  those  court-imposed  maps  remedied  all \n“plausible  legal  defects”  in  the  2011  plans.  H.J.S.  App. \n313a. Surely the Legislature could rely in good faith on \nthat  decision  even  though  it  was  preliminary—particu-\nlarly  given  that  the  decision  came  after  the  court  held \ntwo  weeks  of  trial,  received  explicit  instructions  from \nthis Court, considered extensive briefing before and af-\nter this Court’s decision, and heard on remand two addi-\ntional days of argument from all interested parties. \n\nFinally, the district court truly devolved to absurdity \nwhen it criticized the Legislature’s “refusal to consider” \ncreating “coalition” districts9 or violating the Texas Con-\nstitution’s  whole-county  provision10  in  certain  areas. \nC.J.S. App.  40a.  The  court  itself  rejected  the  plaintiffs’ \nclaims  that  the  Legislature  discriminated  by  failing  to \ncreate  coalition  districts  because  the  plaintiffs  failed  to \nprove cohesion between African-American and Hispanic \n\n9 A “coalition” district is a district in which two or more minor-\nity groups must be combined to form a majority of eligible vot-\ners. See, e.g., Perry, 565 U.S. at 398. A “crossover” district, by \ncontrast, is “one in which minority voters make up less than a \nmajority  of  the  voting-age  population”  but  may  nevertheless \nelect  their  preferred  candidates  because  enough  members  of \nthe  majority  “cross  over  to  support  the  minority’s  preferred \ncandidate.” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13 (2009).  \n\n10 Tex. Const. art. III, §26.",
        "40 \n\nvoters.11  C.J.S.  App.  117a;  H.J.S.  App.  12a,  26a.  And  it \nexpressly  declined  to  hold  that  VRA  §2  compelled  the \nLegislature  to  violate  the  whole-county  provision.  See \nH.J.S. App. 50a. The Legislature cannot plausibly have \nengaged  in  intentional  discrimination  by  declining  to \ndraw districts that the court itself concluded were not ac-\ntually required by the VRA. The court’s seeming belief \notherwise  is  at  considerable  odds  with  the  skepticism \nthis Court has expressed “of a claim that seeks to invali-\ndate  a  statute  based  on  a  legislature’s  unlawful  motive \nbut does so without reference to the content of the legis-\nlation  enacted.”  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  418 \n(2006). \n\nAt bottom, the district court reached the wrong result \nbecause it asked the wrong question. What matters is not \n\n11  This  was  undoubtedly  correct,  but  the  district  court’s  hold-\ning that the VRA may require coalition districts is unfounded. \nSee  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  399  (“If  the  District  Court  did  set  out \nto  create  a  minority  coalition  district,  rather  than  drawing  a \ndistrict that simply reflected population growth, it had no ba-\nsis  for  doing  so.  Cf.  Bartlett  v.  Strickland,  556  U.S.  1,  13–15 \n(2009) (plurality opinion).”); Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 15 (“Nothing \nin  §2  grants  special  protection  to  a  minority  group’s  right  to \nform  political  coalitions.”).  The  district  court’s  own  opinions \nconfirm that coalition districts present the same practical and \nconstitutional pitfalls that led this Court to hold that VRA §2 \ndoes  not  require  crossover  districts.  See  id.  at  17  (explaining \nthat  crossover-district  claims  “would  place  courts  in  the  un-\ntenable position of predicting many political variables and ty-\ning them to race-based assumptions”); cf. C.J.S. App. 53a-85a \n(considering  extensive  analysis  of  racial  voting  patterns  by \nmultiple  experts  to  determine  political  cohesion  among  Afri-\ncan-American and Hispanic voters).",
        "41 \n\nwhether the 2013 Legislature “removed the taint” from \nthe  court-ordered interim  maps before  it  enacted  them \nas its own, but rather whether the 2013 Legislature en-\nacted  those  maps  in  an  avowed  effort  to  sort  voters  on \nthe basis of race, or because they would dilute minority \nvoting strength. Particularly given the strong presump-\ntion  of  good  faith,  and  the  extraordinary  caution  that \ncourts must exercise before concluding that a legislature \nengaged  in  intentional  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \nrace, there is no plausible basis from which a court could \nconclude on this record that the Legislature engaged in \nracial gerrymandering or intentional vote dilution when \nit embraced court-imposed districts as its own. \nIII. The  Court-Imposed  Plans  Were  Not  Infected  By \n\nAny “Taint” Of Intentional Discrimination.  \n\nBecause the Texas Legislature did not engage in in-\ntentional  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race  when  it \nadopted the district court’s remedial maps as its own in \n2013, the question whether the 2011 Legislature engaged \nin  intentional  discrimination  when  it  enacted  the  long-\nago-repealed 2011 maps is both moot and legally irrele-\nvant. That said, there was no intentional discrimination \nreflected in any district in the court-ordered plans. The \ndistrict  court’s  interim  plans  preserved  the  challenged \ndistricts  from  the  2011  maps  because  the  court  recog-\nnized then what it should have recognized again in 2017: \nthose  districts  were  not  “tainted”  with  any  discrimina-\ntion in the first place.",
        "42 \n\nA.  The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction to Adju-\ndicate Moot Challenges to the 2011 Plans. \n\nThe  district  court’s  conclusion  that  the  2013  plans \nwere  infected  with  lingering  “taint”  in  need  of  “cleans-\ning”  rests  entirely  on  advisory  opinions  that  the  court \nhad no authority to enter. Article III requires that “an \nactual controversy . . . be extant at all stages of review, \nnot merely at the time the complaint is filed.” Arizonans \nfor  Official  English  v.  Arizona,  520  U.S.  43,  67  (1997). \nAnd where, as here, a lawsuit challenges the validity of a \nstatute, the controversy ceases to exist if the statute is \nrepealed. E.g., Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, \n477 (1990). If a challenged statute no longer exists, then \nabsent unusual circumstances not present here there is \nno  cognizable  controversy  over that  law,  and  any  cases \nchallenging  it  must  be  dismissed  as  moot.  See,  e.g., \nGrowe, 507 U.S. at 30; Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 \n(1987);  Diffenderfer  v.  Cent.  Baptist  Church  of  Miami, \nFla., Inc., 404 U.S. 412, 414-15 (1972) (per curiam). \n\nApplying that settled rule, a unanimous panel of the \nFifth  Circuit—in  an  opinion  authored  by  Judge  Hig-\nginson  and  joined  by  Chief  Judge  Stewart  and  Judge \nJones—held that claims against Texas’s 2011 redistrict-\ning plans “became moot” when the 2013 Legislature “re-\npealed the 2011 plan and adopted the district court’s in-\nterim  plan  in  its  place.”  Davis  v.  Abbott,  781  F.3d  207, \n220 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 534 (2015). Here, \ntoo,  as  Judge  Smith  recognized  in  dissent,  plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the 2011 plans should have been dismissed \nas  moot  once  those  plans  were  repealed.  C.J.S.  App. \n336a-349a. In fact, certain Appellees have acknowledged",
        "43 \n\nthat  “any  challenge  to  the  continued  use  of  Plan  H283 \nwould be moot.” MALC Motion to Dismiss or Affirm 1, \nAbbott v. Perez, No. 17-626 (Nov. 29, 2017).  \n\nAs explained above, the district court never acquired \njurisdiction to enter judgment on the merits of the chal-\nlenges to the 2011 plans because those plans were never \nprecleared. See supra p.38. But in all events, those claims \ncertainly  should  have been  dismissed  once  the  Legisla-\nture repealed them—a reality that the district court it-\nself acknowledged when it stated that it would “evaluate \nthe discriminatory effect of Plan C185 in terms of its ef-\nfect  on  voters  had  it  been  used.”  C.J.S.  App.  265  n.97 \n(emphasis added).  \n\nThe district court did not and could not claim that any \nexceptions  to  mootness  apply.  This  does  not  fall  within \nthe voluntary-cessation exception, as the Legislature did \nnot announce its intention to reenact “precisely the same \nprovision” once litigation ends, City of Mesquite v. Alad-\ndin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982), or to replace \nthe  2011  plans  with  “virtually  identical”  ones,  Ne.  Fla. \nChapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of \nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 661 (1993). Just the opposite: \nthe  district  court  found  that  the  Legislature  “has  re-\npealed the 2011 plans and does not intend to implement \nthem.”  J.A.  64a  (emphasis  added).  Plus,  given  the  pre-\nsumption of good faith and constitutionality, e.g., Miller, \n515 U.S. at 916, a government’s decision to formally re-\npeal legislation is not viewed with the same “critical eye” \nfor mootness purposes as a private party’s mere change \nin litigation position, Knox v. SEIU, Local 1000, 567 U.S. \n298, 307 (2012).",
        "44 \n\nFinally, the plaintiffs’ request for preclearance “bail-\nin” under VRA §3(c) does not change the analysis. Pre-\nclearance is a remedy, not a claim or an injury. The right \nto a remedy does not arise until the plaintiff prevails on \na claim, and thus cannot substitute for Article III injury. \nSee Vermont Agency of Nat. Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, \n529 U.S. 765, 773 (2000) (“an interest that is merely a ‘by-\nproduct’ of the suit itself cannot give rise to a cognizable \ninjury in fact for Article III standing purposes”). Accord-\ningly, to seek bail-in, a plaintiff must first prevail on the \nmerits of a constitutional claim that satisfies Article III’s \ncase-or-controversy requirement. Here, any threat of in-\njury from the 2011 redistricting plans disappeared when \nthe  Legislature  repealed  them.  The  plaintiffs’  request \nthat  the  district  court  reimpose  preclearance  on  the \nState  under  VRA  §3(c)  thus  could  not  keep  their  moot \nchallenges  to  the  repealed  2011  plans  alive.  It  could \nhardly be otherwise: bail-in is a remedy that, if ordered, \nsubjects a state to special rules that undermine its sov-\nereignty;  litigation  to  determine  whether  bail-in  is  ap-\npropriate would be question-begging if the litigation it-\nself subjected a state to special rules that undermined its \nsovereignty.  \n\nIn  sum,  the  district  court  never  had  jurisdiction  to \nforce the State to spend four years defending legislation \nthat was repealed in 2013. Its insistence on doing so was \njust part and parcel of the court’s erroneous and incoher-\nent effort to saddle the State with the burden of proving \nthat the court’s own interim maps removed any lingering \n“taint of discriminatory intent.”",
        "45 \n\nB.  The  Court-Imposed  Maps  Were  Not  “Tainted” \n\nby Intentional Discrimination. \n\nEven setting aside the jurisdictional problem, the dis-\ntrict  court’s  conclusions  regarding  the  invalidated  dis-\ntricts that were also in the 2011 plans are simply wrong. \nIndeed,  the  district  court itself  correctly  rejected  all  of \nthose claims in 2012 when it incorporated those districts \nin  the  interim  plans,  and  the  majority  should  have  fol-\nlowed Judge Smith’s lead in doing so again in 2017.  \n\n1.  CD35 Is Not and Never Was a Racial Gerryman-\n\nder. \n\nTo  prevail  on  a  racial-gerrymandering  claim,  the \nplaintiff must prove that race was “the ‘predominant fac-\ntor’  motivating  the  legislature’s  districting  decision.” \nHunt  v.  Cromartie,  526  U.S.  541,  547  (1999).  If  race  is \nproven  to  be  the  predominant  motive,  then  strict  scru-\ntiny applies. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464. The State satis-\nfies strict scrutiny if it had a “strong basis in evidence” \nto believe that the VRA required it to draw an additional \nminority opportunity district. Id. “[T]he requisite strong \nbasis  in  evidence  exists  when  the  legislature  has  ‘good \nreasons to believe’ it must use race in order to satisfy the \nVoting  Rights  Act.”  Bethune-Hill  v.  Va.  State  Bd.  of \nElections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 801 (2015) (quoting Ala. Legis. \nBlack Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1274 (2015)). \nOf course, the plaintiffs’ racial-gerrymandering chal-\nlenge to CD35 fails at the outset because “the 2013 Leg-\nislature  did  not  draw  the  challenged  districts  in  Plan \nC235.” C.J.S. App. 34a; id. at 115a-116a (“There is no ev-\nidence  that  the  Legislature  again  considered  in  2013",
        "46 \n\nwhich persons to include within CD35 . . . .”). But even \nassuming  for  the  sake  of  argument  that  race  predomi-\nnated when the 2011 Legislature drew CD35, both its de-\ncision to draw CD35 and the 2013 Legislature’s decision \nto enact a court-ordered plan that retained CD35 would \nreadily survive strict-scrutiny review. The 2013 Legisla-\nture had the best possible basis to believe that retaining \nCD35 was necessary to comply with VRA §2: The district \ncourt itself concluded as much in 2012. C.J.S. App. 423a.  \nCD35  is  a  Hispanic-opportunity  district  that  runs \nalong the Interstate-35 growth corridor between Austin \nand  San  Antonio.  The  configuration  of  the  district  was \nproposed by MALDEF, C.J.S. Supp. App. 315a, and sup-\nported  by  the  Texas  Latino  Redistricting  Task  Force \nplaintiffs, C.J.S. App. 174a, based on their position (not \ndisputed  by  any  plaintiff)  that  VRA  §2  requires  seven \nHispanic-opportunity districts in south and west Texas, \nsee Mot. to Dismiss or Affirm 30, Abbott v. Perez, No. 17-\n586  (Nov.  20,  2017).  Democratic  politicians  also  sup-\nported creating a Hispanic-opportunity district connect-\ning  Austin  with  San  Antonio.  Among  others,  former \nTexas Senators Gonzalo Barrientos and Joe Bernal tes-\ntified  that  CD35  “connects  communities  of  interest,” \nC.J.S. Supp. App. 321a, and that “people in those parts \nof San Antonio [covered by CD35] have more in common \nwith people in southeast Austin than with people in more \naffluent areas of San Antonio such as Alamo Heights (in \nCD21).” Id.  \n\nAfter  considering  the  plaintiffs’  claims  in  2012,  the \ndistrict  court  explained  that  Plan  C235  sufficiently  ad-",
        "47 \n\ndressed the plaintiffs’ claim that VRA §2 required “7 La-\ntino opportunity districts in South/Central/West Texas” \nby  including  seven  such  districts—one  of  which  was \nCD35.  C.J.S.  App.  423a.  The  court  also  acknowledged \nthat  the  Legislature  had  good  reasons  to  create  a  new \ndistrict along the Interstate-35 growth corridor, finding \nit  “undisputed  that  much  of  Texas’s  overall  population \ngrowth occurred in Bexar County and Travis County and \nareas along the I-35 corridor.” C.J.S. App. 408a; see also \nJoel Kotkin, America’s Next Great Metropolis Is Taking \nShape \n2016), \nhttps://perma.cc/VLM7-KMV8 (noting that the I-35 cor-\nridor  “is expanding  more  rapidly  than  any  other in  the \nnation,” and that “no regional economy . . . has more mo-\nmentum than the one that straddles the 74 miles between \nSan Antonio and Austin”).  \n\nIn  Texas,  Forbes \n\n(Oct. \n\n13, \n\nThe  district  court  nevertheless  found  in  2017  that \nCD35  was  racially  gerrymandered,  reasoning  that  be-\ncause  there  is  no  racial  bloc  voting  in  Travis  County \n(part, but not all, of which is included in CD35), VRA §2 \ncould not require the Legislature to include any part of \nTravis County in a minority-opportunity district. C.J.S. \nApp.  176a-177a.12  That  conclusion  cannot  be  reconciled \n\n12  The  district  court  noted  that  CD35  included  territory  in \nTravis County that had been in the former CD25, a crossover \ndistrict.  But  the  court  did  not  find  vote  dilution  based  on  the \nelimination of a preexisting crossover district. See C.J.S. App. \n110a n.83. Nor could it have, as most of the Travis County His-\npanic population in the previous crossover district was placed \nin  CD35,  a  new  Hispanic-opportunity  district,  so  this  popula-\ntion could not possibly have suffered vote dilution.",
        "48 \n\nwith this Court’s precedent, which required the district \ncourt  to  consider  the  entire  territory  covered  by  CD35 \nas drawn rather than a specific county, part of which is \nnot in the district at issue. See Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. \nat 800 (“The ultimate object of the inquiry . . . is . . . the \ndistrict as a whole.”). Moreover, strict scrutiny does not \nrequire a showing that the VRA in fact required the Leg-\nislature to create the district exactly as drawn; instead, \nit is enough that the Legislature had “good reasons” to \nbelieve  that  the  VRA  required  it.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at \n1464.  \n\nHere, the district court itself concluded in 2012 that \nthe  creation  of  CD35  as  a  minority-opportunity district \nwas necessary to address the Task Force plaintiffs’ VRA \n§2 claims. See C.J.S. App. 409a, 415a, 423a. If the district \ncourt had “good reasons” to believe that CD35 needed to \nbe  drawn  as  a  minority-opportunity  district  to  address \npotential VRA §2 claims, then surely the Legislature did \ntoo. If a Legislature cannot maintain a minority-oppor-\ntunity  district  even  when  a  federal  court  has  expressly \nconcluded that doing so is necessary to remedy a poten-\ntial VRA §2 violation, then States would be left without \nthe  “breathing  room”  to  which  this  Court’s  precedent \nand the Constitution entitles them. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at \n1464 (quoting Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 802).  \n\n2.  There  Is  Not  and  Never  Was  Intentional  Vote \n\nDilution In CD27. \n\na.  The  district  court’s  ruling  that  CD27  was  the \nproduct of intentional vote dilution is equally flawed. As \nexplained, see supra p.25, to establish intentional vote di-\nlution, a plaintiff must establish not only discriminatory",
        "49 \n\nintent, but discriminatory vote-dilutive effect. E.g., Shaw \nv. Reno, 509 U.S. at 641. After all, a legislature’s “moti-\nvations” alone cannot “violate equal protection.” Palmer, \n403 U.S. at 224. And to establish the effects prong of an \nintentional-vote-dilution  claim,  a  plaintiff  must  prove \nthat  there  is  “the  possibility  of  creating  more  than  the \nexisting  number  of  reasonably  compact  districts  with  a \nsufficiently large minority population to elect candidates \nof  [the  minority  group’s]  choice.”  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at \n430 (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1008 \n(1994)).  For  VRA  §2 purposes,  “a  sufficiently  large  mi-\nnority  population”  means  a  minority  population  of  at \nleast 50%. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 19.13  \n\nThe district court in 2017 correctly found that CD27 \ndoes “not diminish Hispanic voter opportunity for § 2 ef-\nfects  purposes”  because  “no  additional  compact  Latino \nopportunity district could be drawn” in the region. C.J.S. \nApp.  113a.  And  the  court  correctly  rejected  the  notion \nthat “any voter with a § 2 right must be placed into a § 2 \ndistrict,  or  that  Nueces  County  Hispanics  would  have \nhad a right to be included in a Latino opportunity district \nunder any circumstances.” Id. at 112a n.85; see Shaw v. \nHunt, 517 U.S. 899, 917 n.9 (1996). Those findings suffice \n\n13 A group that cannot meet the 50% threshold cannot establish \na  vote-dilution  effect  because  it  is  not  sufficiently  large  to \n“elect representatives of [its] choice,” 52 U.S.C. §10301(b). So \nany  claim  of  unconstitutional  racial  discrimination  against  a \ngroup too small to form a majority would necessarily be a ra-\ncial-gerrymandering claim, requiring proof that race predom-\ninated  in  placing  the  group  within  a  particular  district,  Be-\nthune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 799.",
        "50 \n\nto establish that Plan C235 did not dilute Hispanic voting \nstrength in this region—in other words, that there was \nno vote dilution.  \n\nThe  district  court  nevertheless  held  that  the  2013 \nLegislature did not “substantially address” the VRA §2 \nchallenges  to  CD27  because  it  “impermissibly  trad[ed] \nthe § 2 rights of Nueces County Hispanic voters for those \nin Travis County, who lacked a § 2 right to a Latino op-\nportunity district.” C.J.S. App. 112a. That conclusion has \nno basis in fact or law. There is no evidence that the 2011 \nLegislature  had Travis  County (or  the  separately  chal-\nlenged  CD35  including  part  of  Travis  County)  in  mind \nwhen it configured CD27, much less that it intentionally \n“traded” voting rights between the districts.  \n\nThe  district  court’s  contrary  conclusion  rests  on  a \nfalse  analogy  to  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  at  429-30, \nwhich held that a State cannot offset the loss of a major-\nity-minority  district  required  by  VRA  §2  by  creating  a \nnoncompact majority-minority district elsewhere in the \nState. C.J.S. App. 180a-181a. But this case does not in-\nvolve “trading” a compact majority-minority district for \na  noncompact  one.  To  the  contrary,  both  the  2011  plan \nand the 2013 plan undisputedly increased the number of \nHispanic-opportunity districts in South and West Texas \nfrom  six  to  seven  by  adding  CD35,  and  maintained  the \nexisting Hispanic-opportunity district based in Cameron \nCounty (formerly CD27, renamed CD34). See Texas, 887 \nF. Supp. 2d at 153 (explaining that CD34 offset changes \nto  CD27  for  purposes  of  VRA  §5  retrogression).  The \nLegislature  did  not  “trade”  Nueces  County  Hispanics’",
        "51 \n\nVRA  §2  voting  rights  at  all—as  the  district  court  cor-\nrectly recognized when it rejected this exact same theory \nin  2012.  See  C.J.S.  App.  421a  &  n.106.  Nothing  has \nchanged since then.  \n\nb.  In all events, the plaintiffs produced no evidence \nthat the Legislature configured CD27 “‘because of,’ not \nmerely  ‘in  spite  of,’  its  adverse  effects  upon”  Hispanic \nvoters  in  Nueces  County.  Feeney,  442  U.S.  at  279.  The \n2011  Legislature  configured  CD27  based  on  specific, \nrace-neutral requests to make Corpus Christi in Nueces \nCounty (2010 Census population: 305,21514) the anchor of \na  congressional  district  separate  from  Brownsville  in \nCameron  County  (2010  Census  population:  175,02315), \ntwo  major  cities  over  160  miles  apart  with  competing \nports and different media markets. See C.J.S. Supp. App. \n288a-291a. Before 2011, CD27 included both cities, as it \nstretched from Nueces County south to include Cameron \nCounty in the Rio Grande Valley.  \n\nIn hearings held before the 2011 legislative session, \nvoters and political leaders in Nueces County expressed \ntheir desire for a Nueces County-anchored district that \nincluded the coastal counties to the north; similarly, vot-\ners and political leaders in the Rio Grande Valley wanted \na  congressional  district  anchored  in  Cameron  County. \nSee,  e.g.,  id.;  2014  Ex.  D-574.  Multiple  legislators  also \n\n14 See U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts, Corpus Christi, Texas,  \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/corpuschristici-\ntytexas/PST045216. \n15  See  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  QuickFacts,  Brownsville,  Texas, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/brownsvilleci-\ntytexas/PST045216.",
        "52 \n\nsupported separating Nueces and Cameron Counties so \nthat the Rio Grande Valley would get an additional con-\ngressional  seat.  See  Aug.  2014  Trial  Tr.  1076-77;  id.  at \n444-45; 2014 Ex. D-607; 2014 Ex. D-574 at 79. Following \nthis  input,  the  2011  Legislature  created  separate  con-\ngressional  districts  anchored  by  Nueces  and  Cameron \nCounties.  CD34—a  Hispanic-opportunity  district  an-\nchored in Cameron County—provided voters in the Rio \nGrande Valley with the opportunity to elect an additional \nmember.  CD27,  anchored  in  Nueces  County,  included \nthe  incumbent  congressman’s  residence  and  coastal \ncounties to the north. C.J.S. Supp. App. 295a-296a.  \n\nThe district court dismissed this substantial and un-\ncontroverted  evidence  as  playing  only  “a  small  role”  in \nthe  creation  of  CD27,  C.J.S.  App.  193a,  and  concluded \nthat the 2011 Legislature’s true motive was to dilute His-\npanic  voting  strength.  The  court  reasoned  that  Nueces \nCounty Hispanic  voters “were intentionally deprived of \ntheir  right  to  elect  candidates  of  their  choice,”  C.J.S. \nApp.  112a,  merely  because  the  2011  Legislature  was \naware  that  CD27  would  likely  be  a  Republican-leaning \ndistrict and that most Hispanic voters in Nueces County \nwere not Republicans. That is wrong as a matter of law. \n“‘Discriminatory  purpose’ . . .  implies  more  than  intent \nas  volition  or  intent  as  awareness  of  consequences.” \nFeeney,  442  U.S.  at  279.  To  treat  mere  awareness  that \nHispanic  voters  will  be  placed  in  a  Republican-leaning \ndistrict as sufficient to establish intentional discrimina-\ntion on the basis of race would lead to the absurd result \nthat  the  Texas  Legislature  can  never  knowingly  place \nHispanic voters in a Republican-leaning district.",
        "53 \n\nIn any case, placing Nueces County Hispanic voters \nin  CD27  makes  little  sense  as  a  vote-dilution  strategy. \nWith or without Nueces County voters, it is not possible \nto create more than seven Hispanic-opportunity districts \nin  the  region.  C.J.S.  App.  113a.  So  a  nefarious  map-\ndrawer  would  have  packed  Hispanic  voters  into  those \nmajority-minority districts—rather than place them in a \nseparate district like CD27. Likewise, the district court’s \nconclusion  that  the  Legislature  “chose  to  put  [Nueces \nCounty Hispanic] voters” in CD27 “to protect an incum-\nbent who was not the candidate of choice of those Latino \nvoters,”  id.  at  191a,  is  illogical.  If  anything,  incumbent \nprotection would be a reason to exclude voters unlikely \nto support the incumbent. See, e.g., LULAC, 548 U.S. at \n441. But the Legislature did just the opposite in CD27. \nThe  only  explanation  that  accounts  for  the  Legisla-\nture’s decision to include all of Nueces County in CD27, \nas  opposed  to  a  small  portion  around  the  incumbent’s \nresidence, is that the Legislature wanted to keep Nueces \nCounty  whole  as  the  anchor  of  a  congressional  district. \nThat purpose is permissible, race-neutral, and fully sup-\nported  by  the  record.  There  is  not  a  shred  of  evidence \nthat the 2011 Legislature placed Nueces County in CD27 \nbecause it intended to disadvantage Hispanic voters—let \nalone sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of \ngood faith.  \n\n3.  The Legislature Did Not Engage in Intentional \n\nVote Dilution in Bell County (HD54). \n\na.  Much  like  with  CD27,  the  plaintiffs’  intentional-\nvote-dilution  challenges  to  the  state-house  districts  in \nBell County fail at the outset because there concededly",
        "54 \n\nis no vote-dilutive effect. It is undisputed that a “major-\nity-minority-CVAP”  district  cannot  be  drawn  in  Bell \nCounty.  H.J.S.  App.  180a.  The  district  court  thus  cor-\nrectly found that there is “no § 2 results violation” in Bell \nCounty. H.J.S. App. 18a. That should have ended the in-\ntentional-vote-dilution-inquiry  too.  See  Shaw  v.  Reno, \n509 U.S. at 641. \n\nb.  Regardless,  there  was  no  basis  for  the  court  to \nfind intentional discrimination either, as the 2011 Legis-\nlature plainly drew the Bell County state-house districts \nwith incumbency and “partisan advantage,” not race, in \nmind.  See  H.J.S.  App.  278a  (Smith,  J.,  dissenting).  Be-\nfore  2011,  HD54  contained  all  of  Burnet  County,  all  of \nLampasas  County,  and  a  small  portion  of  western  Bell \nCounty  that  included  almost  all  of  the  City  of  Killeen, \nwhere  incumbent  Republican  Representative  Aycock \nlived. HD55 included the rest of Bell County, including \nits  eastern  cities  of Temple  and  Belton. Due to  popula-\ntion growth, however, HD54 could no longer include both \nBurnet County and Lampasas County. H.J.S. Supp. App. \n277a-278a.  HD54  would  have  to \njettison  Burnet \nCounty—the  more  populous  of  the  counties—to  keep \nwestern Bell County and Representative Aycock’s home \nin the district. July 2014 Trial Tr. 1727.  \n\nLosing “heavily Republican” Burnet County created \npolitical risk for Representative Aycock, who was there-\nfore “anxious to gain Republican strength and looked for \nplaces that could be done.” H.J.S. Supp. App. 278a. He \nand his colleague from HD55 accordingly reached a com-\npromise whereby HD54 would take from HD55 the Vil-\nlage of Salado in south-central Bell County, a Republican",
        "55 \n\nstronghold,  to  shore  up  HD54  and  Representative  Ay-\ncock’s  incumbency.  Id.  That  undisputed  motivation  be-\nhind  HD54  precludes  any  finding  of  intentional  race-\nbased  discrimination,  as  districting  to  protect  incum-\nbents is a race-neutral explanation, “even if it so happens \nthat the most loyal Democrats happen to be [minorities] \nand even if the State were conscious of that fact.” Hunt \nv. Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 551.  \n\nThe district court clearly erred in concluding other-\nwise. The court complained that a small part of the City \nof Killeen, which happened to include some minority vot-\ners,  was  moved  from  HD54  to  HD55.  H.J.S.  App.  21a-\n22a.  But  dividing  Killeen  was  necessary  to  keep  Lam-\npasas County in HD54, and given Killeen’s very diverse \nand integrated population, dividing the city in any way \nwould  incidentally  affect  some  minority  voters.  Id.  at \n15a.  The  court  also  faulted  Representative  Aycock  for \nobjecting  to  “plans  .  .  .  (such  as  Plan  H202  and  Plan \nH232)  that  would  have  kept  the  City  of  Killeen  more \nwhole in one district.” Id. at 182a. But the substantial and \nunrebutted  evidence  showed  that  Representative  Ay-\ncock declined to support those plans because he wanted \nto preserve his incumbency and maintain his relationship \nwith  constituents  in  Lampasas  County.  July  2014  Trial \nTr. 1744, 1769-70.  \n\nIn any event, the court itself found that “the Legisla-\nture’s intentional failure to create the proposed districts \nwas not intentional vote dilution,” H.J.S. App. 18a, so it \nis  hard  to  see  how  failure  to  support  those  proposals \ncould  amount  to  intentional  discrimination.  In  short, \nthere  is  no  evidence  that  Representative  Aycock,  let",
        "56 \n\nalone  the  Legislature  as  a  whole,  had  the  specific  pur-\npose of harming minority voters when drawing HD54.  \n\nc.  The district court also erred in concluding that the \n2011  Legislature  engaged  in  invidious  vote  dilution  un-\nder the one-person, one-vote doctrine because it failed to \njustify  a  minor  3.32%  population  deviation  between \nHD54 and HD55. Id. at 269a. That conclusion is contrary \nboth to this Court’s one-person, one-vote doctrine and to \nthe record (and, in any event, cannot be attributed to the \n2013 Legislature). \n\nFirst, the district court cited no authority for its ap-\nparent view that a one-person, one-vote violation may be \nfound  based  on  the  deviation  between  two  specific  dis-\ntricts,  as  opposed  to  the  maximum  deviation  among  all \ndistricts in a statewide plan. Relying on Brown v. Thom-\nson, 462 U.S. 835, 842 (1983), the court posited that “the \ngeographic scope of a one person, one vote claim . . . is \nwhatever  the  plaintiff  makes  it.”  H.J.S.  App.  224a.  But \nBrown does not stand for the proposition that plaintiffs \nmay base one-person, one-vote claims on de minimis de-\nviations  in  discrete  geographic  areas.  To  the  contrary, \nBrown simply establishes that a statewide plan may be \nchallenged when one district drastically deviates (there, \nby more than 60%) from the statewide average. 462 U.S. \nat 846. Brown thus provides no support for the district \ncourt’s radical conclusion that States must justify any de-\nviation in any district, no matter how small.  \n\nMore importantly, this Court has never found a one-\nperson, one-vote violation in a state-legislative redistrict-\ning plan based on a deviation as small as the 3.32% devi-",
        "57 \n\nation here. As a general rule, “a maximum population de-\nviation under 10%” constitutes a “minor” deviation insuf-\nficient to “make out a prima facie case of invidious dis-\ncrimination  under  the Fourteenth Amendment  so  as  to \nrequire justification by the State.” Harris v. Ariz. Indep. \nRedistricting  Comm’n,  136  S.  Ct.  1301,  1307  (2016).16 \n“[T]hose  attacking  a  state-approved  plan  must  [there-\nfore] show that it is more probable than not that a devia-\ntion of less than 10% reflects the predominance of illegit-\nimate  reapportionment  factors.”  Id.  Because  it  is  the \nchallenger’s  burden  to  prove  illegitimate  factors  pre-\ndominated—not the State’s burden to prove otherwise—\n“attacks  on  deviations  under  10%  will  succeed  only \nrarely, in unusual cases.” Id.  \n\nRather  than  require  plaintiffs  to  demonstrate  that \nthe de minimis 3.32% deviation they identified between \ntwo districts was the product of illegitimate factors, the \ndistrict  court  faulted  the  Legislature  for  purportedly \n“assum[ing] they could have a 10% deviation without jus-\ntification.”  H.J.S.  App.  240a.  According  to  the  district \ncourt, “deviations may exist, but they must be justified \nby the right reasons.” Id. at 241a. The court then set out \nto  “analyze  whether  the  population  deviations  in  Plan \nH283  are  explained  by  legitimate  legislative  policies  in \nways that justify the challenged deviations,” id. at 199a, \nand faulted the State because statewide “population de-\nviations  were  intentionally  not  minimized  beyond  10%, \n\n16 In contrast, congressional plans are held to a stricter stand-\nard of near-perfect population equalization under the one-per-\nson, one-vote doctrine. E.g., Evenwel v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. 1120, \n1124 (2016).",
        "58 \n\nand were not explained or justified on the legislative rec-\nord during the session.” Id. at 238a.  \n\nThat  reasoning is  flatly  contrary  to  this  Court’s  ad-\nmonition that plaintiffs bear the burden of proving “that \nit is more probable than not that a deviation of less than \n10%  reflects  the  predominance  of  illegitimate  reappor-\ntionment factors,” and that “attacks on deviations under \n10% will succeed only rarely, in unusual cases,” Harris, \n136 S. Ct. at 1307. As Brown and Harris make clear, it \nwas the plaintiffs’ burden to prove that the de minimis \n3.32% deviation between two districts was the product of \nillegitimate  reasons,  not  the  Legislature’s  burden  to \nprove that it was the product of legitimate ones. And as \nalready  explained,  see  supra  pp.54-55,  the  plaintiffs \nplainly failed to meet that burden. \n\n4.  The  Legislature  Did  Not  Intentionally  Dilute \nHispanic  Voting  Strength  in  Dallas  County \n(HD103, HD104, and HD105). \n\na.  As  with  their  other \n\nintentional-vote-dilution \nclaims, the district court should have rejected the plain-\ntiffs’ intentional-vote-dilution claims in three west Dallas \nCounty districts—HD103, HD104, and HD105—for the \nstraightforward  reason  that  there  was  no  vote-dilutive \neffect.  Although  the  parties  disputed  many  factual  is-\nsues, one thing was certain: it was not possible to draw \nadditional  majority-minority  districts \nin  Dallas \nCounty—even with the data available at the time of trial \nin July 2017, more than four years after the Legislature",
        "59 \n\nadopted Plan H358.17 MALC’s own expert expressly con-\nceded this point. 2017 Trial Tr. 48. Moreover, the plain-\ntiffs  failed  to  prove  even  that  additional  coalition  dis-\ntricts—which  are  not  required  by  VRA  §2—could  be \ndrawn in Dallas County. H.J.S. App. 26a (finding lack of \npolitical  cohesion).  Without  “the  possibility  of  creating \nmore  than  the  existing  number  of  reasonably  compact \ndistricts with a sufficiently large minority population to \nelect  candidates  of  [the  minority  group’s]  choice,”  LU-\nLAC,  548  U.S.  at  430  (quoting  De  Grandy,  512  U.S.  at \n1008), there can be no vote dilution. See Shaw v. Reno, \n509 U.S. at 641. \n\nb.   Regardless  of  the  absence  of  a  vote-dilution  ef-\nfect, there is absolutely no evidence that the 2011 Legis-\nlature intentionally discriminated when it drew HD105. \nAs  a  result  of  the  2010  Census,  the  2011  Legislature \nfaced the difficult task of removing two Republican dis-\ntricts  (one  of  which  was  HD106)  from  Dallas  County \nwithout  eliminating  any  existing  minority-opportunity \ndistricts.  H.J.S.  Supp.  App.  222a.  To  give  HD106’s  in-\ncumbent,  Representative  Anderson,  a  chance  to  retain \nhis  seat,  the  Legislature  decided  to  extend  nearby  Re-\npublican HD105 significantly southward into what other-\nwise would be HD104 to include Anderson’s home. Id. at \n229a-230a.  This  allowed  Anderson  to  run  against \n\n17  HD104  is  a  majority-Hispanic  district.  H.J.S.  App.  167a. \nHD103  was  not  a  majority-Hispanic  district,  but  it  was  elect-\ning  the  Hispanic-preferred  candidate,  Representative  Rafael \nAnchia. Id. at 170a.",
        "60 \n\nHD105’s  Republican  incumbent,  Representative  Har-\nper-Brown,  in  a  relatively safe  Republican  district. Id.; \nJ.A. 454a.  \n\nThe  district  court  tried  to  portray  this incumbency-\nprotection  decision  in  a  negative  light,  claiming  that \n“mapdrawers improperly used race to make HD103 and \nHD104 more Hispanic and HD105 more Anglo.” H.J.S. \nApp. 23a.18 But that makes no sense as a theory of vote \ndilution.  As  the  legislative  staff  member  who  drew \nHD105 explained, he ensured that areas with significant \nHispanic  voting  population  were  kept  in  HD104,  thus \nmaintaining  HD104  as  a  minority-opportunity  district \nwith  a  Spanish-surname-voter-registration  above  50%. \nHe conducted a similar exercise to keep the Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration of HD103 around its benchmark \nlevel of 39%. H.J.S. Supp. App. 227a-229a. Moving His-\npanic  voters  from  HD105  to  HD103  and  HD104  placed \nthem  in  districts  where,  unlike  in  HD105,  they  were \nlikely  to  be  represented  by  Hispanic  candidates  of \nchoice. Id. at 222a, 230a. That is the opposite of minority \nvote dilution. \n\n5.  The  Legislature  Did  Not  Intentionally  Dilute \nHispanic  Voting  Strength  in  Nueces  County \n(HD32 and HD34). \n\na.  There  is  not  and  never  was  any  intentional  vote \ndilution in the state-house districts in Nueces County. As \n\n18  Although  the  district  court  seemed  to  focus  on  the  use  of \nracial  data,  it  did  not  find  racial  gerrymandering,  nor  could \nit—the plaintiffs did not even plead claims of racial gerryman-\ndering in Dallas County. H.J.S. App. 192a-193a.",
        "61 \n\nan  initial  matter,  there  could  not  have  been  intentional \nvote  dilution  in  Nueces  County  because,  once  again, \nthere was no vote-dilution effect. See infra Part IV.A.  \n\nb.  Regardless, the record is devoid of any evidence \nof  intent  to  dilute  minority  voting  strength.  Under  the \nplan that existed in 2010, Nueces County contained two \nTexas  House Districts  (HD33  and  HD34)  and part  of  a \nthird (HD32), all of which were represented by Republi-\ncans. H.J.S. Supp. App. 89a-91a. Based on the 2010 Cen-\nsus, a relative decline in population entitled the county to \nonly  two  Texas  House  districts.  See  H.J.S.  App.  27a. \nConsequently,  as  required  by  the  Texas  Constitution’s \nwhole-county  provision,  Tex.  Const.  art.  III,  §26,  the \n2011 Legislature apportioned two Texas House districts \nto  Nueces  County  (HD32  and  HD34).  See  H.J.S.  App. \n27a.  One  of  those  (HD34)  was  drawn  as  a  Hispanic-op-\nportunity district. Id. at 57a. That ensured roughly pro-\nportional representation, as Hispanic voters “are around \n56%  of  the  relevant  population  (CVAP)”  in  Nueces \nCounty.  Id.  at  51a.  The  other  district  (HD32)  replaced \nthe two previous Republican districts with one protect-\ning  the  most  senior  incumbent  of  the  delegation.  See \nH.J.S. Supp. App. 100a (noting seniority).  \n\nThe district court nonetheless found both intentional \nvote dilution and a vote-dilution effect in Nueces County \nbecause the Legislature did not draw “an additional com-\npact  minority  district,”  H.J.S.  App.  54a—that  is,  “two \nHCVAP-majority  districts  wholly  within  Nueces \nCounty,” id. at 59a. This was clear legal and factual er-\nror, as there was no possible way to draw two performing",
        "62 \n\nmajority-minority districts in Nueces County. See infra \nPart IV.A. To state the obvious, the Legislature did not \nengage  in  intentional  discrimination  by  declining  to  do \nthe impossible—particularly given that, had the Legisla-\nture  actually  split  the  county’s  Hispanic  population  in \nhalf, it undoubtedly would have been charged with vote \ndilution.  \n\nThe district court did not and could not explain how \nthis  decision  amounted  to  intentional  vote  dilution.  In-\nstead,  it  rested  its  intentional-discrimination  finding \nlargely  on  a  meritless  one-person,  one-vote  argument \nthat was expressly disclaimed by MALC, the only plain-\ntiff  asserting  claims  against  the  Nueces  County  state-\nhouse  districts.  See  2017  Trial  Tr.  22;  H.J.S.  App.  30a, \n31a n.21. Just like in Bell County, the court found a one-\nperson, one-vote violation in Nueces County based on a \nminor  deviation  between  two  specific  districts—a  mere \n3.63%  deviation  between  HD32  (0.34%  below  the \nstatewide  ideal)  and  HD34  (3.29%  above  the  statewide \nideal). Id. at 254a. As explained above, that alone was le-\ngal  error  because  (1)  it  was  not  a  statewide  maximum-\ndeviation analysis; (2) it is the plaintiffs’ burden to prove \nthat  such  minor  deviations  are  illegitimate, see  Harris, \n136 S. Ct. at 1307; and (3) “attacks on deviations under \n10%  will succeed  only rarely,  in  unusual  cases,” id.  See \nsupra pp.55-58.  \n\nBut  even  setting  those  problems  aside,  the  district \ncourt clearly erred when it assumed that the 2011 Legis-\nlature must have invidiously relied on racial data merely",
        "63 \n\nbecause “HD34 is significantly more Hispanic in popula-\ntion  and  significantly more  overpopulated  than  HD32.” \nH.J.S.  App.  255a.  First,  a  deviation  of  less  than  4%  is \nhardly  “significantly  more  overpopulated.”  Second,  a \ncourt may not assume invidious intent from the mere ex-\nistence of disparate result. See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. \nInstead,  it  was  the  plaintiffs’  burden  to  rebut  the  pre-\nsumption of good faith, and prove up their counter-intui-\ntive  claim  that  removing  two  of  the  three  Republican \nrepresentatives from Nueces County and adding a per-\nforming  Hispanic-opportunity \nsomehow \namounted to intentional vote dilution. That, the plaintiffs \nutterly failed to do.  \n\ndistrict \n\n*   *   * \n\nIn sum, the court-ordered districts later invalidated \nby  the  district  court  were preserved  in  the  court’s  own \n2012 remedial maps for an obvious reason: those districts \nwere  not  infected  with  any  discriminatory  “taint”  to \nbegin with. The court itself found as much back in 2012, \nas it was bound to do given this Court’s mandate to “draw \ninterim maps that do not violate the Constitution or the \nVoting Rights Act.” Perry, 565 U.S. at 396. Accordingly, \neven if the intentions of the 2011 Legislature were rele-\nvant,  they  supply  no  basis  whatsoever  for  invalidating \nany  of  the  districts  that  the  2013  Legislature  adopted \nverbatim from the district court’s interim maps.  \nIV. The Two Remaining Challenges To The 2013 Plans \n\nAre Meritless. \n\nThe conclusion that the Legislature did not engage in \nintentional  discrimination  when  it  adopted  the  district",
        "64 \n\ncourt’s interim maps as its own suffices to invalidate the \nbulk of the district court’s holdings, as all but one of the \ndistricts  the  court  invalidated  were  adopted  verbatim \nfrom the court-imposed maps, and each of those districts \nwas  invalidated  on  intentional-discrimination  grounds. \nBut  the  district  court  invalidated  two  state-house  dis-\ntricts on grounds that are not controlled by that analysis, \nfinding a VRA §2 results violation based on a vote-dilu-\ntion effect in one district (HD32 in Nueces County), and \nfinding  racial  gerrymandering  in  the  lone  invalidated \ndistrict  that  was  not  adopted  verbatim  from  the  court-\nordered plan (HD90 in Tarrant County). While defend-\nants  certainly  concede  (contrary  to  the  district  court’s \nclaims) that the 2013 plans were not “insulated” from at-\ntack on those grounds, each of those holdings is legally \nand factually unsustainable.  \n\nA.  There  Is  No  Vote-Dilutive  Effect  in  Nueces \n\nCounty State-House Districts. \n\nThe district court’s 2017 orders sustained only one ef-\nfects claim in the entirety of the 2013 maps, finding vote-\ndilutive  effect  in  HD32  in  Nueces  County.  The  district \ncourt  correctly  rejected  that  very  same  claim  in  2012, \nH.J.S.  App.  303a,  and  the  majority  should  have  joined \nJudge Smith in doing so again in 2017, id. at 298a. \n\nAs discussed, see supra pp.48-49, to establish a vote-\ndilution effect under VRA §2, a plaintiff must establish \n“the possibility of creating more than the existing num-\nber  of  reasonably  compact  districts  with  a  sufficiently \nlarge minority population to elect candidates of [the mi-\nnority group’s] choice.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 430 (quoting",
        "65 \n\nDe Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1008). To qualify as “sufficiently \nlarge” for the VRA to require the district, the minority \npopulation must be at least 50%, Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 19, \nbut it must also be large enough to actually perform and \nprovide  minority  voters  with  the  opportunity  to  elect \ntheir preferred candidates. See, e.g., LULAC, 548 U.S. at \n428 (noting that “it may be possible for a citizen voting-\nage majority to lack real electoral opportunity”).  \n\nThe  district  court  itself  recognized  that  it  was  not \npossible  to  draw  two  state-house  districts  in  56%  His-\npanic  Nueces  County  with  enough  Hispanic  voters  to \nconsistently  elect  Hispanic  candidates  of  choice.  Plain-\ntiffs’  attempt  to  draw  two  Hispanic-citizen-voting-age-\nmajority districts in Nueces County left Hispanic voters \n“essentially worse off than under Plan H358 because one \ndistrict  would  not  perform  at  all  and  one  performed \npoorly (compared to Plan H358, where one district does \nperform consistently for Latinos).” H.J.S. App. 49a-50a; \nid.  at  55a  (explaining  that  plaintiff  MALC’s  effort  pro-\nduced  “two  HCVAP-majority  districts  that  are  poorly \nperforming or not yet performing”).  \n\nMALC’s own expert testified that he could not “draw \ntwo  districts  wholly  contained  within  Nueces  County \nthat  were  Latino  CVAP  majorities  and  .  .  .  both  per-\nformed for the Latino community.” J.A. 387a. As he ex-\nplained, when he attempted to draw two districts wholly \nwithin  Nueces  County  with  at  least  50%  Hispanic-citi-\nzen-voting-age  population,  one  district  elected  the  mi-\nnority-preferred candidate in only 7 of 35 elections ana-\nlyzed, and the other in none. J.A. 386a-387a; see also, e.g.,",
        "66 \n\nH.J.S. Supp. App. 93a (noting Texas Legislative Council \nattorney  David  Hanna’s  conclusion  in  2011  that  it  was \n“highly  unlikely  that  you  can  ever  get  two  performing \ndistricts for Hispanics no matter how you draw them”); \nid. at 94a-95a (suggesting drawing one “clearly perform-\ning”  Hispanic-opportunity  district in Nueces  County  to \navoid retrogression).  \n\nThat  evidence  confirms  that  creating  two  districts \nwithin  Nueces  County  with  at  least  50%  Hispanic-citi-\nzen-voting-age-population would not have created an op-\nportunity  to  elect  the  minority-preferred  candidate  in \ntwo districts. To the contrary, it would result in levels of \nperformance  for  Hispanic-preferred  candidates  “so  low \nas to indicate a lack of real electoral opportunity in both \ndistricts.”  H.J.S.  App.  44a.  Accordingly,  not  only  did \nVRA §2 not require two such districts; if the State had \ntried  to  draw  them,  it  undoubtedly  would  have  been \ncharged  with  vote  dilution.  See  id.  at  96a  (“[A]  50% \nHCVAP district is theoretically an opportunity district, \nbut it may still be challenged by Plaintiffs as not provid-\ning  real  electoral  opportunity.”).  And  the  district  court \nexpressly rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that VRA §2 re-\nquired the Legislature to violate the whole-county provi-\nsion  to  create  an  additional  Hispanic-opportunity  dis-\ntrict.  Id.  at  49a-50a,  59a  (“[B]reaking  the  County  Line \nRule twice to remove Anglos and incorporate even more \nHispanics  to  improve  electoral  outcomes  goes  beyond \nwhat  §  2  requires.”).  That  should  have  been  the  end  of \nthe inquiry.",
        "67 \n\nInstead, the district court concluded that the Legis-\nlature violated §2 by failing to draw two Hispanic-major-\nity  districts  within  Nueces  County—despite  the  undis-\nputed evidence submitted by MALC itself that such dis-\ntricts would not perform for Hispanic voters—on the the-\nory that MALC failed to prove “that the districts in [its \ndemonstration plan] do not provide real electoral oppor-\ntunity.” H.J.S. App. 55a (emphasis added). That conclu-\nsion is inexplicable. It was MALC’s burden to prove that \ntwo such districts would perform, but MALC conceded \nthat they would not. The Legislature cannot plausibly be \nfound to have caused vote dilution by failing to draw dis-\ntricts  that  MALC agreed  would  have  provided  less  op-\nportunity  to  elect  Hispanic-preferred  candidates  than \nthe districts in Plan H358.  \n\nThe  district  court’s  error  is  confirmed  by  evidence \nshowing that state-house districts in Nueces County do \nnot dilute Hispanic voting strength. Because the existing \ndistricts  provide  proportional  representation,  the  dis-\ntrict court itself recognized that “[c]reating a second [op-\nportunity]  district  would  result  in  over-representation \n[of Hispanic voters] in Nueces County.” Id. at 51a. And \nit  expressly  found  that  “Hispanics  are  being  elected  to \ncountywide offices and as house district representatives, \nindicating a lack of barriers to candidacy and election.” \nId. at 55a, see also, e.g., H.J.S. Supp. App. 111a (“There \nhave been a significant number of Latinos in elected of-\nfice  in  Nueces  County.  Three  of  eight  Corpus  Christi \ncouncil members are Hispanic, as are the county attor-",
        "68 \n\nney, Nueces County district clerk, and three of eight dis-\ntrict  court  judges.”  (citations  omitted)).  The  district \ncourt’s own findings thus confirm that the configuration \nof  Nueces  County  House  districts  does  not  dilute  His-\npanic voting strength.  \n\nB.  The Legislature Did Not Engage in Unconstitu-\ntional  Racial  Gerrymandering  in  Reconfigur-\ning Tarrant County’s HD90. \n\nRemarkably,  the  district  court  not  only  accused the \nLegislature of engaging in intentional discrimination by \nfailing  to  change  the  districts  that  the  court  itself  im-\nposed, but also managed to conclude that the Legislature \nengaged in racial gerrymandering in one of the very few \ndistricts that it did change. That conclusion perfectly il-\nlustrates  the dilemma that  state  legislatures face  when \nthey  attempt  to  balance  the  competing  demands  of  the \nVRA and the Equal Protection Clause. The district court \nin 2012 adopted the previous version of HD90 as a ma-\njority-Hispanic  district;  the  2013  Legislature  drew  the \nreconfigured  2013  version  as  a  majority-Hispanic  dis-\ntrict;  and  plaintiffs  in  this  lawsuit  told  the  Legislature \n(both in 2011 and 2013) that HD90 had to be retained as \na  majority-Hispanic  district.  Yet  the  district court  held \nthat the Legislature did not even have “good reasons” for \nretaining HD90 as a majority-Hispanic district. \n\nThat  conclusion  is  impossible  to  reconcile  with  this \nCourt’s  precedent.  Contrary  to  the  district court’s  con-\ntentions,  “avoid[ing]  a  potential  VRA  problem”  is  not \njust “a vague goal” that fails to provide the “strong basis \nin evidence” to believe “that the VRA require[s] [the] use",
        "69 \n\nof race.” H.J.S. App. 81a. Instead, this Court has repeat-\nedly  recognized  that  “complying  with  operative  provi-\nsions of the Voting Rights Act” is a sufficiently “compel-\nling interest” to justify a decision to redistrict on the ba-\nsis  of  race.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1464  (citing  Shaw  v. \nHunt,  517  U.S.  at  915);  see  Bethune-Hill,  137  S. Ct.  at \n801; Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1272-74. And the State had \nthe  strongest  of  “‘good  reasons’  to  think  that  it  would \ntransgress the [VRA] if it did not draw race-based dis-\ntrict lines” by maintaining HD90 as a majority-Hispanic \ndistrict,  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1464  (quoting  Bethune-\nHill, 137 S. Ct. at 802), as the plaintiffs consistently ar-\ngued that this was the case. \n\nIn 2011, MALDEF urged the Legislature to increase \nthe Hispanic-citizen-voting-age-population and Spanish-\nsurname-voter-registration in HD90 because it was pos-\nsible to create “a clear Latino CVAP majority district” in \nTarrant County. H.J.S. Supp. App. 258a-259a. The 2011 \nLegislature  accommodated  the  request,  raising  the \nSpanish-surname-voter-registration  of  HD90  to  just \nover 50%—in part by moving the predominantly African-\nAmerican  neighborhood  of  Como  into  an  adjoining  Re-\npublican  district.  H.J.S.  App.  68a,  174a.  And  the  2011 \nLegislature was very clear as to why it did so: MALDEF \n[Spanish-surname-voter-registration] \n“testified \nneeded  to  be  above  50%.”  H.J.S.  Supp.  App.  264a.  Be-\ncause Como had been part of the district since 1978, how-\never,  the  2013  Legislature  wanted  to  honor  Como’s  re-\nquest to be moved back into HD90—a request also made \nby  the  Democratic  incumbent  (and  MALC  member), \n\nthat",
        "70 \n\nRepresentative  Burnam.  H.J.S.  App.  71a-72a,  75a,  77a. \nSo in 2013, the Legislature sought to reconfigure HD90 \nfrom the 2012 court-imposed version to accomplish two \ngoals:  (1)  moving  the  predominantly  African-American \nneighborhood of Como back into HD90 as it requested, \nand (2) keeping HD90 as a majority-Hispanic district to \ncomply with VRA §2. \n\nMoving  Como  back  into  HD90  created  a  potential \nproblem,  however,  because  it  would  decrease  the  dis-\ntrict’s Spanish-surname-voter-registration from approx-\nimately 51% to 48.2%. J.A. 399a. And when Representa-\ntive  Burnam’s  chief  of  staff  presented  a  proposed  map \nthat  would  do  just  that,  MALC’s  counsel  expressly  in-\nformed  him  that  MALC  could  not  “support  a  map  that \nbrought the SSVR below 50 percent” because that would \n“substantially dilute[] Hispanic voting power.” J.A. 398a, \n403a. That concern was well-founded, as an elected offi-\ncial from the area stated that even with 50% Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration, it was far from clear that His-\npanic  voters  would be able  to  nominate  their  preferred \ncandidate in the Democratic primary. 2017 Trial Tr. 317. \nIn  2012,  incumbent  Representative  Burnam—who  was \nnot  the  Hispanic  candidate  of  choice,  H.J.S.  App.  69a \nn.45—staved  off  a  primary  challenge  from  Carlos \nVasquez  by  159  votes,  even  though  Spanish-surname-\nvoter-registration  was  above  50%,  id.  at  72a.  And,  in \n2014, challenger Ramon Romero, Jr., defeated Burnam \nin the primary by only 110 votes. Id. at 76a. So lowering \nSpanish-surname-voter-registration by only a few points",
        "71 \n\ncould  make  all  the  difference  for  Hispanic  voters  in \nHD90. \n\nHaving  heard  MALC’s  legal  concerns,  Burnam  in-\nstructed  his  chief  of  staff  to  draw  a  map  that  returned \nComo to HD90 but also kept the district’s Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration above 50%. H.J.S. App. 72a-73a; \nJ.A. 401a. Burnam incorporated that proposed map into \nan amendment, which was adopted by the House without \nobjection and incorporated into the plan that was even-\ntually enacted as Plan H358. J.A. 407a. \n\nProving  that  no  good  deed  goes  unpunished,  the \nState then found itself confronted with not one, but two \nlegal  challenges—one  by  MALC  and  the  Task  Force \nclaiming that the Legislature engaged in intentional vote \ndilution by failing to add enough Hispanic voters to now-\nmajority-Hispanic HD90, and another facially contradic-\ntory challenge by the Task Force claiming that the Leg-\nislature engaged in racial gerrymandering by using race \nat all when drawing HD90. H.J.S. App. 70a-71a.  \n\nThe district court correctly rejected the intentional-\nvote-dilution  claim,  concluding  that  HD90  sufficiently \nmaintained Hispanic voting strength as a majority-His-\npanic  district.  H.J.S.  App.  84a.  But  the  court  then  sus-\ntained  the  racial  gerrymandering  claim—even  though \nthe court itself had adopted the 2012 version of HD90 as \na  majority-Hispanic  district—claiming  that  there  was \n“no evidence” of “the amendment’s effect on Latino vot-\ning ability in HD90.” H.J.S. App. 82a. That holding is in-\nexplicable. Not only had MALDEF told the Legislature \nthat HD90 needed to be a majority-Hispanic district, but",
        "72 \n\nMALC expressly opposed any drop below 50% Spanish-\nsurname-voter-registration  because  that  would  “sub-\nstantially  dilute[]  Hispanic  voting  power.”  J.A.  403a-\n404a.  That  assertion  was  supported  by  the  extremely \ntight  2012  and  2014  primary  elections  in  HD90,  one  of \nwhich the Hispanic candidate of choice narrowly lost.  \n\nThe notion that a legislature may not consider race to \naddress  a  specific,  race-based  concern  about  potential \nvote  dilution  defies  common  sense.  This  Court  has  ad-\nmonished  more  times  than  bears  repeating  that  States \ncannot be caught “between the competing hazards of lia-\nbility” under the Constitution and the VRA. E.g., Bush, \n517 U.S. at 977. Allowing plaintiffs to charge a legislature \nwith  an  unlawful  purpose  for  attempting  to  address  a \nrace-based complaint is a surefire way to eliminate what \nlittle “breathing room” legislatures have left to enact dis-\ntricting  legislation  that  withstands  judicial  scrutiny. \nCooper, 137 S.

Whether  the  district  court  issued  an  appealable \ninterlocutory  injunction  when  it  invalidated  Texas  con-\ngressional and state-house redistricting plans and effec-\ntively prevented Texas from using those plans in future \nelections, by imposing expedited deadlines for the State \nto  either  engage  in  another  round  of  legislative  redis-\ntricting or face court-imposed redistricting just days be-\nfore districts had to be set for the 2018 elections. \n\n2.   Whether the Texas Legislature acted with an un-\nlawful purpose when it enacted districts imposed by the \ndistrict  court  itself—which  the  district  court  had  im-\nposed pursuant to this Court’s 2012 mandate to fix any \nplausible  constitutional  and  statutory  defects  in  prior \nlegislative plans that were repealed without ever having \ntaken effect—and when there was no unlawful taint be-\nhind these court-imposed districts to begin with, as the \ndistrict court explained in its lengthy 2012 opinions. \n\n3.  Whether  state-house  districts  in  Nueces  County \nproduced  a  vote-dilution  effect  when  the  district  court \nexpressly recognized that an additional performing ma-\njority-minority opportunity district could not be created \nthere  without  breaking  the  State’s  rule  to  maintain \ncounty lines if possible—which the court held was not re-\nquired by the Voting Rights Act. \n\n4.

But if \nthe nearly inevitable litigation comes to pass, one would \nhave thought there was one reasonably safe course avail-\nable  to bring  it  to  an end—namely, enacting the three-\njudge  court’s  remedial  redistricting  plan  as the  legisla-\nture’s own. Think again.  \n\nAs it turns out, even that will not suffice, as the deci-\nsions below reached the remarkable conclusion that the \nTexas Legislature engaged in intentional racial discrim-\nination by enacting into law maps imposed by the same \ndistrict court one cycle earlier to remedy alleged infirmi-\nties with the Legislature’s initial maps. According to the \ndistrict court, its own maps were infected with the “taint \nof  discriminatory  intent”—a  taint  that  the  Legislature \n(but apparently not the court) was obligated to “remove” \nif it wanted to adopt those maps as state law rather than \njust abide by them as a judicial decree. \n\nThat  conclusion  is  every  bit  as  implausible  as  it \nsounds  and  entirely  turns  on  its  head  this  Court’s  re-\npeated emphasis on the primacy of States and state leg-\nislatures when it comes to redistricting. The maps at is-\nsue  here  were  imposed  after  this  Court  instructed  the \ndistrict  court  “to  draw  interim  maps”  for  Texas’s  2012 \nelections “that do not violate the Constitution or the Vot-\ning Rights Act.” Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 396 (2012) \n(per curiam). And by its own telling in lengthy 2012 opin-\nions, the district court assiduously abided by that man-\ndate. There is absolutely no support for the novel propo-\n\n(1) \n\n \n \n\f2 \n\nsition that the same map can be constitutional when im-\nposed by the court, but unconstitutional—let alone inten-\ntionally discriminatory—when embraced by the legisla-\nture.  If  anything,  the strong  presumption  of  good  faith \nthat applies to state redistricting legislation ought to be \nvirtually  unassailable  when  a  legislature  enacts  redis-\ntricting plans only after a federal court has issued opin-\nions explaining in exhaustive detail how those plans ad-\ndressed every “plausible” constitutional or statutory ob-\njection, H.J.S. App. 313a, and were “not purposefully dis-\ncriminatory,” C.J.S. App. 408a.  \n\nThe district court concluded otherwise only by jetti-\nsoning nearly every pillar of this Court’s redistricting ju-\nrisprudence—from  the  strong  presumption  of  constitu-\ntionality  and  good  faith,  to  the  primacy  of  States  and \nstate  legislatures  in  redistricting,  to  the  extraordinary \ncaution  courts  must  exercise  when  confronting  inten-\ntional-discrimination claims, to the principle that inten-\ntional vote dilution exists only when the legislature actu-\nally  sets  out  to  reduce  minority  voting  strength,  to  the \nrule  that  VRA  compliance  is  a  defense  to  racial-gerry-\nmandering claims. Under a correct application of those \nsettled legal principles, the plaintiffs have not come close \nto satisfying their burden of proving that the Legislature \nenacted the district court’s own maps in a sinister effort \nto discriminate against minority voters. Instead, all the \nevidence  confirms  that  the  obvious  answer  is  the  right \none: the Legislature embraced the court’s maps for the \nperfectly permissible reason that it wanted to bring the \nlitigation  to  an  end  and  took  the  court  at  its  word  that \nthose maps complied with the Constitution and the VRA. \n\n \n \n\f3 \n\nThe district court’s decision to invalidate its own reme-\ndial maps as intentionally discriminatory cannot stand.  \n\nO PIN IO N S   B E LO W \n\nThe  three-judge  district  court’s  order  on  Plan  C235 \nis available at 274 F.

In 2011, following the decennial census, the Texas \nLegislature enacted redistricting plans for Texas state-\nlegislative and congressional districts.2 Before the Leg-\nislature even enacted those plans, however, the plaintiffs \nfiled  this  lawsuit  challenging  the  State’s  congressional \nredistricting plan (Plan C185) and its redistricting plan \nfor  the  Texas  State  House  of  Representatives  (Plan \nH283)  under  the  Constitution  and  VRA  §2.  The  Chief \nJudge of the Fifth Circuit constituted a three-judge dis-\ntrict court under 28 U.S.C. §2284. J.A. 2a.  \n\nBecause  Texas  was subject to  VRA  §5  at  that  time, \nits legislatively enacted plans could not take legal effect \nuntil they were precleared. See 52 U.S.C. §10304. Texas \nsought preclearance by filing a suit for declaratory judg-\nment in the United States District Court for the District \nof Columbia.  \n\nB.  While  the  D.C.  preclearance  lawsuit  was  still \npending, the Texas three-judge district court proceeded \nto  conduct  a  two-week  trial  on  the  constitutional  and \nVRA  §2  challenges  to the  not-yet-operative 2011  plans. \nJ.A.  13a-17a.  Because a  final  judgment in  the preclear-\nance  litigation  seemed  unlikely  to  come  in  time  for  the \n2012 election cycle, the district court ordered the parties \nto submit proposed interim plans for the 2012 elections. \nJ.A. 17a-18a. \n\n2 Act of May 21, 2011, 82nd Leg., R.S., ch. 1271, 2011 Tex. Gen. \nLaws  3435-3552  (creating  Plan  H283);  Act  of  June  20,  2011, \n82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 1, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 5091-5180 (cre-\nating Plan C185). \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f5 \n\nIn November 2011, a 2-1 majority of the district court \nentered  separate  orders  directing  the  State  to  conduct \nthe 2012 elections under plans drawn by the court. Con-\ncluding that it “was not required to give any deference to \nthe Legislature’s enacted plan,” the majority announced \nthat it had drawn “independent map[s]” based on “neu-\ntral principles that advance the interest of the collective \npublic  good.”  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  396.  Judge  Smith  dis-\nsented  from  both  orders,  explaining  that  the  majority \nhad imposed  “a  runaway plan  that imposes  an extreme \nredistricting  scheme”  that  was  completely  “untethered \nto the applicable caselaw.” H.J.S. App. 279a.  \n\nThe  State  appealed,  and  on  January  20,  2012,  this \nCourt  unanimously  vacated  the  district  court’s  orders, \nholding that “the District Court exceeded its mission to \ndraw  interim  maps  that  do  not  violate  the  Constitution \nor the Voting Rights Act, and substituted its own concept \nof ‘the collective public good’ for the Texas Legislature’s \ndetermination of which policies serve ‘the interests of the \ncitizens  of  Texas.’”  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  396.  Reiterating \nthat “[r]edistricting is primarily the duty and responsi-\nbility  of  the  State,”  id.  at  392  (quoting  Chapman  v. \nMeier, 420 U.S. 1, 27 (1975)), this Court explained that a \ndistrict court forced to impose its own redistricting map \nshould not simply “ignore any state plan that has not re-\nceived § 5 preclearance.” Id. at 395. \n\nAt  the  same  time,  however,  this  Court  made  clear \nthat a district court imposing an interim plan “must, of \ncourse, take care not to incorporate into the interim plan \nany  legal  defects.”  Id.  at  394.  Indeed,  the  Court  ex-\ninstructed  the  district  court—six  separate \npressly \n\n \n \n\f6 \n\ntimes—that  it  must  impose  plans  that  comply  with  the \nConstitution and the VRA: \n\n•  The district court’s “mission [is] to draw interim \nmaps  that  do  not  violate  the  Constitution  or  the \nVoting Rights Act.” Id. at 396. \n\n•  “A district court making . . . use of a State’s plan \nmust, of course, take care not to incorporate into \nthe  interim  plan  any  legal  defects  in  the  state \nplan.” Id. at 394. \n\n•  “[A]  district  court  should  still  be  guided  by  [the \nState’s] plan, except to the extent those legal chal-\nlenges  are  shown  to  have  a  likelihood  of  success \non the merits.” Id. \n\n•  “[T]he  district  court  [must]  confine[]  itself  to \ndrawing interim maps that comply with the Con-\nstitution and the Voting Rights Act, without dis-\nplacing legitimate state policy judgments with the \ncourt’s own preferences.” Id. \n\n•  “‘[A] court, as a general rule, should be guided by \nthe legislative policies underlying’ a state plan—\neven one that was itself unenforceable—‘to the ex-\ntent those policies do not lead to violations of the \nConstitution or the Voting Rights Act.’” Id. at 393 \n(quoting  Abrams  v.  Johnson,  521  U.S.  74,  79 \n(1997)). \n\n•  The district court should “take guidance from the \nlawful  policies  incorporated  in  [a  not-yet-pre-\ncleared] plan.” Id. at 395. \n\n \n \n\f7 \n\nMoreover, this Court made clear that when assessing \nwhether  the  State’s  plans  suffered  from  any  “legal  de-\nfects,”  the  district  court  need  not  confine  itself  to  ad-\ndressing  proven  constitutional  or  VRA  violations.  In-\nstead, given the preliminary posture of the litigation, the \nCourt instructed the district court to remedy any district \nas to which the plaintiffs had demonstrated that a consti-\ntutional  or  VRA  §2  claim  was  “likely  to  succeed  on  the \nmerits,”  id.  at  394,  as  well  as  any  “aspects  of  the  state \nplan that stand a reasonable probability of failing to gain \n§ 5 preclearance,” which the Court also described as any \naspect of the plan subject to a “not insubstantial” §5 chal-\nlenge.  Id.  at  395.  In  other  words,  the  Court  instructed \nthe district court to adopt maps that remedied not only \nany  actual  constitutional  or  VRA  violations,  but  also \n“likely” violations and “not insubstantial” §5 claims.   \n\nC.  On remand, the parties submitted proposed find-\nings  of  fact  and  extensive  briefing,  including  post-trial \nbriefs from the preclearance litigation. C.J.S. App. 380a; \nJ.A.  26a-50a.  After  holding  two  more  days  of  hearings, \nJ.A. 43a, the district court adopted interim congressional \nand  state-house  plans  for  the  2012  elections.  The  court \nexplained that its interim plans “obey[ed] the Supreme \nCourt’s directive by adhering to the State’s enacted plan \nexcept in the discrete areas in which we have preliminar-\nily found plausible legal defects.” H.J.S. App. 313a. The \ncourt noted that it reviewed all pending VRA §5 objec-\ntions, including claims of discriminatory purpose, under \n“the low ‘not insubstantial’ standard” this Court articu-\nlated. Id. \n\n \n \n\f8 \n\nStarting  with  the  congressional  plan,  the  district \ncourt  imposed  as  its  interim  plan  Plan  C235,  which  re-\nconfigured nine of the 36 congressional districts from the \nState’s  2011  plan.  C.J.S.  App.  367a-423a.  In  a  56-page \nopinion, the court concluded that Plan C235 “sufficiently \nresolves the ‘not insubstantial’ § 5 claims and that no § 2 \nor  Fourteenth  Amendment  claims  preclude  its  ac-\nceptance  under  a  preliminary  injunction  standard.”  Id. \nat  396a.  In  doing  so,  the  court  specifically  found  that \n“C235  is  not  purposefully  discriminatory.”  Id.  at  408a. \nThe court devoted 13 pages to explaining why plaintiffs \nwere not likely to succeed on their claims concerning two \ndistricts that Plan C235 did not change—CD27, based in \nCorpus Christi, and CD35, linking Austin and San Anto-\nnio.3 As to the former, the court spent six pages explain-\ning why CD27 did not intentionally dilute minority voting \nstrength. See id. at 417a-423a. As to the latter, the court \nspent seven explaining why CD35 was not a racial gerry-\nmander. See id. at 408a-417a. \n\nThe district court imposed Plan H309 as its interim \nHouse plan. Plan H309 reconfigured 28 of the State’s 150 \nstate-house districts. H.J.S. App. 300a. The district court \nexpressly  declined,  however,  to  reconfigure  the  state-\nhouse  districts  in  Bell,  Dallas,  Nueces,  and  Tarrant \nCounties, id. at 314a, finding that the plaintiffs were not \nlikely to succeed on their §2 vote dilution claims and that \nany §5 claims were insubstantial. Id. at 308a-309a.  \n\n3  This  brief  refers  to  congressional  districts  by  the  abbrevia-\ntion  “CD”  followed  by  the  district  number.  It  refers  to  state-\nhouse districts by the abbreviation “HD” followed by the dis-\ntrict number. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f9 \n\nD.  After the Texas district court imposed its interim \nplans,  the  D.C.  district  court  denied  VRA  §5  preclear-\nance to the 2011 plans. See Texas v. United States, 887 \nF. Supp.  2d  133  (D.D.C.  2012), vacated,  133 S.  Ct.  2885 \n(2013)  (mem.).  Although  the  plaintiffs  asked  the  Texas \ncourt to modify its court-ordered plans based on the D.C. \ncourt’s  preclearance  decision,  the  court  declined.  This \nCourt  then  denied  an  application  to  stay  Plan  C235  in \nlight  of  the  preclearance  denial,  LULAC  v.  Perry,  133 \nS. Ct. 96 (2012) (mem.), and the State conducted its 2012 \nelections under the court-ordered Plans C235 and H309.  \nE.  Although the State appealed the D.C. court’s pre-\nclearance  decision,  before  that  appeal  could  be  consid-\nered, state officials began to urge the Legislature to con-\nsider a different path forward—one that could bring cer-\ntainty  to  the  State’s  elections  and  avoid  several  more \nyears of protracted litigation. The Texas Attorney Gen-\neral implored the Legislature that “the best way to rem-\nedy the violations found by the D.C. court is to adopt the \ncourt-drawn interim plans as the State’s permanent re-\ndistricting  maps.”  C.J.S.  App.  432a.  As  he  further  ex-\nplained,  permanently  adopting  the  court-ordered  plans \nwould “confirm the legislature’s intent for a redistricting \nplan that fully comports with the law.” Id. at 429a. Ech-\noing the same view, on May 27, 2013, the Governor called \nthe Legislature into a special session “[t]o consider leg-\nislation which ratifies and adopts the interim redistrict-\ning plans ordered by the federal district court.” Procla-\nmation by the Governor, No. 41-3324 (May 27, 2013). \n\n \n \n\f10 \n\nThe  Legislature  decided  to  follow  that  advice:  On \nJune 21 and 23, 2013, it formally repealed the 2011 redis-\ntricting  plans,  adopted  the  court-ordered  Plan  C235  in \nfull, and adopted the court-ordered Plan H309 with mi-\nnor changes as Plan H358. On June 26, 2013, the Gover-\nnor signed into law the bills adopting Plan C235 and Plan \nH358.4  \n\nF.  After the Legislature repealed the 2011 plans, the \nState  moved  to  dismiss  the  plaintiffs’  claims  against \nthose  plans  as  moot,  as  the  plans  they  challenged  no \nlonger existed. J.A. 59a. The district court summarily de-\nnied that motion without even waiting for the plaintiffs \nto respond. J.A. 60a. The district court then granted the \nplaintiffs  leave  to  amend  their  complaints  to  assert \nclaims  against  the  newly  enacted  plans—i.e.,  claims \nagainst  the  same  districts  that  the  court  itself  had  im-\nposed on the State for the 2012 elections, plus one state-\nhouse district (HD90) that had been modified slightly in \n2013. J.A. 62a-63a. But instead of adjudicating those new \nchallenges to the plans that were actually in effect, the \ncourt  allowed  the  plaintiffs  to  continue  pursuing  their \nclaims  against  the  2011  plans—plans  that had  been  re-\npealed  and  that  had  never  taken  effect.  The  court  also \ngranted the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaints to \n\n4 On June 25, 2013, this Court held VRA §4(b)’s coverage for-\nmula  unconstitutional.  Shelby  County  v.  Holder,  133  S.  Ct. \n2612, 2631 (2013). The Court later vacated the judgment in the \nD.C. preclearance lawsuit and remanded for further proceed-\nings in light of Shelby County. Texas v. United States, 133 S. \nCt.  2885  (2013)  (mem.).  The  preclearance  litigation  was  ulti-\nmately dismissed as moot. C.J.S. App. 10a. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f11 \n\nseek  preclearance  bail-in  under  VRA  §3  based  on  the \n2011  plans—once  again  rejecting  the  State’s  argument \nthat claims against those plans were moot. J.A. 62a-63a.5 \nThe district court then conducted a second trial on claims \nchallenging the repealed 2011 House plan, J.A. 87a-89a, \nas  well  as  a  second  trial  on  claims  challenging  the  re-\npealed 2011 congressional plan, J.A. 91a-93a.  \n\nAt the same time that it continued to adjudicate moot \nchallenges  to  the  defunct  2011  plans,  the  district  court \nrefused plaintiffs’ requests to enjoin the plans enacted by \nthe Legislature in 2013. J.A. 52a-53a, 94a. As a result, the \nState conducted elections under the legislatively adopted \n2013 plans in 2014 and 2016. \n\nG.  More than two years after the second trial on the \n2011 plans, and almost four years after those plans had \nbeen  repealed,  the  district  court  issued  opinions  hold-\ning—by  a  2-1  vote—that  the  plaintiffs’  claims  against \nthose plans were not moot, that the 2011 Legislature en-\ngaged in  intentional  racial  discrimination  and  unconsti-\ntutional racial gerrymandering, and that the 2011 plans \nhad the effect of diluting minority voting strength in vio-\nlation  of  VRA  §2.  C.J.S.  App.  330a-331a;  H.J.S.  App. \n275a. The majority also found that the plaintiffs proved \n“one  person,  one  vote  Larios-type  claims”  in  discrete \nportions of Plan H283, id. at 276a, but rejected statewide \none-person, one-vote claims, id. at 272a.  \n\n5 The United States intervened to assert claims against the re-\npealed  2011  plans  but  did  not  assert  any  claims  against  the \n2013 plans. J.A. 62a. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f12 \n\nJudge Smith dissented as to both jurisdiction and the \nmerits. He explained that the plaintiffs’ challenges to the \n2011 plan were moot because those plans were repealed \nin 2013 and, indeed, had never taken effect. C.J.S. App. \n336a-349a; H.J.S. App. 280a. On the merits, he explained \nthat  the  majority’s  opinion  “concoct[ed]  the  most  ex-\ntreme possible reading of the raw record to justify find-\nings  that,  if  converted  to  corresponding  remedies,  will \nhand these plaintiffs pretty much everything they have \nsought, causing a wholesale revision in the State House \nand  Congressional  maps.”  H.J.S.  App.  278a-279a.  He \nnoted that the majority’s factual findings were legally in-\nfirm, but “even under the clearly-erroneous test, the ma-\njority’s findings are fatally infected, from start to finish.” \nH.J.S. App. 278a.6  \n\nH.  Having spent four years adjudicating moot chal-\nlenges  to  the  repealed  2011  plans,  the  district  court  fi-\nnally turned to the plaintiffs’ challenges to the operative \n2013  plans  (Plans  C235  and  H358),  holding  a  trial  on \nthose claims in July 2017. C.J.S. App. 14a. In sharp con-\ntrast to the two years the court spent reaching resolution \nfollowing  the  trial  on  the  defunct  2011  plans,  the  court \nissued a divided decision on Plan C235 a mere month af-\nter  the  trial  ended.  Id.  at  14a  n.13,  119a.  Remarkably, \neven though that plan was identical to the one the court \nitself imposed in 2012, the court invalidated two districts \n\n6  Judge  Smith  concurred,  however,  in  the  majority’s  narrow \nconclusion,  with  respect  to  one-person,  one-vote  claims,  that \nthe 2011 Legislature “erred in assuming . . . that the ten-per-\ncent test offers an unassailable safe haven.” H.J.S. App. 278a \nn.1. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f13 \n\nin Plan C235 on the ground that they were the product \nof  intentional  discrimination.  The  court  concluded  that \nthe  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional  vote  dilution  by \nadopting CD27 even though the court-ordered plan left \nCD27  unchanged  after  considering  its  alleged  infirmi-\nties, and engaged in racial gerrymandering by adopting \nCD35 even though the court-ordered plan preserved that \ndistrict over objections as well. Id. at 117a-118a. \n\nOne  week  later,  the  district  court  issued  an  opinion \ninvalidating  certain  state-house  districts  in  Plan  H358. \nH.J.S.  App.  7a  n.5,  84a-85a.  Here,  too,  the  court  con-\ncluded  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional  dis-\ncrimination  by  preserving  verbatim  several  districts \nfrom the district court’s own 2012 interim map—specifi-\ncally,  HD54  and  HD55  (Bell  County);  HD103,  HD104, \nand  HD105  (Dallas  County);  and  HD32  and  HD34 \n(Nueces County). Id. at 85a. The district also found “a §2 \nresults violation insofar as two compact [Hispanic citizen \nvoting-age  population  (HCVAP)]-majority  opportunity \ndistricts could be drawn within Nueces County.” Id. But \nthe district court itself simultaneously recognized that it \nwas  not  possible  to  draw  two  performing  majority-mi-\nnority  districts  within  Nueces  County,  id.  at  49a-50a \n(noting  that  attempts to  draw two  such districts  within \nNueces  County  left  Hispanic  voters  “essentially  worse \noff than under Plan H358 because one district would not \nperform  at  all  and  one  performed  poorly  (compared  to \nPlan H358, where one district does perform consistently \nfor Latinos)”), and the court declined to find “that § 2 re-\nquires breaking the County Line Rule to draw such dis-\ntricts.”  Id.  at  85a.  Finally,  turning  to  HD90  (Tarrant \n\n \n \n\f14 \n\nCounty), one of the very few districts that the 2013 Leg-\nislature had altered as compared to the court-ordered re-\nmedial map, the district court rejected the plaintiffs’ in-\ntentional-vote-dilution  claim  but  sustained  their  racial-\ngerrymandering  claim—even  though  the  2013  Legisla-\nture  had  redrawn  HD90  to  address  vote-dilution  con-\ncerns raised by plaintiffs in this very case. Id.  \n\nWhile the district court declined to style either of its \nopinions as an “injunction,” each one invalidated aspects \nof  the  State’s  maps,  and  each  gave  the  Governor  only \nthree business days to order a special session of the Leg-\nislature to draw a new map. If the Governor declined to \ndo so, the orders compelled defendants to prepare reme-\ndial map proposals and appear at hearings mere weeks \nlater  to  redraw  Texas’s  maps.  H.J.S.  App.  86a;  C.J.S. \nApp.  118a-119a.  Because  the  deadline  for  finalizing  all \ndistricts for the 2018 election cycle was fast approaching, \nand  the  district  court’s  orders  made  plain  that  Texas \ncould  not  use  its  existing  maps  in  the  impending  elec-\ntions,  Texas  sought  and  obtained  stays  of  both  orders \npending appeal. Abbott v. Perez, 138 S. Ct. 49 (2017). \n\n \n \n \n \n\f15 \n\nS U M M A R Y  O F  A R G U M E N T \n\nIn  2013,  the  Texas  Legislature  adopted  court-or-\ndered  remedial  districts  as  its  own.  The  federal  court \nthat fashioned those remedial districts did so based on a \nmandate from this Court to “draw interim maps that do \nnot  violate  the  Constitution  or  the  Voting  Rights  Act.” \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 396. Yet having drawn maps pursuant \nto  a  mandate  to  avoid  even  likely  infirmities,  the  same \ncourt deemed those same districts, once adopted as state \nlaw by the Legislature, to constitute intentional discrim-\nination on the basis of race. That conclusion “sounds ab-\nsurd, because it is.” Sekhar v. United States, 133 S. Ct. \n2720, 2727 (2013). There is not a shred of support for the \ndistrict court’s novel theory that a legislature engages in \nintentional discrimination by failing to “remove” the pur-\nported “discriminatory taint” from the court’s own maps \nbefore  embracing  them  as  its  own.  The  district  court’s \ndecision defies law and logic and cannot be sustained. \n\nI.  This  Court’s  jurisdiction  is  clear.  The  district \ncourt’s  orders  are  appealable  interlocutory  orders  be-\ncause  they  have  the  “practical  effect”  of  an  injunction. \nCarson v. Am. Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 83 (1981). Not \nonly did those orders conclusively find the State’s 2013 \ncongressional and state-house redistricting plans unlaw-\nful; they had the immediate practical effect of precluding \nthe State from using those duly enacted maps in the up-\ncoming elections and putting the state on the clock to use \nor  lose  its  sovereign  authority  to  enact  new  maps.  The \nbest evidence of that is the district court’s extraordinary \ndirection  giving  the  Governor  just  three  days  to  recall \nthe  Legislature  or  otherwise  participate  in  the  district \n\n \n \n\f16 \n\ncourt’s efforts to draw new judicial maps for the impend-\ning elections. The only conceivable explanation for such \nextreme haste and such an extraordinary demand is that \nthe court had foreclosed use of the 2013 maps in the im-\npending  2018  election  cycle,  which  was  set  to  kick  off \nweeks  later.  Accordingly,  while  the  district  court  may \nhave steered clear of using the magic word “injunction,” \nthat does not obscure the fact that the court’s orders had \nthe practical effect of blocking the State from using its \nmaps in any future elections and gave the State only the \nbriefest  of  intervals  to  exercise  its  sovereign  authority \nover  redistricting,  which  is  plainly  sufficient  for  this \nCourt’s jurisdiction. \n\nII.  The central question on the merits is whether the \nTexas Legislature engaged in intentional discrimination \nwhen  it  adopted  districts  imposed  by  the  district  court \nitself. Plainly, it did not. A legislature does not engage in \nracial  gerrymandering  (or  intentional  vote  dilution)  by \nembracing,  as  its  own,  districts  that  a  federal  court or-\ndered  the  State  to  use  after  expressly  concluding  that \nthey sufficed to address every “plausible” constitutional \nor statutory objection. \n\nAll  of  the  evidence  confirms  the  commonsense  con-\nclusion that the Legislature enacted the court’s own re-\nmedial  districts  because  it  took  the  court  at  its  word \nwhen  it  concluded  that  those  maps  complied  with  the \nConstitution and the VRA and redressed every “plausi-\nble” claim otherwise. The plaintiffs’ intentional-discrimi-\nnation claims thus should have failed even without refer-\nence to the strong “presumption of good faith” and “ex-\ntraordinary caution” that applies in this context. Miller \n\n \n \n\f17 \n\nv. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). With that presump-\ntion, the question is not close.  \n\nThe  district  court  concluded  otherwise  based  on  its \nnovel  view  that  the  Legislature  was  required  to  prove \nthat  it  “removed”  the  “taint  of  discriminatory  intent” \nthat  purportedly  infected  the  court’s  interim  maps  be-\nfore the Legislature embraced them as its own. That rea-\nsoning is wrong at every turn. It ignores settled law es-\ntablishing  that  it  is  the  plaintiffs’  burden  to  prove  that \nthe  Legislature  invidiously  and  intentionally  sought  to \nharm minority voters because of their race, not defend-\nants’ burden to prove that the Legislature did not. It con-\nfuses  discriminatory  effect,  which  at  least  is  capable  of \nbeing carried over from one law to another, with discrim-\ninatory  intent,  which  decidedly  is  not.  The  district \ncourt’s  reasoning  even  compels  the  bizarre  conclusion \nthat  the  district  court  itself  engaged  in  intentional  dis-\ncrimination when it imposed its 2012 interim maps. And \nit is not even right on its own terms because the districts \nincorporated  in  the  district  court’s  interim  maps  were \nnot infected with discriminatory “taint” in the first place. \nAccordingly, the district court’s decision invalidating on \nracial-gerrymandering  and \nintentional-vote-dilution \ngrounds multiple districts that the Legislature adopted \nverbatim from the court’s interim maps cannot stand.  \n\nIII.  The  district  court’s  invalidation  of  one  state-\nhouse district on discriminatory-effects grounds, and its \ninvalidation on racial-gerrymandering grounds of one of \nthe  very  few  state-house  districts  that  the  Legislature \nactually changed in 2013 suffer equally fatal defects.  \n\n \n \n\f18 \n\nAs  to  the  former,  this  Court’s  precedent  confirms \nthat  VRA  §2  requires  additional  majority-minority  dis-\ntricts to be drawn only if they are compact, have at least \na 50% minority population, and would actually perform \nin  electing  minority-preferred  candidates.  The  district \ncourt  itself  acknowledged  (as  did  the  plaintiffs)  that  it \nwas  not possible  to draw  another  performing  minority-\nopportunity district in Nueces County, which suffices to \ninvalidate  the  court’s  inexplicable  conclusion  that  the \nLegislature caused vote dilution by failing to do so.  \n\nAs  for  the  latter,  the  Legislature  altered  HD90  in \nTarrant County in 2013 because plaintiffs in this case in-\nsisted  that  the  district  must  maintain  a  Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration  majority  to  avoid  vote  dilution \nunder  VRA  §2.  The  plaintiffs  then  turned  around  and \nclaimed  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  racial  gerry-\nmandering when it responded to that specific concern by \nmaintaining  HD90’s  Spanish-surname-voter-registra-\ntion  majority.  Worse  still,  the  district  court  sustained \nthat remarkable charge on the theory that VRA-compli-\nance is just “a vague goal” that does not justify intention-\nally  drawing  a  majority-minority  district.  H.J.S.  App. \n81a. To state the obvious, a legislature does not engage \nin  impermissible  racial  gerrymandering  by  relying  on \nrace for the limited purpose of addressing a specific com-\nplaint about potential vote dilution. \n\n \n \n\f19 \n\nA R G UM E N T \n\nI.  This Court Has Jurisdiction to Review the District \nCourt’s Orders Because They Have the “Practical \nEffect”  of  Enjoining  the  State’s  Redistricting \nPlans.  \n\nThis  Court has  jurisdiction  because the  three-judge \ndistrict  court’s  orders  constitute  interlocutory  injunc-\ntions,  which  may be  appealed  directly  to this  Court.  28 \nU.S.C. §1253. This Court has made clear that appellate \njurisdiction turns on the “practical effect” of a court’s in-\nterlocutory orders, not labels or form. Carson, 450 U.S. \nat 83. Courts thus have consistently held that “[e]ven if \nan order does not by its terms grant or deny a specific \nrequest for  an injunction  . . .  the  order  may still be  ap-\npealable if it has the ‘practical effect’ of doing so.” Sala-\nzar ex rel. Salazar v. Dist. of Columbia, 671 F.3d 1258, \n1261-62 (D.C. Cir. 2012); see, e.g., Thomas ex rel. D.M.T. \nv. Sch. Bd. St. Martin Par., 756 F.3d 380, 384 (5th Cir. \n2014);  Etuk  v.  Slattery,  936  F.2d  1433,  1440  (2d  Cir. \n1991).  Whether  a  court  labels  an  order  an  “injunction” \ntherefore  makes  no  difference;  otherwise  courts  could \nput off review of their decisions through the simple ex-\npedient of omitting magic words.  \n\nThat rule has particular force in the redistricting con-\ntext, where the next election must take place and must \ntake place  under some  map.  In  that  context, a  decision \ninvalidating the map adopted by the legislature and used \nin previous elections not only prohibits the use of those \nmaps in the upcoming elections, but implicitly or explic-\nitly puts the state government on the clock to enact a re-\n\n \n \n\f20 \n\nplacement map forthwith or lose its opportunity to exer-\ncise  its  sovereign  authority  over  redistricting.  Here,  of \ncourse, the district court made this explicit by giving the \nGovernor  just  three  days  to  order  a  special  session  or, \nfailing that, directing the State to participate in the judi-\ncial map-drawing process. Such a use-it-or-lose-it order \nto the sovereign has the practical effect of an injunction \nand  reinforces  that  the  order  invalidating  the  legisla-\ntively drawn maps operates as an injunction prohibiting \ntheir use in the upcoming election.  \n\nThe orders here are plainly appealable. While the dis-\ntrict court did not label its orders “injunctions,” those or-\nders had the unambiguous “practical effect” of prohibit-\ning the State from conducting any future elections under \nits  duly  enacted  redistricting  plans.  A  mere  one  month \nafter trial on these plans, the district court conclusively \nheld  that  districts  in  Plans  C235  and  H358  violate  the \nConstitution  or  the  VRA,  and  it  conclusively  held  that \nthose “statutory and constitutional violations” “now re-\nquire a remedy.” C.J.S. App. 118a; H.J.S. App. 84a (em-\nphasis added). The district court then expressly ordered \nthat, if the Legislature did not redraw both maps imme-\ndiately,  the  court  would  do  so  itself.  Indeed,  the  court \ngave  the  Governor  just  three  business  days  to  decide \nwhether  to  call  the  Legislature  into  special  session  to \ndraw new maps. And in the event the Governor declined \nto meet that court-imposed deadline, the court ordered \nthe parties to consult with map-drawing experts, confer \nwith each other, and come prepared to offer proposed re-\nmedial  plans  on  September  5  and  6,  2017.  C.J.S.  App. \n118a-119a; H.J.S. App. 86a.  \n\n \n \n\f21 \n\nThe  reason  for  this haste  was  clear:  The  October  1, \n2017 deadline for implementing any changes to the maps \nbefore the 2018 election cycle was fast approaching, and \nthe district court wanted to ensure that it could put new \nmaps in place before that deadline arrived.7 Indeed, if the \ncourt’s orders were not intended to block the State from \nusing Plans C235 and H358 in the impending elections, \nthen there would have been no reason to put the Gover-\nnor under a three-day deadline to haul the out-of-session \nLegislature back to the Capitol on an expedited basis, or \nto order the parties to rush to redraw the maps a mere \n21 days after invalidating Plan C235 and a mere 13 days \nafter invalidating Plan H358.  \n\nThat the district court’s orders had the “practical ef-\nfect”  of  enjoining  any  future  use  of  the  maps  is  under-\nscored  by  the  court’s  response  to  the  temporary  stay \nJustice Alito granted pending completion of briefing on \nthe State’s stay applications. Rather than respond to that \norder by clarifying that it had not yet decided whether \nthe State could still use the maps in the 2018 election cy-\ncle, the district court responded by issuing an “advisory” \nencouraging the parties to continue preparing for its ex-\npedited  map-drawing  hearing  “voluntarily”  so  that  the \ncourt’s own map-drawing efforts could “be resumed ex-\npeditiously” if the stay were lifted. C.J.S. App. 425a. As \n\n7 The State had advised the court in May 2017 that the Secre-\ntary  of  State  must  provide  voter-registration-certificate  tem-\nplates to the State’s 254  counties by October 1 to  give county \nofficials  sufficient  time  to  mail  completed  certificates  to  indi-\nvidual  voters  between  November  15  and  December  6,  as  re-\nquired by Texas Election Code §14.001. See J.A. 380a-381a.  \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f22 \n\nthe district court itself thus made plain, new maps for the \nimpending  elections  were  not  just  a  possibility;  they \nwere a certainty.  \n\nThe district court’s self-serving claim that it “has not \nenjoined  [the  plans’]  use  for  any  upcoming  elections,” \nJ.A. 134a, 136a, is therefore no bar to this Court’s juris-\ndiction. No matter how the court labels its orders, they \nare  injunctions  in substance.  In  fact,  the court’s  orders \nhave the exact same practical effect—conclusively inval-\nidating districts—as the orders in numerous other redis-\ntricting appeals over which this Court has exercised ju-\nrisdiction.  See,  e.g.,  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455 \n(2017); Gill v. Whitford, No. 16-1161 (U.S.). The district \ncourt should not be able to deprive the State of the ability \nto seek the immediate appellate relief Congress intended \nby refusing to admit what its orders have actually done.  \nThe district court’s orders readily satisfy all other as-\npects of appealability analysis. The orders leave no doubt \nabout what has been enjoined or against whom they run. \nCf. Gunn v. Univ. Comm. to End the War in Viet Nam, \n399 U.S. 383, 388 (1970). They “affect[] predominantly all \nof the merits,” Salazar, 671 F.3d at 1262, and alter the \nstatus quo, see Calderon v. U.S. Dist. Ct. for Cent. Dist. \nof Cal., 137 F.3d 1420, 1422 n.2 (9th Cir. 1998); Cohen v. \nBd. of Trs. of the Univ. of Med. & Dentistry of N.J., 867 \nF.2d 1455, 1466 (3d Cir. 1989) (en banc). They are certain \nto  have  “serious,  perhaps  irreparable,  consequence,” \nCarson, 450 U.S. at 84, because they conclusively and im-\nmediately  invalidate  duly  enacted  redistricting  plans. \nAnd  the  orders can  be  “‘effectually  challenged’  only by \n\n \n \n\f23 \n\nimmediate appeal,” id., because appellate review only af-\nter the imposition of remedial maps would come too late \nto prevent the irreparable harm of being prohibited from \nusing legislatively enacted maps in the 2018 elections. In \nshort, the orders below are injunctions in everything but \nname, and as such are immediately appealable under 28 \nU.S.C. §1253. \n\nPractical considerations reinforce the appealability of \nthe  orders  under  review.  While  in  other  contexts  the \nchoice  may  be  between  orderly  review  now  or  later,  in \nthe redistricting context the choice is between relatively \norderly review by this Court after the three-judge court \nrejects the legislative map and puts the sovereign on the \nclock,  or  extremely  expedited  review  after  the  three-\njudge  court  puts  its  own  maps  in  place.  Deferring  this \nCourt’s review, as opposed to facilitating this Court’s re-\nview once the district court has definitively rejected the \nlegislative maps, has little to recommend it from a prac-\ntical  standpoint.  In  addition,  permitting  review  once  a \nthree-judge  court  definitively  rejects  the  State’s  maps \nevens the playing field. If the challengers’ objections to \nthe  legislative  map  had  been  definitively  rejected,  the \nchallengers  would  have  an  immediately  appealable  or-\nder.  But  when  the  State’s  defense  of  the  map has  been \ndefinitively rejected, appellees would have the State wait \nuntil the district court adds the word injunction to its dis-\nposition. That makes little sense, especially given the im-\nmediate interference with the State’s sovereignty when \nthe  State  is  put  on  the  clock  to  use  or  lose  its  primary \nrole over redistricting.  \n\n \n \n\f24 \n\nII.  The Texas Legislature Did Not Engage In Inten-\ntional  Discrimination  When  It  Enacted  Districts \nImposed By The District Court Itself In 2012. \n\nThe  district  court  invalidated  Plans  C235  and  H358 \non the theory that the Legislature engaged in intentional \ndiscrimination when it adopted unchanged districts that \nthe court itself ordered the State to use in 2012 after this \nCourt instructed it to “draw interim maps that do not vi-\nolate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.” Perry, \n565 U.S. at 396. The district court did not reach that re-\nmarkable  result  because  it  identified  some  “smoking \ngun” evidence revealing that the legislature actually be-\nlieved  that  the  court’s  own  interim  maps  discriminated \nagainst  minority  voters.  Indeed,  the court  did  not  even \nconclude  that  the  Legislature  deliberately  set  out  to \ndeny  or  abridge  minority  voting  rights.  Instead,  the \ncourt  concluded  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  inten-\ntional  discrimination  by  failing  to  affirmatively  remove \n(how, the court did not explain) the “taint of discrimina-\ntory intent” that infected the court’s own remedial maps \nthat the Legislature later adopted as its own. That con-\nclusion defies law and logic.  \n\nA.  The Legislature Did Not Engage in Intentional \nDiscrimination When It Adopted the Court-Or-\ndered Districts as Its Own. \n\nAny  effort  to  invalidate  legislation  must  begin  with \nthe  “heavy  presumption”  that  the  law  is  constitutional \nand valid. U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, \n721  (1990).  That  presumption  applies  with  particular \n\n \n \n\f25 \n\nforce in the redistricting context. As this Court has reit-\nerated time and again, “[f]ederal-court review of district-\ning legislation represents a serious intrusion on the most \nvital of local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915, as “reap-\nportionment  is  primarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of \nthe  State,”  Chapman, 420  U.S.  at  27.  Moreover,  courts \nmust  “exercise  extraordinary  caution  in  adjudicating \nclaims that a State has drawn district lines on the basis \nof race.” Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. A claim that a legisla-\nture acted for a constitutionally illegitimate purpose in-\nvolves “a question of much delicacy, which ought seldom, \nif  ever,  to  be  decided  in  the  affirmative,  in  a  doubtful \ncase.” Fletcher v. Peck, 10 U.S. (6 Cranch) 87, 128 (1810) \n(Marshall, C.J.). Accordingly, “the presumption of good \nfaith that must be accorded legislative enactments” ap-\nplies with the strongest of force when a legislature is ac-\ncused of enacting intentionally discriminatory redistrict-\ning legislation. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. \n\nThat  grave  accusation  is  at  the  heart  of  both  inten-\ntional-vote-dilution  and  racial-gerrymandering  claims. \nTo prove racial gerrymandering,  a  plaintiff must prove \n“that  race  was  the  predominant  factor  motivating  the \nlegislature’s decision to place a significant number of vot-\ners within or without a particular district.” Id. To prove \nintentional vote dilution, a plaintiff must prove not only \nthat the challenged law has the discriminatory “effect of \ndiluting minority voting strength,” but also that the law \nwas  enacted  for  a  “discriminatory  purpose.”  See,  e.g., \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (emphasis added). \nThe standard for demonstrating the requisite impermis-\nsible intent is appropriately high: \n\n \n \n\f26 \n“Discriminatory  purpose” . . .  implies  more  than  in-\ntent  as  volition  or  intent  as  awareness  of  conse-\nquences. . . . It implies that the decisionmaker . . . se-\nlected  or  reaffirmed  a particular  course  of  action  at \nleast in part “because of,” not merely “in spite of,” its \nadverse effects upon an identifiable group. \n\nPers. Adm’r of Mass. v. Feeney, 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979). \nAnd  where  there  are  “legitimate  reasons”  for  govern-\nment action, courts may “not infer a discriminatory pur-\npose.” McCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 299 (1987). \n\nApplying those exacting standards, this should have \nbeen an easy case. In 2013, the Legislature chose to en-\nact districts that had been imposed by a federal court op-\nerating  under  a  mandate  from  this  Court  to  “draw  in-\nterim  maps  that  do  not  violate  the  Constitution  or  the \nVoting Rights Act.”  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  396. Abiding  by \nthat instruction, the district court imposed interim maps \nthat, by its own telling, remedied not just all actual con-\nstitutional  or  VRA  violations  in  the  2011  plans,  but  all \n“plausible legal defects” in those plans. H.J.S. App. 313a \n(emphasis  added).  And  the  court  expressly  confirmed \nthat its “interim plan . . . does not incorporate any portion \nof the State map that is allegedly tainted by discrimina-\ntory  purpose.”  H.J.S.  App.  305a;  see  also  C.J.S.  App. \n408a (“C235 is not purposefully discriminatory”).  \n\nTaking the court at its word, the Legislature repealed \nthe  2011  plans,  enacted  unchanged  the  court-ordered \nPlan C235, and enacted a House plan that made only mi-\nnor  changes  to  court-ordered  Plan  H309.  The  Legisla-\nture was not coy about its reasons for repealing the 2011 \nplans and embracing the court-ordered remedial plans as \n\n \n \n\f27 \n\nits own. As the record makes clear, it adopted those plans \nbecause it believed that doing so was its best chance at \nadopting plans that complied with the Constitution and \nthe  VRA  and  its  best  hope  to  bring  this  litigation  to  a \nclose. Statutory Appendix 35a-36a. \n\nFor  example,  Representative  Darby,  the  Chairman \nof the House Select Committee on Redistricting, opined \n“that  the  court  ordered  interim  maps  are  legally  suffi-\ncient,”  explaining  that  they  “represent  the  District \nCourt’s best judgment as to . . . fully legal and constitu-\ntional  redistricting  plans.”  2017  Joint  Ex.  10.4  at  5,  26. \nRepresentative  Clardy,  another  member  of  the  House \ncommittee, explained: “[I]t’s a good, fair map drawn by \nthree  hard-working  impartial  federal  judges  who  are \nvery  well  acquainted  with  the  law.  Don’t  you  think  it’s \nreasonable that we use . . . those maps?” 2017 Joint Ex. \n13.4 at 151. Senator Seliger, the Chairman of the Senate \nRedistricting  Committee,  likewise  stated,  “The  interim \nplans  remedy,  we  believe,  the  legal  flaws  found  in  the \nfederal court in D.C.” 2017 Joint Ex. 26.2 at A-5. And the \nLegislature  enacted  the  court-ordered  maps  following \nthe Attorney General’s advice that “the best way to rem-\nedy the violations found by the D.C. court is to adopt the \ncourt-drawn interim plans as the State’s permanent re-\ndistricting maps.” C.J.S. App. 432a.  \n\nThese  myriad  state  officials  certainly  had  a  good-\nfaith basis for that belief. After all, it is hard to imagine \nmore persuasive evidence that a map complies with the \nConstitution and the VRA than a district court order ex-\nplicitly finding, consistent with this Court’s instruction in \n\n \n \n\f28 \n\nPerry, that the map does not incorporate any “plausible \nlegal defects.” H.J.S. App. 313a.  \n\nBut that was not even the only assurance the Legis-\nlature  had.  The  Legislature  heard  corroborating  testi-\nmony  from  the  Mexican-American  Legal  Defense  and \nEducational  Fund  (MALDEF),  an  organization  repre-\nsenting  multiple  plaintiffs  in  this  case.  MALDEF  ex-\nplained  how  the  court-ordered  plans  “significantly  im-\nprove[d]”  minority  voting  strength  by  changing  every \ndistrict in which the D.C. preclearance court had found \nintentional  discrimination  under  VRA  §5  and  creating \neven  more  majority-minority  districts  than  that  court \nhad  found  necessary  to  avoid  retrogression.  See  C.J.S. \nApp. 436a-439a.  \n\nDemocratic legislators testified at trial that they had \nno reason to believe that any member of the 2013 Legis-\nlature  acted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose.  Mexican \nAmerican  Legislative  Caucus  (MALC)  Chairman  and \nRepresentative  Rafael  Anchia  testified  that  he  had  no \nbasis  to  say  that  any  member  of  the  Legislature  voted \nfor  Plan  H358  for  a  racially  discriminatory  purpose,  or \nthat  Chairman  Darby or  Speaker  Straus  would  engage \nin  racial  discrimination.  2017  Trial  Tr.  133-34.  In  fact, \nRepresentative  Anchia  testified  that  even  he  did  not \nhave  any  complaints  about  Plans  C235  or  H358  when \nthey were enacted. Id. at 720-21.  \n\nAll  of  that  evidence  readily  suffices  to  defeat  any \nclaim  that  the  Legislature  enacted  the  court-imposed \nmaps into law in a deliberate effort to sort voters on the \nbasis of race, Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, or “because of” any \n“adverse effects” that the plans might have on minority \n\n \n \n\f29 \n\nvoters, Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. To the contrary, the rec-\nord overwhelmingly confirms that the most straightfor-\nward  answer  is  the right  one:  The  Legislature  adopted \nthe court-ordered interim plans in an effort to enact re-\ndistricting  plans  that  complied  with  the  VRA  and  the \nConstitution. Accordingly, plaintiffs’ intentional-vote-di-\nlution and racial-gerrymandering claims would fail even \nwithout  reference  to  the  strong  “presumption  of  good \nfaith” that applies in this context, or the “extraordinary \ncaution” federal courts must employ when faced with a \nclaim that a state legislature has engaged in intentional \nrace-based  discrimination.  Miller,  515  U.S.  at  916.  But \nwith  those  admonitions,  their  claims  should never  have \nstood a chance. \n\nB.  The  District  Court’s  “Remove  the  Taint”  The-\nory  of  Intentional  Discrimination  Is  Funda-\nmentally Flawed. \n\nNotwithstanding  that  uncontroverted  evidence,  the \ndistrict court reached the remarkable conclusion that the \nLegislature engaged in intentional discrimination when \nit adopted as its own the same plans that the court itself \nordered the State to use in the 2012 elections. The court \ninvalidated  two  congressional  districts  and  state-house \ndistricts in three counties that had been adopted verba-\ntim from its own remedial maps—even though the court \nhad  expressly  considered  the  very  same  constitutional \nand VRA challenges to the very same districts five years \nearlier and found that they were unlikely to succeed, ad-\nequately  addressed  in  the  interim  plans,  or  not  even \n“plausible.” H.J.S. App. 313a; C.J.S. App. 423a.  \n\n \n \n\f30 \n\nUnsurprisingly  given  the  record  evidence,  the  dis-\ntrict court did not actually find that the Legislature was \npredominantly  motivated  by  race  when  it  embraced \nthose districts as its own, or that the Legislature enacted \nany  of  those  districts  for  the  express  purpose  of  ad-\nversely affecting minority voters. The court never even \nasked  what  the  Legislature’s  predominant  motive  was, \nor whether it embraced any districts because they would \nharm minority voters. Instead, the court concluded that \nthe Legislature engaged in “intentional discrimination” \nfor  a  different  reason  entirely:  because  it  failed  to  “re-\nmove”  the  purported  “discriminatory  taint”  from  the \ncourt-imposed plans. C.J.S. App. 46a. In other words, the \ncourt  concluded that  the  Legislature  engaged  in inten-\ntional discrimination by enacting plans imposed by the \ncourt itself because those court-imposed plans were pur-\nportedly infected with intentional discrimination. That \nconclusion  suffers  multiple  legal  defects  and  flunks  the \ncommonsense test to boot.  \n\nThe first fatal problem with the district court’s rea-\nsoning is that it vitiates the strong “presumption of good \nfaith” and the “extraordinary caution” courts must em-\nploy  when  confronting  intentional-vote-dilution  and  ra-\ncial-gerrymandering claims. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. The \n2013  plans  are  duly  enacted  legislation  entitled  to  the \nsame presumption of constitutionality that applies to any \nother  redistricting  legislation.  That  presumption  does \nnot disappear just because those were not the first maps \nthe  Legislature  enacted,  or  because  the  district  court \nfound the Legislature’s previous maps deficient (albeit in \nan advisory opinion on moot claims, see infra pp. 42-44). \n\n \n \n\f31 \n\nThat is clear from this Court’s repeated admonitions that \ncourts must “afford a reasonable opportunity for the leg-\nislature to” remedy an invalid law “by adopting a substi-\ntute  measure,”  Wise  v.  Lipscomb,  437  U.S.  535,  540 \n(1978)  (principal  op.)  (emphasis  added),  because  redis-\ntricting is always “primarily the duty and responsibility \nof  the  State,”  Chapman,  420  U.S.  at  27;  see  also,  e.g., \nGrowe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 34 (1993). That rule would \nbe  meaningless  if  “remedial”  redistricting  legislation \nwere treated as presumptively suspect and not entitled \nto the same presumptions of constitutionality and good \nfaith as any other redistricting legislation. \n\nintentional-vote-dilution: \n\nThe  district  court’s  task  here  thus  should  have  re-\nmained the same as in any other case alleging racial-ger-\nto  ask \nrymandering  and \nwhether the plaintiffs proved that the Legislature inten-\ntionally  sorted  voters  on  the  basis  of  race,  Miller,  515 \nU.S. at 916, or enacted the map “because of” its “adverse \neffects” on minority voters, Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. By \ninstead  requiring  the  Legislature  to  prove  that  it  “re-\nmoved”  purported  discriminatory  taint  from  an  earlier \nmap, the court not only asked the wrong questions, but \nreversed the burden of proof entirely. \n\nWhile that alone is reason to reject the district court’s \nanalysis, it is just the first of many problems with requir-\ning the Legislature to prove that it “removed” the pur-\nported “discriminatory taint” of earlier legislation. C.J.S. \nApp. 46a. That reasoning suffers from the equally funda-\nmental  problem  that  it  is  incoherent.  It  is  one  thing  to \nask whether new legislation removes the discriminatory \neffects of previous legislation, for effects may be carried \n\n \n \n\f32 \n\nover (wittingly or unwittingly) from one version of a law \nto  another.  But  it  makes  no  sense  whatsoever  to  ask \nwhether new legislation removes the “taint” of discrimi-\nnatory intent from an earlier enactment. C.J.S. App. 46a.  \nOutside of cases of express, facial discrimination, dis-\ncriminatory intent is not indelibly ingrained in statutory \ntext  or  lines  on  a  map.  It  is  a  question  of  motive  that \nturns on why the legislature enacted the law. The prem-\nise of such claims is that a different legislature could per-\nmissibly adopt the same legislation without a discrimina-\ntory motive. See, e.g., Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, \n225 (1971) (noting that a law invalidated because of im-\nproper motive “would presumably be valid as soon as the \nlegislature  or  relevant  governing  body  repassed  it  for \ndifferent  reasons”).  Thus,  when  a  different  legislature \nadopts  a  court-drawn  map  with  a  different,  non-racial \nmotive, any talk of removing taint from the court-drawn \nplan  (or  the  earlier  legislative  act  on  which  the  court-\ndrawn map was based) is a non sequitur. \n\nThat is clear from the very case on which the district \ncourt  relied  in  concluding  otherwise.  Hunter  v.  Under-\nwood,  471  U.S.  222  (1985),  involved  a  statute  that  had \nbeen in effect unchanged for more than 80 years and ad-\nmittedly had been “motivated by a desire to discriminate \nagainst blacks on account of race” when enacted. Id. at \n233.  While  the  Court  invalidated  the  statute  on  inten-\ntional-discrimination  grounds,  the  Court  expressly  re-\nserved the question of whether the same law “would be \nvalid if enacted today without any impermissible motiva-\ntion.” Id. The Court not only viewed itself as reserving, \nrather  than  deciding,  that  question,  but  did  so  without \n\n \n \n\f33 \n\nsuggesting a need for some kind of exorcism to remove \nthe discriminatory intent of an earlier legislature.8   \n\nMoreover, the 2013 maps were not only enacted by a \ndifferent  legislature  than  the  2011  maps,  but  were \nadopted  after  the  intervening  effort  of  the  three-judge \ncourt enforcing this Court’s mandate to remedy any con-\nstitutional problems. Thus, whatever intentions the 2011 \nLegislature may have harbored, those intentions cannot \nplausibly be deemed to have carried over to the plans im-\nposed by the district court itself just because those plans \ndid not change each and every aspect of the 2011 plans. \nIndeed, by that logic, the court itself must have engaged \nin intentional discrimination when it imposed Plans C235 \nand H309, as the court was just as guilty of failing to “re-\nmove” any lingering “taint” in the 2011 plans as the 2013 \nLegislature was.  \n\nAll of that just goes to show the incoherence that re-\nsults  from  the  district  court’s  approach.  Any  legal  test \nthat leads to the bizarre result that a legislature engaged \nin intentional discrimination by enacting court-imposed \nmaps designed to remedy discrimination cannot possibly \nbe right. After all, there must be some way for a legisla-\n\n8 The Fifth Circuit cases  on which the  district court  relied  do \nnot  support  its  position  either.  To  the  contrary,  those  cases \nreinforce  the  conclusion  that  the  only  intent  that  matters  is \nthe  intent  of  the  legislature  that  adopts  the  challenged  law. \nSee,  e.g.,  Cotton  v.  Fordice,  157  F.3d  388,  391  (5th  Cir.  1998) \n(finding  new  version  of  law  comparable  to  law  invalidated  in \nHunter  constitutional  because,  inter  alia,  legislature  did  not \nenact it for a discriminatory purpose). \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f34 \n\nture to enact redistricting legislation and end redistrict-\ning litigation without getting caught “between the com-\npeting  hazards  of  liability”  under  the  multitude  of  re-\nstrictions  that  govern  redistricting.  Bush  v.  Vera,  517 \nU.S.  952,  977  (1996)  (plurality  opinion).  If  adopting  a \ncourt-imposed interim plan that the court itself declared \nsufficient  to  remedy  all  “plausible  legal  defects”  under \neither  the  Constitution  or  the  VRA  does  not  suffice, \nH.J.S.  App.  313a,  then  it  is  difficult  to  imagine  what \ncould.  \n\nIn fact, the district court’s opinions tellingly provide \nno  clue  as  to  what  the  court  believed  the  Legislature \ncould or should have done to remove the supposed “taint” \nfrom  the  court-ordered  plans.  To  the  contrary,  the \ncourt’s own analysis confirms that, in its view, there was \nnothing  the  2013  Legislature  could  do  to  remove  the \n“taint.” There is no better illustration of that once-bitten-\nforever-damned  mentality  than  the  court’s  analysis  of \nHD90.  Unlike  any  of  the  other  districts  from  the  2013 \nmaps that the court invalidated, HD90 actually was re-\ndrawn by the 2013 Legislature. And the district court ex-\npressly held that the plaintiffs’ intentional-vote-dilution \nchallenge to the redrawn HD90 “fails because of a lack of \ndiscriminatory intent.” H.J.S. App. 84a. Yet, even though \nthe  court  expressly  found  that  the  plaintiffs  failed  to \nshow  that  the  2013  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional \ndiscrimination  as  to  HD90,  the  court  still  found  that \nHD90  was  “tainted”  by  the  purported  intentional  dis-\ncrimination of the 2011 Legislature. H.J.S. App. 83a. As \nthat  confirms,  the  district  court’s  “remove-the-taint” \n\n \n \n\f35 \n\ntheory  not  only  has no  basis in  law  or  logic, but is  ulti-\nmately impossible for a legislature to satisfy. Thus, just \nlike six years ago, the district court here was determined \nto impose “independent map[s]” based on its particular \nview of “the interest of the collective public good.” Perry, \n565 U.S. at 396. \n\nC.  The District Court Did Not and Could Not Find \nIntentional  Discrimination  on  the  Basis  of \nRace. \n\nUnder a correct application of the correct legal stand-\nards, the district court had no basis to conclude that the \nLegislature engaged in racial gerrymandering or inten-\ntional vote dilution when it adopted the court’s remedial \nmaps as its own. In concluding otherwise, the court relied \nprincipally on its view that the Legislature enacted the \ncourt-imposed plans “as part of a litigation strategy,” ra-\nther than because it had “a change of heart concerning \nthe validity of any of Plaintiffs’ claims in either this liti-\ngation or the D.C. Court litigation.” C.J.S. App. 40a, 41a. \nThat is  both  factually misguided  and  legally irrelevant, \nas  it  has  nothing  to  do  with  whether  the  Legislature \nsorted voters on the basis of race or intentionally diluted \nminority voting strength.  \n\nAt the outset, the district court’s characterization of \nthe  Legislature  is  difficult  to  reconcile  with  the  uncon-\ntested evidence that the Legislature adopted the court-\nordered plans because it believed that they remedied any \nvalid  legal  claims. See supra p.27.  Moreover,  to  the ex-\ntent the court sought to attribute impermissible motive \nto the Legislature because defendants have defended the \n2011 maps in litigation, see C.J.S. App. 42a (“Defendants \n\n \n \n\f36 \n\nsought  to  avoid  any  liability  for  the  2011  plans . . . .”), \nthat not only is wrong as matter of fact, but would seem \nto  suggest  that the  very  act  of  defending  allegedly  dis-\ncriminatory  legislation  would  itself  constitute  discrimi-\nnation—a  result  that  is  not  and  cannot  be  the  law,  and \nthat would raise serious due process concerns if it were. \nBut more fundamentally, it is not clear how a legisla-\nture  can  endeavor  to  avoid  potential  VRA  challenges \nwithout considering “litigation strategy.” Nor is it clear \nwhy there is anything remotely sinister, let alone uncon-\nstitutional, about a legislature trying to bring existing lit-\nigation  to  an  end.  A  legislature  that  did  not  take  such \nconsiderations into account to any degree, especially in a \ncontext as fraught with litigation as redistricting, would \nbe  a  poor  steward  of  the  public  interest.  There  is  thus \nnothing  constitutionally  suspect  about  repealing  a  law \nthat has come under constitutional and statutory attack \nand replacing it with a law that likely remedies any per-\nceived legal deficiencies and is therefore likely to termi-\nnate or at least abbreviate ongoing litigation. To the con-\ntrary,  that  is  precisely  the  kind  of  conciliatory  and  re-\nsource-saving  action  that  courts  (and  plaintiffs)  should \nencourage  legislatures  to  take.  See,  e.g.,  Am.  Library \nAss’n  v.  Barr,  956  F.2d  1178,  1187  (D.C.  Cir.  1992) \n(“passing  legislation  designed  to  repair  what  may  have \nbeen a constitutionally defective statute . . . represents \nresponsible lawmaking, not manipulation of the judicial \nprocess”).  \n\nAnd it would make no sense whatsoever to require a \nlegislature  to  confess  the  purported  error  of  its  past \nways—let  alone  confess  the  purported  error  of  a  past \n\n \n \n\f37 \n\nlegislature’s past ways—before treating the decision to \naccede to a court-ordered remedy as the conciliatory act \nthat it is. Much litigation settles without an admission of \nwrongdoing, and forcing a legislature to cry not only “un-\ncle,” but “mea culpa,” is unrealistic and counterproduc-\ntive, not to mention legally unfounded.   \n\nIn  all  events,  even  assuming  there  were  something \nuntoward about embracing a court-ordered remedy “as \npart  of  a  litigation  strategy,”  C.J.S.  App.  40a,  that  has \nnothing to do with racial gerrymandering or intentional \nvote  dilution.  Racial  gerrymandering  turns  on  whether \n“race was the predominant factor motivating the legisla-\nture’s  decision  to  place  a  significant  number  of  voters \nwithin or without a particular district.” Miller, 515 U.S. \nat 916. Intentional vote dilution turns on whether the leg-\nislature enacted a particular district because it intended \nto dilute minority voting strength. See Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. at 641. A legislature does not act with either of those \nimpermissible race-based motivations just because it en-\nacts a court-ordered remedy out of a desire to end litiga-\ntion over whether a different legislature acted with im-\npermissible purpose when enacting different legislation.   \nThe district court seemed to think otherwise because \nit was convinced that the Legislature believed that it had \nsomehow “insulate[d]” the 2013 maps from all legal chal-\nlenges.  C.J.S.  App.  41a.  That  is  simply  wrong.  Defend-\nants do not contend, and have never contended, that the \n2013 maps are immune from judicial review. Their con-\ntention is that any intentional-discrimination challenges \nto  those  maps  must  be  based  on  the  intentions  of  the \n\n \n \n\f38 \n\nLegislature  that  enacted  them—i.e.,  the  2013  Legisla-\nture,  not  the  2011  Legislature—and  must  be  judged \nagainst  the  same presumption  of good  faith,  and  under \nthe  same  “predominant  motive”  and  “because  of  race” \nstandards,  that  would  apply  to  any  other  racial-gerry-\nmandering and intentional-vote-dilution claims. It is the \ndistrict  court’s  failure  to  abide  by  those  settled  legal \nprinciples, not its decision to subject the maps to any ju-\ndicial review at all, with which defendants take issue.  \n\nThe  district  court  made  much  the  same  mistake  in \nplacing great weight on the fact that its decision impos-\ning the interim maps was only preliminary. C.J.S. App. \n42a. That is certainly correct, as the court could not issue \na final ruling on the merits of any claims asserted against \nthe 2011 maps because those maps had not obtained VRA \n§5 preclearance. Not only were the 2011 maps repealed \nin  2013,  but  they  never  even  became  law  because  they \nwere never precleared, and thus “could not cause appel-\nlees  injury  through  enforcement  or  implementation.” \nBranch v. Smith, 538 U.S. 254, 284 (2003) (Kennedy, J., \nconcurring); Connor v. Waller, 421 U.S. 656, 656 (1975) \n(per curiam) (holding that challenged acts “are not now \nand will not be effective as laws until and unless cleared \npursuant to § 5”).  \n\nBut the fact that the court’s decision was not final is \nirrelevant  to  the  intentional-discrimination  question. \nAgain,  defendants  are  not  arguing  that  plaintiffs’  chal-\nlenges to the 2013 plans are flatly barred through some \nsort  of  law-of-the-case  or  estoppel  theory.  Defendants \nsimply  argue  that  the  motivations  of  the  2013  Legisla-\n\n \n \n\f39 \n\nture must be assessed in light of the fact that the Legis-\nlature enacted the 2013 plans only after the district court \nissued  a  decision  explaining  in  exhaustive  detail  why  it \nbelieved  that  those  court-imposed  maps  remedied  all \n“plausible  legal  defects”  in  the  2011  plans.  H.J.S.  App. \n313a. Surely the Legislature could rely in good faith on \nthat  decision  even  though  it  was  preliminary—particu-\nlarly  given  that  the  decision  came  after  the  court  held \ntwo  weeks  of  trial,  received  explicit  instructions  from \nthis Court, considered extensive briefing before and af-\nter this Court’s decision, and heard on remand two addi-\ntional days of argument from all interested parties. \n\nFinally, the district court truly devolved to absurdity \nwhen it criticized the Legislature’s “refusal to consider” \ncreating “coalition” districts9 or violating the Texas Con-\nstitution’s  whole-county  provision10  in  certain  areas. \nC.J.S. App.  40a.  The  court  itself  rejected  the  plaintiffs’ \nclaims  that  the  Legislature  discriminated  by  failing  to \ncreate  coalition  districts  because  the  plaintiffs  failed  to \nprove cohesion between African-American and Hispanic \n\n9 A “coalition” district is a district in which two or more minor-\nity groups must be combined to form a majority of eligible vot-\ners. See, e.g., Perry, 565 U.S. at 398. A “crossover” district, by \ncontrast, is “one in which minority voters make up less than a \nmajority  of  the  voting-age  population”  but  may  nevertheless \nelect  their  preferred  candidates  because  enough  members  of \nthe  majority  “cross  over  to  support  the  minority’s  preferred \ncandidate.” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 13 (2009).  \n\n10 Tex. Const. art. III, §26. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f40 \n\nvoters.11  C.J.S.  App.  117a;  H.J.S.  App.  12a,  26a.  And  it \nexpressly  declined  to  hold  that  VRA  §2  compelled  the \nLegislature  to  violate  the  whole-county  provision.  See \nH.J.S. App. 50a. The Legislature cannot plausibly have \nengaged  in  intentional  discrimination  by  declining  to \ndraw districts that the court itself concluded were not ac-\ntually required by the VRA. The court’s seeming belief \notherwise  is  at  considerable  odds  with  the  skepticism \nthis Court has expressed “of a claim that seeks to invali-\ndate  a  statute  based  on  a  legislature’s  unlawful  motive \nbut does so without reference to the content of the legis-\nlation  enacted.”  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  418 \n(2006). \n\nAt bottom, the district court reached the wrong result \nbecause it asked the wrong question. What matters is not \n\n11  This  was  undoubtedly  correct,  but  the  district  court’s  hold-\ning that the VRA may require coalition districts is unfounded. \nSee  Perry,  565  U.S.  at  399  (“If  the  District  Court  did  set  out \nto  create  a  minority  coalition  district,  rather  than  drawing  a \ndistrict that simply reflected population growth, it had no ba-\nsis  for  doing  so.  Cf.  Bartlett  v.  Strickland,  556  U.S.  1,  13–15 \n(2009) (plurality opinion).”); Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 15 (“Nothing \nin  §2  grants  special  protection  to  a  minority  group’s  right  to \nform  political  coalitions.”).  The  district  court’s  own  opinions \nconfirm that coalition districts present the same practical and \nconstitutional pitfalls that led this Court to hold that VRA §2 \ndoes  not  require  crossover  districts.  See  id.  at  17  (explaining \nthat  crossover-district  claims  “would  place  courts  in  the  un-\ntenable position of predicting many political variables and ty-\ning them to race-based assumptions”); cf. C.J.S. App. 53a-85a \n(considering  extensive  analysis  of  racial  voting  patterns  by \nmultiple  experts  to  determine  political  cohesion  among  Afri-\ncan-American and Hispanic voters). \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f41 \n\nwhether the 2013 Legislature “removed the taint” from \nthe  court-ordered interim  maps before  it  enacted  them \nas its own, but rather whether the 2013 Legislature en-\nacted  those  maps  in  an  avowed  effort  to  sort  voters  on \nthe basis of race, or because they would dilute minority \nvoting strength. Particularly given the strong presump-\ntion  of  good  faith,  and  the  extraordinary  caution  that \ncourts must exercise before concluding that a legislature \nengaged  in  intentional  discrimination  on  the  basis  of \nrace, there is no plausible basis from which a court could \nconclude on this record that the Legislature engaged in \nracial gerrymandering or intentional vote dilution when \nit embraced court-imposed districts as its own. \nIII. The  Court-Imposed  Plans  Were  Not  Infected  By \n\nAny “Taint” Of Intentional Discrimination.  \n\nBecause the Texas Legislature did not engage in in-\ntentional  discrimination  on  the  basis  of  race  when  it \nadopted the district court’s remedial maps as its own in \n2013, the question whether the 2011 Legislature engaged \nin  intentional  discrimination  when  it  enacted  the  long-\nago-repealed 2011 maps is both moot and legally irrele-\nvant. That said, there was no intentional discrimination \nreflected in any district in the court-ordered plans. The \ndistrict  court’s  interim  plans  preserved  the  challenged \ndistricts  from  the  2011  maps  because  the  court  recog-\nnized then what it should have recognized again in 2017: \nthose  districts  were  not  “tainted”  with  any  discrimina-\ntion in the first place.  \n\n \n \n\f42 \n\nA.  The District Court Lacked Jurisdiction to Adju-\ndicate Moot Challenges to the 2011 Plans. \n\nThe  district  court’s  conclusion  that  the  2013  plans \nwere  infected  with  lingering  “taint”  in  need  of  “cleans-\ning”  rests  entirely  on  advisory  opinions  that  the  court \nhad no authority to enter. Article III requires that “an \nactual controversy . . . be extant at all stages of review, \nnot merely at the time the complaint is filed.” Arizonans \nfor  Official  English  v.  Arizona,  520  U.S.  43,  67  (1997). \nAnd where, as here, a lawsuit challenges the validity of a \nstatute, the controversy ceases to exist if the statute is \nrepealed. E.g., Lewis v. Cont’l Bank Corp., 494 U.S. 472, \n477 (1990). If a challenged statute no longer exists, then \nabsent unusual circumstances not present here there is \nno  cognizable  controversy  over that  law,  and  any  cases \nchallenging  it  must  be  dismissed  as  moot.  See,  e.g., \nGrowe, 507 U.S. at 30; Burke v. Barnes, 479 U.S. 361, 363 \n(1987);  Diffenderfer  v.  Cent.  Baptist  Church  of  Miami, \nFla., Inc., 404 U.S. 412, 414-15 (1972) (per curiam). \n\nApplying that settled rule, a unanimous panel of the \nFifth  Circuit—in  an  opinion  authored  by  Judge  Hig-\nginson  and  joined  by  Chief  Judge  Stewart  and  Judge \nJones—held that claims against Texas’s 2011 redistrict-\ning plans “became moot” when the 2013 Legislature “re-\npealed the 2011 plan and adopted the district court’s in-\nterim  plan  in  its  place.”  Davis  v.  Abbott,  781  F.3d  207, \n220 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 534 (2015). Here, \ntoo,  as  Judge  Smith  recognized  in  dissent,  plaintiffs’ \nclaims against the 2011 plans should have been dismissed \nas  moot  once  those  plans  were  repealed.  C.J.S.  App. \n336a-349a. In fact, certain Appellees have acknowledged \n\n \n \n\f43 \n\nthat  “any  challenge  to  the  continued  use  of  Plan  H283 \nwould be moot.” MALC Motion to Dismiss or Affirm 1, \nAbbott v. Perez, No. 17-626 (Nov. 29, 2017).  \n\nAs explained above, the district court never acquired \njurisdiction to enter judgment on the merits of the chal-\nlenges to the 2011 plans because those plans were never \nprecleared. See supra p.38. But in all events, those claims \ncertainly  should  have been  dismissed  once  the  Legisla-\nture repealed them—a reality that the district court it-\nself acknowledged when it stated that it would “evaluate \nthe discriminatory effect of Plan C185 in terms of its ef-\nfect  on  voters  had  it  been  used.”  C.J.S.  App.  265  n.97 \n(emphasis added).  \n\nThe district court did not and could not claim that any \nexceptions  to  mootness  apply.  This  does  not  fall  within \nthe voluntary-cessation exception, as the Legislature did \nnot announce its intention to reenact “precisely the same \nprovision” once litigation ends, City of Mesquite v. Alad-\ndin’s Castle, Inc., 455 U.S. 283, 289 (1982), or to replace \nthe  2011  plans  with  “virtually  identical”  ones,  Ne.  Fla. \nChapter of Associated Gen. Contractors of Am. v. City of \nJacksonville, 508 U.S. 656, 661 (1993). Just the opposite: \nthe  district  court  found  that  the  Legislature  “has  re-\npealed the 2011 plans and does not intend to implement \nthem.”  J.A.  64a  (emphasis  added).  Plus,  given  the  pre-\nsumption of good faith and constitutionality, e.g., Miller, \n515 U.S. at 916, a government’s decision to formally re-\npeal legislation is not viewed with the same “critical eye” \nfor mootness purposes as a private party’s mere change \nin litigation position, Knox v. SEIU, Local 1000, 567 U.S. \n298, 307 (2012).  \n\n \n \n\f44 \n\nFinally, the plaintiffs’ request for preclearance “bail-\nin” under VRA §3(c) does not change the analysis. Pre-\nclearance is a remedy, not a claim or an injury. The right \nto a remedy does not arise until the plaintiff prevails on \na claim, and thus cannot substitute for Article III injury. \nSee Vermont Agency of Nat. Res. v. U.S. ex rel. Stevens, \n529 U.S. 765, 773 (2000) (“an interest that is merely a ‘by-\nproduct’ of the suit itself cannot give rise to a cognizable \ninjury in fact for Article III standing purposes”). Accord-\ningly, to seek bail-in, a plaintiff must first prevail on the \nmerits of a constitutional claim that satisfies Article III’s \ncase-or-controversy requirement. Here, any threat of in-\njury from the 2011 redistricting plans disappeared when \nthe  Legislature  repealed  them.  The  plaintiffs’  request \nthat  the  district  court  reimpose  preclearance  on  the \nState  under  VRA  §3(c)  thus  could  not  keep  their  moot \nchallenges  to  the  repealed  2011  plans  alive.  It  could \nhardly be otherwise: bail-in is a remedy that, if ordered, \nsubjects a state to special rules that undermine its sov-\nereignty;  litigation  to  determine  whether  bail-in  is  ap-\npropriate would be question-begging if the litigation it-\nself subjected a state to special rules that undermined its \nsovereignty.  \n\nIn  sum,  the  district  court  never  had  jurisdiction  to \nforce the State to spend four years defending legislation \nthat was repealed in 2013. Its insistence on doing so was \njust part and parcel of the court’s erroneous and incoher-\nent effort to saddle the State with the burden of proving \nthat the court’s own interim maps removed any lingering \n“taint of discriminatory intent.” \n\n \n \n\f45 \n\nB.  The  Court-Imposed  Maps  Were  Not  “Tainted” \n\nby Intentional Discrimination. \n\nEven setting aside the jurisdictional problem, the dis-\ntrict  court’s  conclusions  regarding  the  invalidated  dis-\ntricts that were also in the 2011 plans are simply wrong. \nIndeed,  the  district  court itself  correctly  rejected  all  of \nthose claims in 2012 when it incorporated those districts \nin  the  interim  plans,  and  the  majority  should  have  fol-\nlowed Judge Smith’s lead in doing so again in 2017.  \n\n1.  CD35 Is Not and Never Was a Racial Gerryman-\n\nder. \n\nTo  prevail  on  a  racial-gerrymandering  claim,  the \nplaintiff must prove that race was “the ‘predominant fac-\ntor’  motivating  the  legislature’s  districting  decision.” \nHunt  v.  Cromartie,  526  U.S.  541,  547  (1999).  If  race  is \nproven  to  be  the  predominant  motive,  then  strict  scru-\ntiny applies. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464. The State satis-\nfies strict scrutiny if it had a “strong basis in evidence” \nto believe that the VRA required it to draw an additional \nminority opportunity district. Id. “[T]he requisite strong \nbasis  in  evidence  exists  when  the  legislature  has  ‘good \nreasons to believe’ it must use race in order to satisfy the \nVoting  Rights  Act.”  Bethune-Hill  v.  Va.  State  Bd.  of \nElections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 801 (2015) (quoting Ala. Legis. \nBlack Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1274 (2015)). \nOf course, the plaintiffs’ racial-gerrymandering chal-\nlenge to CD35 fails at the outset because “the 2013 Leg-\nislature  did  not  draw  the  challenged  districts  in  Plan \nC235.” C.J.S. App. 34a; id. at 115a-116a (“There is no ev-\nidence  that  the  Legislature  again  considered  in  2013 \n\n \n \n\f46 \n\nwhich persons to include within CD35 . . . .”). But even \nassuming  for  the  sake  of  argument  that  race  predomi-\nnated when the 2011 Legislature drew CD35, both its de-\ncision to draw CD35 and the 2013 Legislature’s decision \nto enact a court-ordered plan that retained CD35 would \nreadily survive strict-scrutiny review. The 2013 Legisla-\nture had the best possible basis to believe that retaining \nCD35 was necessary to comply with VRA §2: The district \ncourt itself concluded as much in 2012. C.J.S. App. 423a.  \nCD35  is  a  Hispanic-opportunity  district  that  runs \nalong the Interstate-35 growth corridor between Austin \nand  San  Antonio.  The  configuration  of  the  district  was \nproposed by MALDEF, C.J.S. Supp. App. 315a, and sup-\nported  by  the  Texas  Latino  Redistricting  Task  Force \nplaintiffs, C.J.S. App. 174a, based on their position (not \ndisputed  by  any  plaintiff)  that  VRA  §2  requires  seven \nHispanic-opportunity districts in south and west Texas, \nsee Mot. to Dismiss or Affirm 30, Abbott v. Perez, No. 17-\n586  (Nov.  20,  2017).  Democratic  politicians  also  sup-\nported creating a Hispanic-opportunity district connect-\ning  Austin  with  San  Antonio.  Among  others,  former \nTexas Senators Gonzalo Barrientos and Joe Bernal tes-\ntified  that  CD35  “connects  communities  of  interest,” \nC.J.S. Supp. App. 321a, and that “people in those parts \nof San Antonio [covered by CD35] have more in common \nwith people in southeast Austin than with people in more \naffluent areas of San Antonio such as Alamo Heights (in \nCD21).” Id.  \n\nAfter  considering  the  plaintiffs’  claims  in  2012,  the \ndistrict  court  explained  that  Plan  C235  sufficiently  ad-\n\n \n \n\f47 \n\ndressed the plaintiffs’ claim that VRA §2 required “7 La-\ntino opportunity districts in South/Central/West Texas” \nby  including  seven  such  districts—one  of  which  was \nCD35.  C.J.S.  App.  423a.  The  court  also  acknowledged \nthat  the  Legislature  had  good  reasons  to  create  a  new \ndistrict along the Interstate-35 growth corridor, finding \nit  “undisputed  that  much  of  Texas’s  overall  population \ngrowth occurred in Bexar County and Travis County and \nareas along the I-35 corridor.” C.J.S. App. 408a; see also \nJoel Kotkin, America’s Next Great Metropolis Is Taking \nShape \n2016), \nhttps://perma.cc/VLM7-KMV8 (noting that the I-35 cor-\nridor  “is expanding  more  rapidly  than  any  other in  the \nnation,” and that “no regional economy . . . has more mo-\nmentum than the one that straddles the 74 miles between \nSan Antonio and Austin”).  \n\nIn  Texas,  Forbes \n\n(Oct. \n\n13, \n\nThe  district  court  nevertheless  found  in  2017  that \nCD35  was  racially  gerrymandered,  reasoning  that  be-\ncause  there  is  no  racial  bloc  voting  in  Travis  County \n(part, but not all, of which is included in CD35), VRA §2 \ncould not require the Legislature to include any part of \nTravis County in a minority-opportunity district. C.J.S. \nApp.  176a-177a.12  That  conclusion  cannot  be  reconciled \n\n12  The  district  court  noted  that  CD35  included  territory  in \nTravis County that had been in the former CD25, a crossover \ndistrict.  But  the  court  did  not  find  vote  dilution  based  on  the \nelimination of a preexisting crossover district. See C.J.S. App. \n110a n.83. Nor could it have, as most of the Travis County His-\npanic population in the previous crossover district was placed \nin  CD35,  a  new  Hispanic-opportunity  district,  so  this  popula-\ntion could not possibly have suffered vote dilution. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f48 \n\nwith this Court’s precedent, which required the district \ncourt  to  consider  the  entire  territory  covered  by  CD35 \nas drawn rather than a specific county, part of which is \nnot in the district at issue. See Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. \nat 800 (“The ultimate object of the inquiry . . . is . . . the \ndistrict as a whole.”). Moreover, strict scrutiny does not \nrequire a showing that the VRA in fact required the Leg-\nislature to create the district exactly as drawn; instead, \nit is enough that the Legislature had “good reasons” to \nbelieve  that  the  VRA  required  it.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at \n1464.  \n\nHere, the district court itself concluded in 2012 that \nthe  creation  of  CD35  as  a  minority-opportunity district \nwas necessary to address the Task Force plaintiffs’ VRA \n§2 claims. See C.J.S. App. 409a, 415a, 423a. If the district \ncourt had “good reasons” to believe that CD35 needed to \nbe  drawn  as  a  minority-opportunity  district  to  address \npotential VRA §2 claims, then surely the Legislature did \ntoo. If a Legislature cannot maintain a minority-oppor-\ntunity  district  even  when  a  federal  court  has  expressly \nconcluded that doing so is necessary to remedy a poten-\ntial VRA §2 violation, then States would be left without \nthe  “breathing  room”  to  which  this  Court’s  precedent \nand the Constitution entitles them. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at \n1464 (quoting Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 802).  \n\n2.  There  Is  Not  and  Never  Was  Intentional  Vote \n\nDilution In CD27. \n\na.  The  district  court’s  ruling  that  CD27  was  the \nproduct of intentional vote dilution is equally flawed. As \nexplained, see supra p.25, to establish intentional vote di-\nlution, a plaintiff must establish not only discriminatory \n\n \n \n\f49 \n\nintent, but discriminatory vote-dilutive effect. E.g., Shaw \nv. Reno, 509 U.S. at 641. After all, a legislature’s “moti-\nvations” alone cannot “violate equal protection.” Palmer, \n403 U.S. at 224. And to establish the effects prong of an \nintentional-vote-dilution  claim,  a  plaintiff  must  prove \nthat  there  is  “the  possibility  of  creating  more  than  the \nexisting  number  of  reasonably  compact  districts  with  a \nsufficiently large minority population to elect candidates \nof  [the  minority  group’s]  choice.”  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at \n430 (quoting Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1008 \n(1994)).  For  VRA  §2 purposes,  “a  sufficiently  large  mi-\nnority  population”  means  a  minority  population  of  at \nleast 50%. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 19.13  \n\nThe district court in 2017 correctly found that CD27 \ndoes “not diminish Hispanic voter opportunity for § 2 ef-\nfects  purposes”  because  “no  additional  compact  Latino \nopportunity district could be drawn” in the region. C.J.S. \nApp.  113a.  And  the  court  correctly  rejected  the  notion \nthat “any voter with a § 2 right must be placed into a § 2 \ndistrict,  or  that  Nueces  County  Hispanics  would  have \nhad a right to be included in a Latino opportunity district \nunder any circumstances.” Id. at 112a n.85; see Shaw v. \nHunt, 517 U.S. 899, 917 n.9 (1996). Those findings suffice \n\n13 A group that cannot meet the 50% threshold cannot establish \na  vote-dilution  effect  because  it  is  not  sufficiently  large  to \n“elect representatives of [its] choice,” 52 U.S.C. §10301(b). So \nany  claim  of  unconstitutional  racial  discrimination  against  a \ngroup too small to form a majority would necessarily be a ra-\ncial-gerrymandering claim, requiring proof that race predom-\ninated  in  placing  the  group  within  a  particular  district,  Be-\nthune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 799. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f50 \n\nto establish that Plan C235 did not dilute Hispanic voting \nstrength in this region—in other words, that there was \nno vote dilution.  \n\nThe  district  court  nevertheless  held  that  the  2013 \nLegislature did not “substantially address” the VRA §2 \nchallenges  to  CD27  because  it  “impermissibly  trad[ed] \nthe § 2 rights of Nueces County Hispanic voters for those \nin Travis County, who lacked a § 2 right to a Latino op-\nportunity district.” C.J.S. App. 112a. That conclusion has \nno basis in fact or law. There is no evidence that the 2011 \nLegislature  had Travis  County (or  the  separately  chal-\nlenged  CD35  including  part  of  Travis  County)  in  mind \nwhen it configured CD27, much less that it intentionally \n“traded” voting rights between the districts.  \n\nThe  district  court’s  contrary  conclusion  rests  on  a \nfalse  analogy  to  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  at  429-30, \nwhich held that a State cannot offset the loss of a major-\nity-minority  district  required  by  VRA  §2  by  creating  a \nnoncompact majority-minority district elsewhere in the \nState. C.J.S. App. 180a-181a. But this case does not in-\nvolve “trading” a compact majority-minority district for \na  noncompact  one.  To  the  contrary,  both  the  2011  plan \nand the 2013 plan undisputedly increased the number of \nHispanic-opportunity districts in South and West Texas \nfrom  six  to  seven  by  adding  CD35,  and  maintained  the \nexisting Hispanic-opportunity district based in Cameron \nCounty (formerly CD27, renamed CD34). See Texas, 887 \nF. Supp. 2d at 153 (explaining that CD34 offset changes \nto  CD27  for  purposes  of  VRA  §5  retrogression).  The \nLegislature  did  not  “trade”  Nueces  County  Hispanics’ \n\n \n \n\f51 \n\nVRA  §2  voting  rights  at  all—as  the  district  court  cor-\nrectly recognized when it rejected this exact same theory \nin  2012.  See  C.J.S.  App.  421a  &  n.106.  Nothing  has \nchanged since then.  \n\nb.  In all events, the plaintiffs produced no evidence \nthat the Legislature configured CD27 “‘because of,’ not \nmerely  ‘in  spite  of,’  its  adverse  effects  upon”  Hispanic \nvoters  in  Nueces  County.  Feeney,  442  U.S.  at  279.  The \n2011  Legislature  configured  CD27  based  on  specific, \nrace-neutral requests to make Corpus Christi in Nueces \nCounty (2010 Census population: 305,21514) the anchor of \na  congressional  district  separate  from  Brownsville  in \nCameron  County  (2010  Census  population:  175,02315), \ntwo  major  cities  over  160  miles  apart  with  competing \nports and different media markets. See C.J.S. Supp. App. \n288a-291a. Before 2011, CD27 included both cities, as it \nstretched from Nueces County south to include Cameron \nCounty in the Rio Grande Valley.  \n\nIn hearings held before the 2011 legislative session, \nvoters and political leaders in Nueces County expressed \ntheir desire for a Nueces County-anchored district that \nincluded the coastal counties to the north; similarly, vot-\ners and political leaders in the Rio Grande Valley wanted \na  congressional  district  anchored  in  Cameron  County. \nSee,  e.g.,  id.;  2014  Ex.  D-574.  Multiple  legislators  also \n\n14 See U.S. Census Bureau, QuickFacts, Corpus Christi, Texas,  \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/corpuschristici-\ntytexas/PST045216. \n15  See  U.S.  Census  Bureau,  QuickFacts,  Brownsville,  Texas, \nhttps://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/brownsvilleci-\ntytexas/PST045216. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f52 \n\nsupported separating Nueces and Cameron Counties so \nthat the Rio Grande Valley would get an additional con-\ngressional  seat.  See  Aug.  2014  Trial  Tr.  1076-77;  id.  at \n444-45; 2014 Ex. D-607; 2014 Ex. D-574 at 79. Following \nthis  input,  the  2011  Legislature  created  separate  con-\ngressional  districts  anchored  by  Nueces  and  Cameron \nCounties.  CD34—a  Hispanic-opportunity  district  an-\nchored in Cameron County—provided voters in the Rio \nGrande Valley with the opportunity to elect an additional \nmember.  CD27,  anchored  in  Nueces  County,  included \nthe  incumbent  congressman’s  residence  and  coastal \ncounties to the north. C.J.S. Supp. App. 295a-296a.  \n\nThe district court dismissed this substantial and un-\ncontroverted  evidence  as  playing  only  “a  small  role”  in \nthe  creation  of  CD27,  C.J.S.  App.  193a,  and  concluded \nthat the 2011 Legislature’s true motive was to dilute His-\npanic  voting  strength.  The  court  reasoned  that  Nueces \nCounty Hispanic  voters “were intentionally deprived of \ntheir  right  to  elect  candidates  of  their  choice,”  C.J.S. \nApp.  112a,  merely  because  the  2011  Legislature  was \naware  that  CD27  would  likely  be  a  Republican-leaning \ndistrict and that most Hispanic voters in Nueces County \nwere not Republicans. That is wrong as a matter of law. \n“‘Discriminatory  purpose’ . . .  implies  more  than  intent \nas  volition  or  intent  as  awareness  of  consequences.” \nFeeney,  442  U.S.  at  279.  To  treat  mere  awareness  that \nHispanic  voters  will  be  placed  in  a  Republican-leaning \ndistrict as sufficient to establish intentional discrimina-\ntion on the basis of race would lead to the absurd result \nthat  the  Texas  Legislature  can  never  knowingly  place \nHispanic voters in a Republican-leaning district.   \n\n \n \n\f53 \n\nIn any case, placing Nueces County Hispanic voters \nin  CD27  makes  little  sense  as  a  vote-dilution  strategy. \nWith or without Nueces County voters, it is not possible \nto create more than seven Hispanic-opportunity districts \nin  the  region.  C.J.S.  App.  113a.  So  a  nefarious  map-\ndrawer  would  have  packed  Hispanic  voters  into  those \nmajority-minority districts—rather than place them in a \nseparate district like CD27. Likewise, the district court’s \nconclusion  that  the  Legislature  “chose  to  put  [Nueces \nCounty Hispanic] voters” in CD27 “to protect an incum-\nbent who was not the candidate of choice of those Latino \nvoters,”  id.  at  191a,  is  illogical.  If  anything,  incumbent \nprotection would be a reason to exclude voters unlikely \nto support the incumbent. See, e.g., LULAC, 548 U.S. at \n441. But the Legislature did just the opposite in CD27. \nThe  only  explanation  that  accounts  for  the  Legisla-\nture’s decision to include all of Nueces County in CD27, \nas  opposed  to  a  small  portion  around  the  incumbent’s \nresidence, is that the Legislature wanted to keep Nueces \nCounty  whole  as  the  anchor  of  a  congressional  district. \nThat purpose is permissible, race-neutral, and fully sup-\nported  by  the  record.  There  is  not  a  shred  of  evidence \nthat the 2011 Legislature placed Nueces County in CD27 \nbecause it intended to disadvantage Hispanic voters—let \nalone sufficient evidence to overcome the presumption of \ngood faith.  \n\n3.  The Legislature Did Not Engage in Intentional \n\nVote Dilution in Bell County (HD54). \n\na.  Much  like  with  CD27,  the  plaintiffs’  intentional-\nvote-dilution  challenges  to  the  state-house  districts  in \nBell County fail at the outset because there concededly \n\n \n \n\f54 \n\nis no vote-dilutive effect. It is undisputed that a “major-\nity-minority-CVAP”  district  cannot  be  drawn  in  Bell \nCounty.  H.J.S.  App.  180a.  The  district  court  thus  cor-\nrectly found that there is “no § 2 results violation” in Bell \nCounty. H.J.S. App. 18a. That should have ended the in-\ntentional-vote-dilution-inquiry  too.  See  Shaw  v.  Reno, \n509 U.S. at 641. \n\nb.  Regardless,  there  was  no  basis  for  the  court  to \nfind intentional discrimination either, as the 2011 Legis-\nlature plainly drew the Bell County state-house districts \nwith incumbency and “partisan advantage,” not race, in \nmind.  See  H.J.S.  App.  278a  (Smith,  J.,  dissenting).  Be-\nfore  2011,  HD54  contained  all  of  Burnet  County,  all  of \nLampasas  County,  and  a  small  portion  of  western  Bell \nCounty  that  included  almost  all  of  the  City  of  Killeen, \nwhere  incumbent  Republican  Representative  Aycock \nlived. HD55 included the rest of Bell County, including \nits  eastern  cities  of Temple  and  Belton. Due to  popula-\ntion growth, however, HD54 could no longer include both \nBurnet County and Lampasas County. H.J.S. Supp. App. \n277a-278a.  HD54  would  have  to \njettison  Burnet \nCounty—the  more  populous  of  the  counties—to  keep \nwestern Bell County and Representative Aycock’s home \nin the district. July 2014 Trial Tr. 1727.  \n\nLosing “heavily Republican” Burnet County created \npolitical risk for Representative Aycock, who was there-\nfore “anxious to gain Republican strength and looked for \nplaces that could be done.” H.J.S. Supp. App. 278a. He \nand his colleague from HD55 accordingly reached a com-\npromise whereby HD54 would take from HD55 the Vil-\nlage of Salado in south-central Bell County, a Republican \n\n \n \n\f55 \n\nstronghold,  to  shore  up  HD54  and  Representative  Ay-\ncock’s  incumbency.  Id.  That  undisputed  motivation  be-\nhind  HD54  precludes  any  finding  of  intentional  race-\nbased  discrimination,  as  districting  to  protect  incum-\nbents is a race-neutral explanation, “even if it so happens \nthat the most loyal Democrats happen to be [minorities] \nand even if the State were conscious of that fact.” Hunt \nv. Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 551.  \n\nThe district court clearly erred in concluding other-\nwise. The court complained that a small part of the City \nof Killeen, which happened to include some minority vot-\ners,  was  moved  from  HD54  to  HD55.  H.J.S.  App.  21a-\n22a.  But  dividing  Killeen  was  necessary  to  keep  Lam-\npasas County in HD54, and given Killeen’s very diverse \nand integrated population, dividing the city in any way \nwould  incidentally  affect  some  minority  voters.  Id.  at \n15a.  The  court  also  faulted  Representative  Aycock  for \nobjecting  to  “plans  .  .  .  (such  as  Plan  H202  and  Plan \nH232)  that  would  have  kept  the  City  of  Killeen  more \nwhole in one district.” Id. at 182a. But the substantial and \nunrebutted  evidence  showed  that  Representative  Ay-\ncock declined to support those plans because he wanted \nto preserve his incumbency and maintain his relationship \nwith  constituents  in  Lampasas  County.  July  2014  Trial \nTr. 1744, 1769-70.  \n\nIn any event, the court itself found that “the Legisla-\nture’s intentional failure to create the proposed districts \nwas not intentional vote dilution,” H.J.S. App. 18a, so it \nis  hard  to  see  how  failure  to  support  those  proposals \ncould  amount  to  intentional  discrimination.  In  short, \nthere  is  no  evidence  that  Representative  Aycock,  let \n\n \n \n\f56 \n\nalone  the  Legislature  as  a  whole,  had  the  specific  pur-\npose of harming minority voters when drawing HD54.  \n\nc.  The district court also erred in concluding that the \n2011  Legislature  engaged  in  invidious  vote  dilution  un-\nder the one-person, one-vote doctrine because it failed to \njustify  a  minor  3.32%  population  deviation  between \nHD54 and HD55. Id. at 269a. That conclusion is contrary \nboth to this Court’s one-person, one-vote doctrine and to \nthe record (and, in any event, cannot be attributed to the \n2013 Legislature). \n\nFirst, the district court cited no authority for its ap-\nparent view that a one-person, one-vote violation may be \nfound  based  on  the  deviation  between  two  specific  dis-\ntricts,  as  opposed  to  the  maximum  deviation  among  all \ndistricts in a statewide plan. Relying on Brown v. Thom-\nson, 462 U.S. 835, 842 (1983), the court posited that “the \ngeographic scope of a one person, one vote claim . . . is \nwhatever  the  plaintiff  makes  it.”  H.J.S.  App.  224a.  But \nBrown does not stand for the proposition that plaintiffs \nmay base one-person, one-vote claims on de minimis de-\nviations  in  discrete  geographic  areas.  To  the  contrary, \nBrown simply establishes that a statewide plan may be \nchallenged when one district drastically deviates (there, \nby more than 60%) from the statewide average. 462 U.S. \nat 846. Brown thus provides no support for the district \ncourt’s radical conclusion that States must justify any de-\nviation in any district, no matter how small.  \n\nMore importantly, this Court has never found a one-\nperson, one-vote violation in a state-legislative redistrict-\ning plan based on a deviation as small as the 3.32% devi-\n\n \n \n\f57 \n\nation here. As a general rule, “a maximum population de-\nviation under 10%” constitutes a “minor” deviation insuf-\nficient to “make out a prima facie case of invidious dis-\ncrimination  under  the Fourteenth Amendment  so  as  to \nrequire justification by the State.” Harris v. Ariz. Indep. \nRedistricting  Comm’n,  136  S.  Ct.  1301,  1307  (2016).16 \n“[T]hose  attacking  a  state-approved  plan  must  [there-\nfore] show that it is more probable than not that a devia-\ntion of less than 10% reflects the predominance of illegit-\nimate  reapportionment  factors.”  Id.  Because  it  is  the \nchallenger’s  burden  to  prove  illegitimate  factors  pre-\ndominated—not the State’s burden to prove otherwise—\n“attacks  on  deviations  under  10%  will  succeed  only \nrarely, in unusual cases.” Id.  \n\nRather  than  require  plaintiffs  to  demonstrate  that \nthe de minimis 3.32% deviation they identified between \ntwo districts was the product of illegitimate factors, the \ndistrict  court  faulted  the  Legislature  for  purportedly \n“assum[ing] they could have a 10% deviation without jus-\ntification.”  H.J.S.  App.  240a.  According  to  the  district \ncourt, “deviations may exist, but they must be justified \nby the right reasons.” Id. at 241a. The court then set out \nto  “analyze  whether  the  population  deviations  in  Plan \nH283  are  explained  by  legitimate  legislative  policies  in \nways that justify the challenged deviations,” id. at 199a, \nand faulted the State because statewide “population de-\nviations  were  intentionally  not  minimized  beyond  10%, \n\n16 In contrast, congressional plans are held to a stricter stand-\nard of near-perfect population equalization under the one-per-\nson, one-vote doctrine. E.g., Evenwel v. Abbott, 136 S. Ct. 1120, \n1124 (2016). \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f58 \n\nand were not explained or justified on the legislative rec-\nord during the session.” Id. at 238a.  \n\nThat  reasoning is  flatly  contrary  to  this  Court’s  ad-\nmonition that plaintiffs bear the burden of proving “that \nit is more probable than not that a deviation of less than \n10%  reflects  the  predominance  of  illegitimate  reappor-\ntionment factors,” and that “attacks on deviations under \n10% will succeed only rarely, in unusual cases,” Harris, \n136 S. Ct. at 1307. As Brown and Harris make clear, it \nwas the plaintiffs’ burden to prove that the de minimis \n3.32% deviation between two districts was the product of \nillegitimate  reasons,  not  the  Legislature’s  burden  to \nprove that it was the product of legitimate ones. And as \nalready  explained,  see  supra  pp.54-55,  the  plaintiffs \nplainly failed to meet that burden. \n\n4.  The  Legislature  Did  Not  Intentionally  Dilute \nHispanic  Voting  Strength  in  Dallas  County \n(HD103, HD104, and HD105). \n\na.  As  with  their  other \n\nintentional-vote-dilution \nclaims, the district court should have rejected the plain-\ntiffs’ intentional-vote-dilution claims in three west Dallas \nCounty districts—HD103, HD104, and HD105—for the \nstraightforward  reason  that  there  was  no  vote-dilutive \neffect.  Although  the  parties  disputed  many  factual  is-\nsues, one thing was certain: it was not possible to draw \nadditional  majority-minority  districts \nin  Dallas \nCounty—even with the data available at the time of trial \nin July 2017, more than four years after the Legislature \n\n \n \n\f59 \n\nadopted Plan H358.17 MALC’s own expert expressly con-\nceded this point. 2017 Trial Tr. 48. Moreover, the plain-\ntiffs  failed  to  prove  even  that  additional  coalition  dis-\ntricts—which  are  not  required  by  VRA  §2—could  be \ndrawn in Dallas County. H.J.S. App. 26a (finding lack of \npolitical  cohesion).  Without  “the  possibility  of  creating \nmore  than  the  existing  number  of  reasonably  compact \ndistricts with a sufficiently large minority population to \nelect  candidates  of  [the  minority  group’s]  choice,”  LU-\nLAC,  548  U.S.  at  430  (quoting  De  Grandy,  512  U.S.  at \n1008), there can be no vote dilution. See Shaw v. Reno, \n509 U.S. at 641. \n\nb.   Regardless  of  the  absence  of  a  vote-dilution  ef-\nfect, there is absolutely no evidence that the 2011 Legis-\nlature intentionally discriminated when it drew HD105. \nAs  a  result  of  the  2010  Census,  the  2011  Legislature \nfaced the difficult task of removing two Republican dis-\ntricts  (one  of  which  was  HD106)  from  Dallas  County \nwithout  eliminating  any  existing  minority-opportunity \ndistricts.  H.J.S.  Supp.  App.  222a.  To  give  HD106’s  in-\ncumbent,  Representative  Anderson,  a  chance  to  retain \nhis  seat,  the  Legislature  decided  to  extend  nearby  Re-\npublican HD105 significantly southward into what other-\nwise would be HD104 to include Anderson’s home. Id. at \n229a-230a.  This  allowed  Anderson  to  run  against \n\n17  HD104  is  a  majority-Hispanic  district.  H.J.S.  App.  167a. \nHD103  was  not  a  majority-Hispanic  district,  but  it  was  elect-\ning  the  Hispanic-preferred  candidate,  Representative  Rafael \nAnchia. Id. at 170a. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f60 \n\nHD105’s  Republican  incumbent,  Representative  Har-\nper-Brown,  in  a  relatively safe  Republican  district. Id.; \nJ.A. 454a.  \n\nThe  district  court  tried  to  portray  this incumbency-\nprotection  decision  in  a  negative  light,  claiming  that \n“mapdrawers improperly used race to make HD103 and \nHD104 more Hispanic and HD105 more Anglo.” H.J.S. \nApp. 23a.18 But that makes no sense as a theory of vote \ndilution.  As  the  legislative  staff  member  who  drew \nHD105 explained, he ensured that areas with significant \nHispanic  voting  population  were  kept  in  HD104,  thus \nmaintaining  HD104  as  a  minority-opportunity  district \nwith  a  Spanish-surname-voter-registration  above  50%. \nHe conducted a similar exercise to keep the Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration of HD103 around its benchmark \nlevel of 39%. H.J.S. Supp. App. 227a-229a. Moving His-\npanic  voters  from  HD105  to  HD103  and  HD104  placed \nthem  in  districts  where,  unlike  in  HD105,  they  were \nlikely  to  be  represented  by  Hispanic  candidates  of \nchoice. Id. at 222a, 230a. That is the opposite of minority \nvote dilution. \n\n5.  The  Legislature  Did  Not  Intentionally  Dilute \nHispanic  Voting  Strength  in  Nueces  County \n(HD32 and HD34). \n\na.  There  is  not  and  never  was  any  intentional  vote \ndilution in the state-house districts in Nueces County. As \n\n18  Although  the  district  court  seemed  to  focus  on  the  use  of \nracial  data,  it  did  not  find  racial  gerrymandering,  nor  could \nit—the plaintiffs did not even plead claims of racial gerryman-\ndering in Dallas County. H.J.S. App. 192a-193a. \n\n \n \n                                             \n\f61 \n\nan  initial  matter,  there  could  not  have  been  intentional \nvote  dilution  in  Nueces  County  because,  once  again, \nthere was no vote-dilution effect. See infra Part IV.A.  \n\nb.  Regardless, the record is devoid of any evidence \nof  intent  to  dilute  minority  voting  strength.  Under  the \nplan that existed in 2010, Nueces County contained two \nTexas  House Districts  (HD33  and  HD34)  and part  of  a \nthird (HD32), all of which were represented by Republi-\ncans. H.J.S. Supp. App. 89a-91a. Based on the 2010 Cen-\nsus, a relative decline in population entitled the county to \nonly  two  Texas  House  districts.  See  H.J.S.  App.  27a. \nConsequently,  as  required  by  the  Texas  Constitution’s \nwhole-county  provision,  Tex.  Const.  art.  III,  §26,  the \n2011 Legislature apportioned two Texas House districts \nto  Nueces  County  (HD32  and  HD34).  See  H.J.S.  App. \n27a.  One  of  those  (HD34)  was  drawn  as  a  Hispanic-op-\nportunity district. Id. at 57a. That ensured roughly pro-\nportional representation, as Hispanic voters “are around \n56%  of  the  relevant  population  (CVAP)”  in  Nueces \nCounty.  Id.  at  51a.  The  other  district  (HD32)  replaced \nthe two previous Republican districts with one protect-\ning  the  most  senior  incumbent  of  the  delegation.  See \nH.J.S. Supp. App. 100a (noting seniority).  \n\nThe district court nonetheless found both intentional \nvote dilution and a vote-dilution effect in Nueces County \nbecause the Legislature did not draw “an additional com-\npact  minority  district,”  H.J.S.  App.  54a—that  is,  “two \nHCVAP-majority  districts  wholly  within  Nueces \nCounty,” id. at 59a. This was clear legal and factual er-\nror, as there was no possible way to draw two performing \n\n \n \n\f62 \n\nmajority-minority districts in Nueces County. See infra \nPart IV.A. To state the obvious, the Legislature did not \nengage  in  intentional  discrimination  by  declining  to  do \nthe impossible—particularly given that, had the Legisla-\nture  actually  split  the  county’s  Hispanic  population  in \nhalf, it undoubtedly would have been charged with vote \ndilution.  \n\nThe district court did not and could not explain how \nthis  decision  amounted  to  intentional  vote  dilution.  In-\nstead,  it  rested  its  intentional-discrimination  finding \nlargely  on  a  meritless  one-person,  one-vote  argument \nthat was expressly disclaimed by MALC, the only plain-\ntiff  asserting  claims  against  the  Nueces  County  state-\nhouse  districts.  See  2017  Trial  Tr.  22;  H.J.S.  App.  30a, \n31a n.21. Just like in Bell County, the court found a one-\nperson, one-vote violation in Nueces County based on a \nminor  deviation  between  two  specific  districts—a  mere \n3.63%  deviation  between  HD32  (0.34%  below  the \nstatewide  ideal)  and  HD34  (3.29%  above  the  statewide \nideal). Id. at 254a. As explained above, that alone was le-\ngal  error  because  (1)  it  was  not  a  statewide  maximum-\ndeviation analysis; (2) it is the plaintiffs’ burden to prove \nthat  such  minor  deviations  are  illegitimate, see  Harris, \n136 S. Ct. at 1307; and (3) “attacks on deviations under \n10%  will succeed  only rarely,  in  unusual  cases,” id.  See \nsupra pp.55-58.  \n\nBut  even  setting  those  problems  aside,  the  district \ncourt clearly erred when it assumed that the 2011 Legis-\nlature must have invidiously relied on racial data merely \n\n \n \n\f63 \n\nbecause “HD34 is significantly more Hispanic in popula-\ntion  and  significantly more  overpopulated  than  HD32.” \nH.J.S.  App.  255a.  First,  a  deviation  of  less  than  4%  is \nhardly  “significantly  more  overpopulated.”  Second,  a \ncourt may not assume invidious intent from the mere ex-\nistence of disparate result. See Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279. \nInstead,  it  was  the  plaintiffs’  burden  to  rebut  the  pre-\nsumption of good faith, and prove up their counter-intui-\ntive  claim  that  removing  two  of  the  three  Republican \nrepresentatives from Nueces County and adding a per-\nforming  Hispanic-opportunity \nsomehow \namounted to intentional vote dilution. That, the plaintiffs \nutterly failed to do.  \n\ndistrict \n\n*   *   * \n\nIn sum, the court-ordered districts later invalidated \nby  the  district  court  were preserved  in  the  court’s  own \n2012 remedial maps for an obvious reason: those districts \nwere  not  infected  with  any  discriminatory  “taint”  to \nbegin with. The court itself found as much back in 2012, \nas it was bound to do given this Court’s mandate to “draw \ninterim maps that do not violate the Constitution or the \nVoting Rights Act.” Perry, 565 U.S. at 396. Accordingly, \neven if the intentions of the 2011 Legislature were rele-\nvant,  they  supply  no  basis  whatsoever  for  invalidating \nany  of  the  districts  that  the  2013  Legislature  adopted \nverbatim from the district court’s interim maps.  \nIV. The Two Remaining Challenges To The 2013 Plans \n\nAre Meritless. \n\nThe conclusion that the Legislature did not engage in \nintentional  discrimination  when  it  adopted  the  district \n\n \n \n\f64 \n\ncourt’s interim maps as its own suffices to invalidate the \nbulk of the district court’s holdings, as all but one of the \ndistricts  the  court  invalidated  were  adopted  verbatim \nfrom the court-imposed maps, and each of those districts \nwas  invalidated  on  intentional-discrimination  grounds. \nBut  the  district  court  invalidated  two  state-house  dis-\ntricts on grounds that are not controlled by that analysis, \nfinding a VRA §2 results violation based on a vote-dilu-\ntion effect in one district (HD32 in Nueces County), and \nfinding  racial  gerrymandering  in  the  lone  invalidated \ndistrict  that  was  not  adopted  verbatim  from  the  court-\nordered plan (HD90 in Tarrant County). While defend-\nants  certainly  concede  (contrary  to  the  district  court’s \nclaims) that the 2013 plans were not “insulated” from at-\ntack on those grounds, each of those holdings is legally \nand factually unsustainable.  \n\nA.  There  Is  No  Vote-Dilutive  Effect  in  Nueces \n\nCounty State-House Districts. \n\nThe district court’s 2017 orders sustained only one ef-\nfects claim in the entirety of the 2013 maps, finding vote-\ndilutive  effect  in  HD32  in  Nueces  County.  The  district \ncourt  correctly  rejected  that  very  same  claim  in  2012, \nH.J.S.  App.  303a,  and  the  majority  should  have  joined \nJudge Smith in doing so again in 2017, id. at 298a. \n\nAs discussed, see supra pp.48-49, to establish a vote-\ndilution effect under VRA §2, a plaintiff must establish \n“the possibility of creating more than the existing num-\nber  of  reasonably  compact  districts  with  a  sufficiently \nlarge minority population to elect candidates of [the mi-\nnority group’s] choice.” LULAC, 548 U.S. at 430 (quoting \n\n \n \n\f65 \n\nDe Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1008). To qualify as “sufficiently \nlarge” for the VRA to require the district, the minority \npopulation must be at least 50%, Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 19, \nbut it must also be large enough to actually perform and \nprovide  minority  voters  with  the  opportunity  to  elect \ntheir preferred candidates. See, e.g., LULAC, 548 U.S. at \n428 (noting that “it may be possible for a citizen voting-\nage majority to lack real electoral opportunity”).  \n\nThe  district  court  itself  recognized  that  it  was  not \npossible  to  draw  two  state-house  districts  in  56%  His-\npanic  Nueces  County  with  enough  Hispanic  voters  to \nconsistently  elect  Hispanic  candidates  of  choice.  Plain-\ntiffs’  attempt  to  draw  two  Hispanic-citizen-voting-age-\nmajority districts in Nueces County left Hispanic voters \n“essentially worse off than under Plan H358 because one \ndistrict  would  not  perform  at  all  and  one  performed \npoorly (compared to Plan H358, where one district does \nperform consistently for Latinos).” H.J.S. App. 49a-50a; \nid.  at  55a  (explaining  that  plaintiff  MALC’s  effort  pro-\nduced  “two  HCVAP-majority  districts  that  are  poorly \nperforming or not yet performing”).  \n\nMALC’s own expert testified that he could not “draw \ntwo  districts  wholly  contained  within  Nueces  County \nthat  were  Latino  CVAP  majorities  and  .  .  .  both  per-\nformed for the Latino community.” J.A. 387a. As he ex-\nplained, when he attempted to draw two districts wholly \nwithin  Nueces  County  with  at  least  50%  Hispanic-citi-\nzen-voting-age  population,  one  district  elected  the  mi-\nnority-preferred candidate in only 7 of 35 elections ana-\nlyzed, and the other in none. J.A. 386a-387a; see also, e.g., \n\n \n \n\f66 \n\nH.J.S. Supp. App. 93a (noting Texas Legislative Council \nattorney  David  Hanna’s  conclusion  in  2011  that  it  was \n“highly  unlikely  that  you  can  ever  get  two  performing \ndistricts for Hispanics no matter how you draw them”); \nid. at 94a-95a (suggesting drawing one “clearly perform-\ning”  Hispanic-opportunity  district in Nueces  County  to \navoid retrogression).  \n\nThat  evidence  confirms  that  creating  two  districts \nwithin  Nueces  County  with  at  least  50%  Hispanic-citi-\nzen-voting-age-population would not have created an op-\nportunity  to  elect  the  minority-preferred  candidate  in \ntwo districts. To the contrary, it would result in levels of \nperformance  for  Hispanic-preferred  candidates  “so  low \nas to indicate a lack of real electoral opportunity in both \ndistricts.”  H.J.S.  App.  44a.  Accordingly,  not  only  did \nVRA §2 not require two such districts; if the State had \ntried  to  draw  them,  it  undoubtedly  would  have  been \ncharged  with  vote  dilution.  See  id.  at  96a  (“[A]  50% \nHCVAP district is theoretically an opportunity district, \nbut it may still be challenged by Plaintiffs as not provid-\ning  real  electoral  opportunity.”).  And  the  district  court \nexpressly rejected the plaintiffs’ claim that VRA §2 re-\nquired the Legislature to violate the whole-county provi-\nsion  to  create  an  additional  Hispanic-opportunity  dis-\ntrict.  Id.  at  49a-50a,  59a  (“[B]reaking  the  County  Line \nRule twice to remove Anglos and incorporate even more \nHispanics  to  improve  electoral  outcomes  goes  beyond \nwhat  §  2  requires.”).  That  should  have  been  the  end  of \nthe inquiry.  \n\n \n \n\f67 \n\nInstead, the district court concluded that the Legis-\nlature violated §2 by failing to draw two Hispanic-major-\nity  districts  within  Nueces  County—despite  the  undis-\nputed evidence submitted by MALC itself that such dis-\ntricts would not perform for Hispanic voters—on the the-\nory that MALC failed to prove “that the districts in [its \ndemonstration plan] do not provide real electoral oppor-\ntunity.” H.J.S. App. 55a (emphasis added). That conclu-\nsion is inexplicable. It was MALC’s burden to prove that \ntwo such districts would perform, but MALC conceded \nthat they would not. The Legislature cannot plausibly be \nfound to have caused vote dilution by failing to draw dis-\ntricts  that  MALC agreed  would  have  provided  less  op-\nportunity  to  elect  Hispanic-preferred  candidates  than \nthe districts in Plan H358.  \n\nThe  district  court’s  error  is  confirmed  by  evidence \nshowing that state-house districts in Nueces County do \nnot dilute Hispanic voting strength. Because the existing \ndistricts  provide  proportional  representation,  the  dis-\ntrict court itself recognized that “[c]reating a second [op-\nportunity]  district  would  result  in  over-representation \n[of Hispanic voters] in Nueces County.” Id. at 51a. And \nit  expressly  found  that  “Hispanics  are  being  elected  to \ncountywide offices and as house district representatives, \nindicating a lack of barriers to candidacy and election.” \nId. at 55a, see also, e.g., H.J.S. Supp. App. 111a (“There \nhave been a significant number of Latinos in elected of-\nfice  in  Nueces  County.  Three  of  eight  Corpus  Christi \ncouncil members are Hispanic, as are the county attor-\n\n \n \n\f68 \n\nney, Nueces County district clerk, and three of eight dis-\ntrict  court  judges.”  (citations  omitted)).  The  district \ncourt’s own findings thus confirm that the configuration \nof  Nueces  County  House  districts  does  not  dilute  His-\npanic voting strength.  \n\nB.  The Legislature Did Not Engage in Unconstitu-\ntional  Racial  Gerrymandering  in  Reconfigur-\ning Tarrant County’s HD90. \n\nRemarkably,  the  district  court  not  only  accused the \nLegislature of engaging in intentional discrimination by \nfailing  to  change  the  districts  that  the  court  itself  im-\nposed, but also managed to conclude that the Legislature \nengaged in racial gerrymandering in one of the very few \ndistricts that it did change. That conclusion perfectly il-\nlustrates  the dilemma that  state  legislatures face  when \nthey  attempt  to  balance  the  competing  demands  of  the \nVRA and the Equal Protection Clause. The district court \nin 2012 adopted the previous version of HD90 as a ma-\njority-Hispanic  district;  the  2013  Legislature  drew  the \nreconfigured  2013  version  as  a  majority-Hispanic  dis-\ntrict;  and  plaintiffs  in  this  lawsuit  told  the  Legislature \n(both in 2011 and 2013) that HD90 had to be retained as \na  majority-Hispanic  district.  Yet  the  district court  held \nthat the Legislature did not even have “good reasons” for \nretaining HD90 as a majority-Hispanic district. \n\nThat  conclusion  is  impossible  to  reconcile  with  this \nCourt’s  precedent.  Contrary  to  the  district court’s  con-\ntentions,  “avoid[ing]  a  potential  VRA  problem”  is  not \njust “a vague goal” that fails to provide the “strong basis \nin evidence” to believe “that the VRA require[s] [the] use \n\n \n \n\f69 \n\nof race.” H.J.S. App. 81a. Instead, this Court has repeat-\nedly  recognized  that  “complying  with  operative  provi-\nsions of the Voting Rights Act” is a sufficiently “compel-\nling interest” to justify a decision to redistrict on the ba-\nsis  of  race.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1464  (citing  Shaw  v. \nHunt,  517  U.S.  at  915);  see  Bethune-Hill,  137  S. Ct.  at \n801; Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1272-74. And the State had \nthe  strongest  of  “‘good  reasons’  to  think  that  it  would \ntransgress the [VRA] if it did not draw race-based dis-\ntrict lines” by maintaining HD90 as a majority-Hispanic \ndistrict,  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1464  (quoting  Bethune-\nHill, 137 S. Ct. at 802), as the plaintiffs consistently ar-\ngued that this was the case. \n\nIn 2011, MALDEF urged the Legislature to increase \nthe Hispanic-citizen-voting-age-population and Spanish-\nsurname-voter-registration in HD90 because it was pos-\nsible to create “a clear Latino CVAP majority district” in \nTarrant County. H.J.S. Supp. App. 258a-259a. The 2011 \nLegislature  accommodated  the  request,  raising  the \nSpanish-surname-voter-registration  of  HD90  to  just \nover 50%—in part by moving the predominantly African-\nAmerican  neighborhood  of  Como  into  an  adjoining  Re-\npublican  district.  H.J.S.  App.  68a,  174a.  And  the  2011 \nLegislature was very clear as to why it did so: MALDEF \n[Spanish-surname-voter-registration] \n“testified \nneeded  to  be  above  50%.”  H.J.S.  Supp.  App.  264a.  Be-\ncause Como had been part of the district since 1978, how-\never,  the  2013  Legislature  wanted  to  honor  Como’s  re-\nquest to be moved back into HD90—a request also made \nby  the  Democratic  incumbent  (and  MALC  member), \n\nthat \n\n \n \n\f70 \n\nRepresentative  Burnam.  H.J.S.  App.  71a-72a,  75a,  77a. \nSo in 2013, the Legislature sought to reconfigure HD90 \nfrom the 2012 court-imposed version to accomplish two \ngoals:  (1)  moving  the  predominantly  African-American \nneighborhood of Como back into HD90 as it requested, \nand (2) keeping HD90 as a majority-Hispanic district to \ncomply with VRA §2. \n\nMoving  Como  back  into  HD90  created  a  potential \nproblem,  however,  because  it  would  decrease  the  dis-\ntrict’s Spanish-surname-voter-registration from approx-\nimately 51% to 48.2%. J.A. 399a. And when Representa-\ntive  Burnam’s  chief  of  staff  presented  a  proposed  map \nthat  would  do  just  that,  MALC’s  counsel  expressly  in-\nformed  him  that  MALC  could  not  “support  a  map  that \nbrought the SSVR below 50 percent” because that would \n“substantially dilute[] Hispanic voting power.” J.A. 398a, \n403a. That concern was well-founded, as an elected offi-\ncial from the area stated that even with 50% Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration, it was far from clear that His-\npanic  voters  would be able  to  nominate  their  preferred \ncandidate in the Democratic primary. 2017 Trial Tr. 317. \nIn  2012,  incumbent  Representative  Burnam—who  was \nnot  the  Hispanic  candidate  of  choice,  H.J.S.  App.  69a \nn.45—staved  off  a  primary  challenge  from  Carlos \nVasquez  by  159  votes,  even  though  Spanish-surname-\nvoter-registration  was  above  50%,  id.  at  72a.  And,  in \n2014, challenger Ramon Romero, Jr., defeated Burnam \nin the primary by only 110 votes. Id. at 76a. So lowering \nSpanish-surname-voter-registration by only a few points \n\n \n \n\f71 \n\ncould  make  all  the  difference  for  Hispanic  voters  in \nHD90. \n\nHaving  heard  MALC’s  legal  concerns,  Burnam  in-\nstructed  his  chief  of  staff  to  draw  a  map  that  returned \nComo to HD90 but also kept the district’s Spanish-sur-\nname-voter-registration above 50%. H.J.S. App. 72a-73a; \nJ.A. 401a. Burnam incorporated that proposed map into \nan amendment, which was adopted by the House without \nobjection and incorporated into the plan that was even-\ntually enacted as Plan H358. J.A. 407a. \n\nProving  that  no  good  deed  goes  unpunished,  the \nState then found itself confronted with not one, but two \nlegal  challenges—one  by  MALC  and  the  Task  Force \nclaiming that the Legislature engaged in intentional vote \ndilution by failing to add enough Hispanic voters to now-\nmajority-Hispanic HD90, and another facially contradic-\ntory challenge by the Task Force claiming that the Leg-\nislature engaged in racial gerrymandering by using race \nat all when drawing HD90. H.J.S. App. 70a-71a.  \n\nThe district court correctly rejected the intentional-\nvote-dilution  claim,  concluding  that  HD90  sufficiently \nmaintained Hispanic voting strength as a majority-His-\npanic  district.  H.J.S.  App.  84a.  But  the  court  then  sus-\ntained  the  racial  gerrymandering  claim—even  though \nthe court itself had adopted the 2012 version of HD90 as \na  majority-Hispanic  district—claiming  that  there  was \n“no evidence” of “the amendment’s effect on Latino vot-\ning ability in HD90.” H.J.S. App. 82a. That holding is in-\nexplicable. Not only had MALDEF told the Legislature \nthat HD90 needed to be a majority-Hispanic district, but \n\n \n \n\f72 \n\nMALC expressly opposed any drop below 50% Spanish-\nsurname-voter-registration  because  that  would  “sub-\nstantially  dilute[]  Hispanic  voting  power.”  J.A.  403a-\n404a.  That  assertion  was  supported  by  the  extremely \ntight  2012  and  2014  primary  elections  in  HD90,  one  of \nwhich the Hispanic candidate of choice narrowly lost.  \n\nThe notion that a legislature may not consider race to \naddress  a  specific,  race-based  concern  about  potential \nvote  dilution  defies  common  sense.  This  Court  has  ad-\nmonished  more  times  than  bears  repeating  that  States \ncannot be caught “between the competing hazards of lia-\nbility” under the Constitution and the VRA. E.g., Bush, \n517 U.S. at 977. Allowing plaintiffs to charge a legislature \nwith  an  unlawful  purpose  for  attempting  to  address  a \nrace-based complaint is a surefire way to eliminate what \nlittle “breathing room” legislatures have left to enact dis-\ntricting  legislation  that  withstands  judicial  scrutiny. \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464.  \n\n \n \n \n \n\f73 \n\nC O N C L U S IO N \n\nThe Court should reverse the district court’s orders \ninsofar as they invalidate districts in Plan C235 and Plan \nH358. \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\nPAUL D.
