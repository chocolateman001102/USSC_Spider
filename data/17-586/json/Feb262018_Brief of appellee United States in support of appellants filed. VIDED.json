        "2 \n\nJURISDICTION \n\nIn No. 17-586, the order of the district court was en-\ntered on August 15, 2017.  Appellants filed their notice \nof appeal on August 18, 2017 (C.J.S. App. 1a-2a).  In No. \n17-626,  the  order  of  the  district  court  was  entered  on \nAugust 24, 2017.  Appellants filed their notice of appeal \non August 28, 2017 (H.J.S. App. 1a-2a).  Appellants in-\nvoke  this  Court’s  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  1253.  \nThis Court  has  postponed  further  consideration of  the \nquestion of jurisdiction pending a hearing on the merits.   \n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n\nPertinent  constitutional  and  statutory  provisions  are \nreproduced in the appendices to the jurisdictional state-\nments.  See C.J.S. App. 426a-428a; H.J.S. App. 437a-439a. \n\nSTATEMENT \n\nThese appeals concern redistricting plans enacted by \nthe Texas Legislature in 2013 for the State’s House of \nRepresentatives  (the  State  House  plan)  and  for  the \nState’s Representatives in the United States House of \nRepresentatives  (the  congressional  plan).    The  2013 \nplans were based, entirely or almost entirely, on interim \nremedial plans that a three-judge court  of the District \nCourt  for  the  Western  District  of  Texas  adopted  in \n2012,  after  that  court had enjoined use  of  the  Legisla-\nture’s  prior  2011  redistricting  plans  pending  separate \npreclearance proceedings  in  the District  Court  for  the \nDistrict of Columbia.  In the decisions under review, the \ndistrict  court  invalidated  several  districts  in  the  2013 \ncongressional  and  State  House  plans  on  the  grounds \nthat  they  were  intentionally  discriminatory,  were  ra-\ncially gerrymandered, or caused unlawful vote dilution",
        "3 \n\nin violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth  Amendment  or  the  Voting  Rights  Act  of  1965 \n(VRA), 52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq. (Supp. III 2015). 2 \n\nThe  United  States  intervened  in  the  Texas  district \ncourt to assert claims that the 2011 plans were enacted \nwith  racially  discriminatory  intent  in  violation  of  Sec-\ntion 2 of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. 10301.  The United States \nhas  not  brought  any  claims  challenging  the  2013  con-\ngressional  or  State  House  plans.    The  United  States \nnonetheless  retains  a  significant  interest  in  these  ap-\npeals because the United States, through the Attorney \nGeneral,  has  primary  responsibility  for  enforcing  the \nVRA.  See 52 U.S.C. 10308(d).  Accordingly, the United \nStates has a substantial interest in the proper interpre-\ntation of the VRA and the related constitutional protec-\ntion against the unjustified use of race in redistricting. \n1.  “[T]he  Constitution  leaves  with  the  States  pri-\nmary  responsibility  for  apportionment  of  their  federal \ncongressional and state legislative districts.”  Growe v. \nEmison, 507 U.S. 25, 34 (1993).  States have substantial \ndiscretion  to  make  the  judgments  and  compromises \nnecessary  to balance  the  complex  array  of  “competing \ninterests” involved in redistricting.  Miller v. Johnson, \n515  U.S.  900,  915  (1995).    At  the  same  time,  both  the \nConstitution and federal statutes impose constraints on \nredistricting in order to prevent racial discrimination. \na.   Section 2 of the VRA imposes a “permanent, na-\ntionwide ban on racial discrimination in voting.”  Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2631 (2013).  Section \n2 prohibits  any  “voting  qualification  or prerequisite to \nvoting or standard, practice, or procedure” that “results \nin a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of \n\n2  All references to Sections of the VRA are found in the 2015 Sup-\n\nplement of the United States Code.",
        "4 \n\nthe United States to vote on account of race or color.”  \n52 U.S.C. 10301(a).  As amended in 1982, Section 2 pro-\nvides  that  a  violation  may  be  “established  if,  based  on \nthe totality of circumstances, it is shown that the [elec-\ntion]  processes   * * *  in  the State  or political  subdivi-\nsion are not equally open to participation by members \nof a [protected] class [who] have less opportunity than \nother members of the electorate to participate in the po-\nlitical  process  and  to  elect  representatives  of  their \nchoice.”  52 U.S.C. 10301(b).   \n\nBoth Section 2 of the VRA and the Equal Protection \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibit  inten-\ntional  “vote  dilution.”    Rogers  v.  Lodge,  458  U.S.  613, \n617,  621  (1982)  (Fourteenth  Amendment);  Garza  v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 766 (9th Cir. 1990) \n(Section  2),  cert. denied,  498  U.S.  1028 (1991);  S. Rep. \nNo. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 27 & n.108 (1982) (Senate \nReport) (same).  Vote dilution is caused “either ‘by the \ndispersal  of  [minority  voters]  into  districts  in  which \nthey constitute an ineffective minority of voters or from \nthe  concentration  of  [minority  voters]  into  districts \nwhere  they  constitute  an  excessive  majority.’ ”    Voino-\nvich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 154 (1993) (quoting Thorn-\nburgh v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 (1986)).   \n\nIn  addition,  vote  dilution  without  a  finding  of  dis-\ncriminatory intent may violate Section 2 under its “re-\nsults” test.  This Court has identified three “precondi-\ntions” for a vote-dilution claim under that test:  (1) The \nminority  group  must  be  “sufficiently  large  and  geo-\ngraphically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember  district,” (2) the  minority group  must be “po-\nlitically cohesive,” and (3) the majority must “vote[] suf-\nficiently as a bloc” to usually “defeat the minority’s pre-\nferred  candidate.”    Gingles,  478  U.S.  at  50-51;  see",
        "5 \n\nCooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455,  1470  (2017).    For  \nsingle-member districting schemes,  the  first precondi-\ntion  also  requires  showing  a  “possibility  of  creating \nmore  than  the existing  number  of reasonably  compact \ndistricts with a sufficiently large minority population to \nelect candidates of its choice.”  Johnson v. De Grandy, \n512 U.S. 997, 1008 (1994).  If a party establishes those \npreconditions, a court then must “consider the ‘totality \nof  circumstances’  to  determine  whether  members  of  a \nracial group have less opportunity than do other mem-\nbers of the electorate.”  League of United Latin Am. Cit-\nizens  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  425-426  (2006)  (LULAC) \n(quoting De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1011-1012); see Senate \nReport  27-29  (articulating  factors  to  consider).    The \nCourt has reserved the question of how “intentional dis-\ncrimination affects the Gingles analysis” for a Section 2 \nclaim.  Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 20 (2009) (plu-\nrality opinion).   \n\nb.  The Equal Protection Clause, in addition to pro-\nhibiting  intentional  vote  dilution,  forbids  the  unjusti-\nfied,  predominant  use  of  race  in  drawing  districts, \nknown  as  “unconstitutional  racial  gerrymandering.”  \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (Shaw I).  Such \na  claim  is  “ ‘analytically  distinct’  from  a  vote  dilution \nclaim.”    Miller,  515  U.S.  at  911  (citation  omitted).    In \nadjudicating  a  racial-gerrymandering  claim,  the  court \nmust determine whether race was “the predominant fac-\ntor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a signif-\nicant  number  of  voters  within  or  without  a  particular  \ndistrict”—i.e.,  whether  race  is  the  “dominant  and  con-\ntrolling rationale” for a district’s lines.  Id. at 913, 916.  If \nso, that use of race comports with the Equal Protection \nClause only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compel-\nling  state  interest.    Id.  at  920;  see  Hunt  v.  Cromartie,",
        "6 \n\n526 U.S. 541, 547 (1999) (“[S]trict scrutiny applies if race \nwas ‘the predominant factor’ motivating the legislature’s \ndistricting decision.”). \n\nThis  Court  has  “long  assumed”  that  States  have  a \ncompelling  interest  in  complying  with  Section  2  of  the \nVRA.    Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1469;  see,  e.g.,  Abrams  v. \nJohnson, 521 U.S. 74, 91 (1997); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. \n899,  915 (1996)  (Shaw  II); Bush  v. Vera,  517  U.S.  952, \n978  (1996)  (plurality  opinion);  Bush,  517  U.S.  at  990 \n(O’Connor,  J.,  concurring).3    The  predominant  use  of \nrace  in  an  effort  to  comply  with  the  VRA  will  survive \nstrict scrutiny so long as a State has “a ‘strong basis in \nevidence’ in support of the (race-based) choice that it has \nmade.”  Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, \n135 S. Ct. 1257, 1274 (2015) (citation omitted).  A “strong \nbasis in evidence” exists so long as legislators “have good \nreasons to believe such use [of race] is required, even if \na court does not find that the actions were necessary for \nstatutory  compliance.”    Ibid.  (citation  omitted).    That \nstandard affords States “ ‘breathing room’ to adopt rea-\nsonable compliance measures that may prove, in perfect \nhindsight, not to have been needed.”  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. \nat 1464 (quoting Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of \nElections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 802 (2017)). \n\n2.  This  litigation  arises  from  redistricting  under-\ntaken by Texas following the 2010 Census.  The Census \nshowed  that  Texas  had  gained  more  than  four  million \n\n3  This Court also has repeatedly assumed that States have a com-\npelling interest in complying with Section 5 of the VRA.  See, e.g., \nBethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 801 \n(2017) (rejecting racial-gerrymandering claim where the “State had \nsufficient grounds to determine that the race-based calculus it em-\nployed  * * *  was necessary to avoid violating § 5”).",

In  June  2011,  the  Texas  Legislature enacted  re-\ndistricting plans for, as relevant here, the State House \n(Plan H283) and the U.S. congressional delegation (Plan \nC185).4  At that time, Section 5 of the VRA required the \nState to obtain preclearance before implementing those \nplans, a process that required it to show that the plans \n“neither ha[d] the purpose nor w[ould] have the effect” \nof discriminating on the basis of race.  52 U.S.C. 10304(a).  \nTexas sought preclearance for its 2011 plans by filing a \ndeclaratory-judgment  action  in  the  District  Court  for \nthe District of Columbia in July 2011. \n  Meanwhile, in June and July 2011, various plaintiffs \nbrought Section 2 and constitutional claims against the \n2011 congressional and State House plans, which were \nconsolidated  before a  three-judge  district  court  in  the \nWestern District of Texas.  That court enjoined use of \nthe  2011  plans  and—lacking  any  final decision  on pre-\nclearance from the D.C. district court—adopted interim \nredistricting plans to govern the 2012 elections.  In do-\ning  so,  the  district  court  believed  that  it  “was  not  re-\nquired  to  give  any  deference  to  the  Legislature’s  en-\nacted plan[s].”  Perry, 565 U.S. at 396 (citation and in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \n\n4  The Legislature also enacted a redistricting plan for the State \nSenate, which led to separate litigation before the same three-judge \ncourt.    See  Davis  v.  Perry,  No.  11-788  (W.D. Tex.  Sept.  22,  2011).  \nFollowing adoption of a revised plan in 2013, the State Senate liti-\ngation was dismissed as  moot.  See Davis v. Abbott, 781 F.3d 207, \n209 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 534 (2015).  The State Senate \nplan is not at issue in these appeals.",
        "8 \n\nThis  Court  vacated  the  interim plans  and remanded \nfor  further  proceedings.    Perry,  565  U.S.  at  399.    The \nCourt  agreed  that,  absent  preclearance  of  the  State’s \n2011 plans, it was necessary for the district court to de-\nvise interim plans for the 2012 elections.  Id. at 392.  The \nCourt  concluded,  however,  that  the  district  court  had \nerred “[t]o the extent [it]  * * *  substituted its own con-\ncept  of  the  ‘collective  public  good’ ”  in  formulating  in-\nterim relief.  Id. at 396.  The Court concluded that “[the] \ndistrict court should take guidance from the State’s re-\ncently enacted plan,” to the extent the legislative poli-\ncies reflected in that plan “ ‘do not lead to violations of \nthe Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.’ ”  Id. at 393 \n(citation omitted). \n\nThis  Court  then  articulated  legal  standards  for  de-\nvising  interim  plans  on  remand.    When  portions  of  a \nState’s enacted plan are alleged to violate the Constitu-\ntion or Section 2 of the VRA, “a district court should still \nbe guided by that plan, except to the extent those legal \nchallenges are shown to have a likelihood of success on \nthe merits.”  Perry, 565 U.S. at 394.  When portions of \nthe  State’s enacted  plan are  the subject  of a  Section  5 \npreclearance  proceeding  elsewhere  that  has  not  yet \nbeen  completed,  the  district  court  must  “tak[e]  guid-\nance from a State’s policy judgments unless they reflect \naspects of the state plan that stand a reasonable proba-\nbility of failing to gain § 5 preclearance.”  Id. at 395.  The \nCourt reiterated that the district court “must, of course, \ntake  care  not  to  incorporate  into  the  interim  plan  any \nlegal defects in the state plan.”  Id. at 394.  \n\nb.  On remand, in February 2012, the Texas district \ncourt  ordered  the  use  of  revised  interim  plans  for  the \n2012 elections (Plans C235 and H309).  C.J.S. App. 367a-\n424a;  H.J.S.  App.  300a-315a.    Both  were  compromise",
        "9 \n\nplans  accepted  by  the  State  and  certain  plaintiffs.  \nC.J.S. App. 6a, 368a, 394a-395a. \n\nWith respect to congressional districting, Plan C235 \nmade significant changes to nine districts as compared to \nthe Legislature’s 2011 plan.  But it made no changes to \nthe  two  congressional  districts  now  at  issue:    CD27,  a  \nmajority-Anglo district covering Nueces County (which \nincludes  Corpus  Christi)  and  points  northward;  and \nCD35, a majority-Latino district extending from Travis \nCounty (Austin) to Bexar County (San Antonio).  C.J.S. \nApp. 408a, 419a.   \n\nBefore  2011,  CD27  had been  a  majority-Latino  dis-\ntrict that included Nueces County.  The 2011 version of \nCD27  still  included  the  concentration  of  Latino  voters \nin Nueces County, but placed them in a majority-Anglo \ndistrict.  C.J.S. App. 417a.  Various plaintiffs raised Sec-\ntion 2 claims and Section 5 arguments against the new \nCD27 (id. at 388a, 417a-423a), but the district court con-\ncluded  that  those  challenges  were  unlikely  to  succeed \nunder  the  standards  articulated  in  Perry.    The  court \nfound  that,  regardless  of  how  CD27  was  configured, \n“only 7 reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts \nc[ould] be drawn in compliance with § 2” in the “South \nand West Texas area.”  Id. at 418a, 421a.  And the court \nexplained  that  Plan  C235  would  restore  a  different  \ndistrict—CD23—as  a  Latino  opportunity  district, \nthereby ensuring that the plan had seven such districts.  \nThe court thus concluded that Plan C235 “substantially \naddresses the §  2  violation,”  and retention of  the  2011 \nversion of CD27 was appropriate in order to “respect[] \nthe Legislature’s policy decisions concerning the place-\nment of Nueces County.” Id. at 421a.  The court also did \nnot identify any retrogression concerns with CD27 un-\nder Section 5.  Cf. id. at 399a, 422a-423a.",
        "10 \n\n  As to CD35, one group of private plaintiffs urged the \ndistrict court to find it a proper Section 2 Latino oppor-\ntunity district, while others urged the court to reject it as \nan unconstitutional racial gerrymander or as intentionally \nvote  dilutive.    The  court  concluded  that  the  racial- \ngerrymandering claim was a “close call,” C.J.S. App. 409a, \nbut found that the challenge was likely without merit, both \nbecause  of  inadequate  evidence  that  race  had  predomi-\nnated in the creation of CD35 and because there was no \nsubstantial  likelihood  that  CD35  would  fail  strict  scru-\ntiny in any event.  Id. at 415a.  The court also found that \nplaintiffs had not shown that CD35 was created for the \ndiscriminatory purpose of “dismantling” a prior “crosso-\nver” district (CD25) rather than because of “partisan pol-\nitics.”  Ibid.5 \n    With respect to the State House, in ordering the use \nof  Plan  H309,  the  district  court  made  “substantial[]” \nchanges  to  21  districts.    H.J.S.  App.  314a.    But  Plan \nH309  retained  122  State  House  districts  without \nchange, including most of those now before this Court:  \nHD54  and  HD55  in  Bell  County;  HD32  and  HD34  in \nNueces County; and HD103, HD104, and HD105 in Dal-\nlas County.  Id. at 303a n.4.  The court explained that by \nkeeping  those  districts  unchanged,  it  was  “[f ]ollowing \n[this] Court’s direction to leave undisturbed any district \nthat is free from legal defect.”  Id. at 303a. \n\n5  A “crossover” district is “one in which minority voters make up \nless than a majority of the voting-age population,” but in which the \n“minority  population,  at  least  potentially,  is  large  enough  to  elect \nthe candidate of its choice with help from voters who are members \nof  the  majority  and  who  cross  over  to  support  the  minority’s  pre-\nferred  candidate.”    Bartlett,  556  U.S.  at  13  (plurality  opinion).    A \n“coalition” district is one in which “two minority groups form a coa-\nlition to elect the candidate of the coalition’s choice.”  Ibid.",
        "11 \n\nAlthough  the  district  court  found  that  Plans  C235 \nand  H309  satisfied  this  Court’s  standards  in  Perry,  it \nnoted that its decisions were preliminary and not final \nrulings on the merits of any claim concerning the 2011 \nplans.  C.J.S.  App.  367a;  H.J.S.  App.  315a.    The  2012 \nelections were conducted under Plans C235 and H309.  \nc.  In August 2012, the D.C. district court denied pre-\nclearance to Texas’s 2011 congressional and State House \nredistricting plans.  See Texas v. United States, 887 F. \nSupp. 2d 133 (three-judge court), vacated and remanded, \n133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013).  As to the congressional plan, the \ncourt concluded that Texas had failed to meet its burden \nunder Section 5 of the VRA to prove an absence of dis-\ncriminatory intent.  Id. at 159-166.  As to the State House \nplan, the court concluded that Texas had failed to meet \nits  burden  under  Section  5  to  establish  the  absence  of \nretrogressive effect, and also stated that the record sug-\ngested that that effect “may not have been accidental.”  \nId. at 178; see id. at 166-178.  The State appealed the de-\nnial of preclearance to this Court.  \n\nd.  In  March  2013—while  Texas’s  preclearance  ap-\npeal  was  pending,  and  while  the  litigation  below  was \nheld  in  abeyance—the  Texas  Attorney  General  pro-\nposed to the Legislature that it enact the district court’s \n2012 interim maps as the State’s permanent redistrict-\ning plans.  C.J.S. App. 429a-435a.  He observed that the \n2011 plans had been found by the D.C. district court to \nbe “tainted by evidence of discriminatory purpose,” and \nexplained  that  “the  best  way  to  remedy  the  violations  \n* * *  is  to  adopt  the  court-drawn interim plans  as  the \nState’s permanent redistricting maps.”  Id. at 432a.  In \nMay  2013,  the  Texas  Governor  called  the  Legislature \ninto  special  session  to  consider  that  proposal.    C.J.S. \nSupp. App. 231a.",
        "12 \n\nOn June 23, 2013, the Texas Legislature passed bills \nadopting  new  redistricting  plans.    The  Texas  Legisla-\nture adopted without alteration the court-ordered con-\ngressional  interim  map  (Plan  C235)  as  its  permanent \ncongressional  plan.    C.J.S.  App.  9a.    The  Legislature \nmade minor changes to the court-ordered State House \ninterim  map  and  then  enacted  that  map  as  its  perma-\nnent  State  House  plan  (Plan  H358).    Ibid.    The  2013 \nplans were signed into law on June 26, 2013, and became \neffective in September 2013.  C.J.S. Supp. App. 232a. \n\ne.  On June 25, 2013, this Court issued its decision in \nShelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013),  holding \nthat  the  coverage  formula  in  Section  4(b)  of  the  VRA \nwas unconstitutional and could “no longer be used as a \nbasis  for  subjecting  jurisdictions  to  preclearance”  un-\nder Section 5.  Id. at 2631.  This Court then vacated the \nD.C.  district  court’s  judgment  denying  preclearance, \n133 S. Ct.  2885,  and  on  remand,  that  court  granted \nTexas’s motion for voluntary dismissal.   \n\n3.  a.  Litigation in the Texas district court resumed.  \nThe court allowed plaintiffs to amend their complaints \nto challenge the newly enacted 2013 plans and, with re-\nspect to existing claims against the 2011 plans, to seek \nrelief under Section 3(c) of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. 10302(c).  \nD. Ct. Doc. 886, at 8-19 (Sept. 6, 2013). 6  The court or-\ndered,  however,  that  the  Legislature’s  newly  enacted \n2013 plans (Plans C235 and H358) would be used for the \n2014 elections.  Id. at 21-26.  The court noted that it had \n\n6  Section 3(c), known as the VRA’s “bail-in” provision, permits a \ndistrict court, upon a finding that “violations of the [F]ourteenth or \n[F]ifteenth  [A]mendment  justifying  equitable  relief  have occurred \nwithin the territory of [a] State or political subdivision,” to require \nthe defendant to seek approval of future voting changes through a \nregime similar to Section 5 preclearance.  52 U.S.C. 10302(c).",
        "13 \n\n“already” conducted “a preliminary injunction analysis” \non  plaintiffs’  challenges  in  its  decisions  adopting  the \n2012 interim plans, id. at 22, and it found that the sole \n“new legal challenge” brought by plaintiffs (concerning \nHD90,  which  had  been  modified  by  the  2013  Legisla-\nture) was not likely to succeed, id. at 23-24.  The court \nacknowledged  it  still  needed  to  “reach  a  final  decision \non  the  merits  of  all  claims,”  but  concluded  that  it  was \n“impossible  to  reach  that  decision  prior  to  the  various \ndeadlines for the 2014 elections.”  Id. at 22. \n\nThe United States intervened in the litigation.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 904 (Sept. 24, 2013).  In its complaint, the United \nStates did not challenge the 2013 plans, but instead ar-\ngued  that  the  2011  plans  (Plans  C185  and  H283)  had \nbeen adopted with racially discriminatory intent in vio-\nlation of Section 2 and that Section 3(c) relief was war-\nranted.    D. Ct.  Doc.  907,  at  14  (Sept.  25,  2013).    The \nUnited States’ complaint asserted only intentional vote-\ndilution claims, and did not raise any Section 2 results \nclaims. \n  b.  In July and August 2014, the Texas district court \nconducted  bench  trials  on  the  claims  against  the  2011 \ncongressional and State House plans.  C.J.S. App. 13a.   \nIn October 2015, while a decision on the 2011 plans \nwas still pending, plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunc-\ntion barring the use of the 2013 plans for the 2016 elec-\ntions.  The court denied that request, explaining that the \n2013 plans were “the product of the [c]ourt’s preliminary \ninjunction analysis” in 2012, and concluding that “scruti-\nnizing the same plan[s] under the same preliminary in-\njunction  analysis  would  [not]  produce  a  different  out-\ncome today.”  D. Ct. Doc. 1324, at 5-6 (Nov. 6, 2015).  The \n2013 plans were therefore used for the 2016 elections.",
        "14 \n\nc.  Two-and-a-half years after trial, in various orders \nissued  in  March  through  May  2017,  the  district  court \nheld by a 2-1 vote that Texas had violated the VRA, the \nConstitution, or both in drawing various districts in the \n2011  plans.    C.J.S.  App.  120a-366a;  H.J.S.  App.  88a-\n299a; see C.J.S. Supp. App. 1a-490a (separate findings \nof fact); H.J.S. Supp. App. 1a-309a (same). \n  As  relevant  here,  with  respect  to  the  2011  congres-\nsional plan, the district-court majority found that CD27 \nand  CD35  were  unlawful  (notwithstanding  the  district \ncourt’s prior provisional determinations to the contrary).  \nC.J.S. App. 161a-195a, 330a.  As to CD27, the court con-\ncluded that the placement of Hispanic voters in Nueces \nCounty  into  a  majority-Anglo  district  “had  the  effect \nand  was  intended  to  dilute  their  opportunity  to  elect \ntheir candidate of choice.”  Id. at 330a.  The court stated \nthat,  although  only  “seven  compact  Latino  opportunity \ndistricts could be drawn in South/West Texas,” “Nueces \nCounty Hispanics could be included in one of those dis-\ntricts  for  § 2  purposes.”    Id.  at  181a.    As  to  CD35,  the \ncourt concluded that the district was an unconstitutional \nracial gerrymander, finding that race had predominated \nin its construction and that the district could not survive \nstrict scrutiny.  Id. at 175a.  Judge Smith dissented, both \non the ground that the challenges to the 2011 plans were \nmoot and on the merits.  Id. at 331a-366a. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  2011  State  House  plan,  the  \ndistrict-court majority found that plaintiffs had proven \nintentional vote dilution on a statewide basis and also in \ncertain  regions.    H.J.S.  App.  192a,  275a.    The  specific \ndistricts invalidated because of discriminatory intent in-\ncluded those in Nueces County (HD32 and HD34), Bell \nCounty (HD54 and HD55), and Dallas County (HD103, \nHD104, and HD105).  Id. at 126a-137a, 164a-173a, 178a-",
        "15 \n\n183a, 275a.  Judge Smith again dissented on both moot-\nness and the merits.  Id. at 277a-299a.  \n\nAfter  issuing  those  decisions  on  the  2011  plans,  the \ndistrict court held a trial on the 2013 plans in July 2017.  \nBecause the United States asserted no claims against the \n2013 plans, it did not participate in the trial.   \n\nd.  In  decisions  issued  in  August  2017,  the  district \ncourt  invalidated  several  districts  in  the  State’s  2013 \ncongressional and State House plans.  See C.J.S. App. \n3a-119a; H.J.S. App. 3a-87a.  \n\nAs  relevant  here,  the  district  court  held  that  every \ndistrict it  had  found  to  be intentionally discriminatory \nor  racially  gerrymandered  in  the  2011  plans  was  also \nnecessarily unlawful in the 2013 plans “where th[e] dis-\ntrict lines remain[ed] unchanged.”  C.J.S. App. 46a; see \nid. at 35a; H.J.S. App. 6a.  The court acknowledged that \nthe  2013  Legislature  had  effectively  “adopted  the \n[c]ourt’s [interim] plans” from 2012, but reasoned that \nthat action “d[id] not change” the analysis because the \nLegislature “did not engage in a deliberative process to \nensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 \nplans.”  C.J.S. App. 40a.  Based on that conclusion, the \ncourt  suggested  that  the  Legislature  had  enacted  the \n2013 plans “as part of a litigation strategy” designed to \n“insulate”  the  State’s  actions  from  further  challenge, \nrather  than  as  an  attempt  to  “adopt  legally  compliant \nplans  free  from  discriminatory  taint.”    Id.  at  40a-41a.  \nThus,  as  to  the  2013  congressional  plan,  the  district \ncourt invalidated CD27 and CD35, see id. at 117a-118a, \nand  as  to  the  2013  State  House  plan,  the  court  invali-\ndated  HD32  and  HD34  (Nueces  County),  HD54  and",
        "16 \n\nHD55  (Bell  County),  and  HD103,  HD104,  and  HD105 \n(Dallas County), see H.J.S. App. 84a-85a.7 \n\nConcluding  that  these  violations  “must  be  reme-\ndied,” C.J.S. App. 117a; see H.J.S. App. 84a-85a, the dis-\ntrict court directed the Texas Attorney General to ad-\nvise the court “within three business days” whether the \nTexas Legislature would “take up redistricting in an ef-\nfort to cure these violations.”  C.J.S. App. 118a; H.J.S. \nApp. 86a.  The court further ordered that, absent such \nlegislative  redistricting,  it  would  hold  “hearing[s]  to \nconsider remedial plans” in early September 2017.  Ibid.   \nTexas  sought  emergency  relief  from  this  Court, \nwhich stayed the district court’s orders invalidating the \n2013 redistricting plans.  Order, No. 17A225 (Sept. 12, \n2017); Order, No. 17A245 (Sept. 12, 2017).  Upon consid-\neration of Texas’s jurisdictional statements, this Court \nordered briefing and postponed further consideration of \nthe question of jurisdiction pending hearing of the case \non the merits.  Order, No. 17-586 (Jan. 12, 2018); Order, \nNo. 17-626 (Jan. 12, 2018).   \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nI.  This Court possesses jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1253, which allows direct appeals to this Court from an \n\n7  The district court also invalidated HD90—a district newly drawn \nin  the  2013  State  House  plan—as  a  racial  gerrymander,  and  held \nthat HD32 and HD34 were unlawful for the additional reason that \nthey  violated  the  Section  2  results  test.    See  H.J.S.  App.  85a.    In \naddition, the court held that CD27 violated the Section 2 results test.  \nC.J.S. App. 112a; see also id. at 180a-195a.  The United States takes \nno position on those rulings.  The United States did not assert any \nresults claims in this litigation, and HD90 was revised in 2013 and \nthus does not involve the legislative adoption of a district provision-\nally  approved  by  the  district  court—the  principal  issue  addressed \nby the United States in this brief.",
        "17 \n\norder  granting  or  denying  an  interlocutory  or  perma-\nnent injunction in three-judge district-court actions un-\nder  28 U.S.C.  2284(a) challenging  the  constitutionality \nof congressional districts or statewide legislative appor-\ntionments.  This Court has made clear in the analogous \ncontext  of  28  U.S.C.  1292(a)(1)  that  even  an  order  not \nstyled as the grant or denial of an injunction is appeal-\nable if it has the “practical effect” of granting or deny-\ning an injunction, “might have a ‘serious, perhaps irrep-\narable,  consequence,’ ”  and  “can  be  ‘effectually  chal-\nlenged’  only  by  immediate  appeal.”   Carson  v.  Ameri-\ncan Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981).  Under the un-\nusual facts of this case, the district court’s orders meet \nthose standards.  The orders had the effect of prohibit-\ning  further  use  of  the  State’s  2013  congressional  and \nState House plans; they had the serious consequence of \nrequiring statewide redistricting on the eve of prepara-\ntions for the 2018 election cycle; and, under the timing \nexigencies present here, the orders could only be effec-\ntually challenged by immediate appeal. \n\nII.  The  district  court  committed  errors  of  law  in \nfinding  that  the  Texas  Legislature  engaged  in  inten-\ntional vote dilution in adopting Congressional District 27 \nand State House Districts 32, 34, 54, 55, 103, 104, and 105 \nin the 2013 plans, all of which were identical to districts \ncontained in the court’s own 2012 interim plans.   \n\nA. The  principles  for  adjudicating  claims  of  inten-\ntional  vote  dilution  are  well  established.    A  legislative \nenactment may be invalidated on that basis only if the \nplaintiffs show that the legislature acted with a discrim-\ninatory  purpose.    In  the  redistricting  context,  as  else-\nwhere, courts must accord a “presumption of good faith \n[to]  legislative  enactments.”    Hunt  v.  Cromartie,  526 \nU.S. 541, 553 (1999) (citation omitted).  Courts must not",
        "18 \n\ninfer discriminatory racial intent solely from disparate \nracial effects, and a finding of past intentional discrimi-\nnation  standing  alone  generally  cannot  support  an  in-\nference  of  intentional  discrimination  in  a  new  enact-\nment.  And when, as here, a State adopts legislatively a \nnew redistricting plan after a prior plan is held unlaw-\nful, the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff in any chal-\nlenge to the new plan.   \n\nThese principles also suggest a further principle:  A \ncourt should afford particular weight to a state legisla-\nture’s  reliance  on  a  court-ordered  remedy.    When  a \ncourt has found in a reasoned decision that an interim \nplan redresses all likely violations of law, and when the \nstate  legislature  permanently  adopts  that  plan  to  re-\nplace its original enactment, the normal presumption of \ngood faith accorded to legislative enactments is height-\nened by the State’s acceptance of the judicial plan.  Ap-\nplying a strong presumption of good faith in this context \nwould  not  direct  an  answer  to  the  intent  inquiry  as  a \nmatter of law, but plaintiffs should bear a heavy burden \nin  establishing  that  a  state  legislature’s  adoption  of  a \ncourt-ordered plan was intentionally discriminatory.   \nB. The  district  court  erred  in  its  analysis  of  inten-\ntional vote dilution.  Instead of asking whether plaintiffs \nhad proven that the 2013 Legislature adopted the 2013 \nplans with the purpose of harming minority voters, the \ncourt  asked  whether  the  State  had  shown  that  it  re-\nmoved  the  “taint  of  discriminatory  intent”  that  in  the \ncourt’s  view  had  “carr[ied]  over”  from  the  2011  plans.  \nC.J.S.  App.  38a,  46a.    But  the  lawfulness  of  the  2013 \nplans turns on the motivations of the 2013 Legislature, \nand plaintiffs—not the State—bore the burden of proof \nin that analysis.",
        "19 \n\nC. The circumstances here confirm the soundness of \napplying a strong presumption of good faith.  The 2013 \nLegislature’s plans  were identical,  or nearly  so,  to  the \ncourt-ordered interim plans.  In adopting those interim \nplans  after extensive evidentiary proceedings,  the  dis-\ntrict  court expressly considered under  Perry  v.  Perez, \n565 U.S. 388 (2012) (per curiam), and provisionally re-\njected, claims of intentional discrimination involving the \nsame districts now at issue.  And the court made numer-\nous other ameliorative changes, which gave the Legis-\nlature  good  reason  to  believe  that  the  interim  plans \nwould suffice to remedy any prior deficiencies.   \n\nThe district court’s orders and plaintiffs’ jurisdictional-\nstage  filings  in  this  Court  do  not  point  to  evidence  that \nwould  rebut  the  strong  presumption  of  good  faith.    The \ncourt perceived that Texas was motivated to pursue a leg-\nislative solution as a “strategy” to end the pending liti-\ngation.    But  such  efforts  at  voluntary  compliance  pre-\nsumptively  further—not frustrate—Congress’s  goal  of \nameliorating  unlawful  discrimination.    And  the  court \nidentified no evidence showing that Texas acted with an \nintent to discriminate rather than an intent to adopt le-\ngally compliant plans.  \n\nIII. The district court also erred in finding Congres-\nsional District 35 to be an unconstitutional racial gerry-\nmander.    The  “predominant”  consideration  in  setting \nthe boundaries of CD35 in 2013 was not race, but rather \nwhether  they  matched  the  boundaries  provisionally \ndeemed  lawful  in  2012.    And  the  State  had  “good  rea-\nsons” to believe that the Voting Rights Act required it \nto draw CD35 in 2011 and maintain it in 2013, including \nthat  the  district  court  had  found  in  2012  that  CD35 \naided  in  complying  with  the  State’s  obligations  under",
        "20 \n\nthe VRA to draw seven Latino opportunity districts in \nSouth and West Texas. \n\nARGUMENT  \n\nI.  THIS  COURT  MAY  EXERCISE  JURISDICTION  OVER \n\nTHESE APPEALS \nA party may appeal directly to this Court “from an \norder  granting  or  denying    * * *    an  interlocutory  or \npermanent  injunction”  in  a  civil  action  required  to  be \nadjudicated by  a  three-judge district  court.    28  U.S.C. \n1253.    Under  28  U.S.C.  2284(a),  a  three-judge  district \ncourt is required for actions “challenging the constitu-\ntionality of the apportionment of congressional districts \nor the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.”  \nOrdinarily, when a district court has not entered an or-\nder granting or denying an injunction, this Court lacks \njurisdiction  to  enter  a  direct  appeal.    The  Court  has \nmade  clear  in  the  analogous  context  of  28  U.S.C. \n1292(a)(1), however, that even an order not styled as the \ngrant or denial of an injunction is appealable if it (1) has \nthe “practical effect” of granting or denying an injunc-\ntion;  (2)  “might  have  a  ‘serious,  perhaps  irreparable, \nconsequence’ ”;  and  (3) “can  be  ‘effectually  challenged’ \nonly  by  immediate  appeal.”    Carson  v.  American \nBrands,  Inc.,  450  U.S.  79,  84  (1981);  see  Gulfstream \nAerospace  Corp.  v.  Mayacamas  Corp.,  485  U.S.  271, \n287-288  (1988).    In  the  circumstances  presented  here, \nthe district court’s August 15 and 24 orders meet those \nstandards. \n\nA. This case presents an unusual combination of ex-\ntraordinary delays in the judicial proceedings followed \nby  the  equally  extraordinary  expedition  of  those  pro-\nceedings  on  the  eve  of  preparations  for  the  upcoming \nelection  cycle.    After  Texas  enacted  the  2013 congres-\nsional  and  State  House  plans,  plaintiffs  promptly",
        "21 \n\namended  their  complaints  to  challenge  them.    But  the \ntrial on the 2013 plans was not held until July 2017, and \nthe  district  court  did  not  issue  its  decisions  on  those \nplans  until  mid-August  2017,  even  though  Texas  had \npreviously informed the district court that its deadlines \nto  begin  preparations  for  the  2018  election  cycle  re-\nquired that its plans be in place no later than October 1, \n2017.    See  D. Ct.  Doc.  1388,  at  1-2  (May  1, 2017).8    By \nthe time the district court finally ruled, the 2013 plans \n(or  the  2012  court-ordered  plans  on  which  they  were \nbased) had been used for three straight election cycles \n(2012, 2014, and 2016).   \n\nThe district court’s August 15 and August 24 orders \nheld that the 2013 plans were unlawful and made clear \nthat  those  plans  would  not  be  used  for  the  upcoming \n2018 elections.  The court’s orders found that the 2013 \ncongressional and State House plans contained various \n“statutory and constitutional violations” and stated that \nthose violations “must be remedied by either the Texas \nLegislature  or  this  Court.”    C.J.S.  App.  118a;  H.J.S. \nApp.  84a-85a  (similar).    The  court  then  directed  the \nTexas  Attorney  General  to  advise,  within  only  “three \nbusiness  days,”  whether  “the  Legislature  intends  to \n\n8  Texas advised the district court that pursuant to Texas Election \nCode § 14.001 (West 2017), election officials were required to mail \nvoter election certificates on or after November 15, 2017, but before \nDecember 6, 2017.  See D. Ct. Doc. 1388, at 2.  The State indicated \nthat  October  1,  2017  was  “the  last  possible  date  when  individual \nvoter-registration-templates must be provided by the Secretary of \nState  to  each  of  the  254  county  election  officials  in  the  State  of \nTexas.”  Id. at 1-2.  The State’s primary elections are scheduled for \nMarch 6, 2018.",
        "22 \n\ntake  up  redistricting  in  an  effort  to  cure  these  viola-\ntions.”    C.J.S.  App.  118a; H.J.S.  App.  86a.9    The  court \nfurther  directed  that  “[i]f  the  Legislature  does  not  in-\ntend  to  take  up  redistricting,”  the  court  would  hold \n“hearing[s] to consider remedial plans” on September 5 \nand 6, 2017.  Ibid.  The court ordered that, in that event, \n“the parties must take immediate steps to consult with \ntheir  experts  and  mapdrawers  and  prepare  statewide  \n* * *  plans that remedy the violations.”  Ibid. \n\nIn  these  circumstances,  the  district  court’s  orders \nwere tantamount to injunctive relief.  The court’s signif-\nicant delay,  coupled  with  the impending  deadlines  and \nthe  remarkably  compressed  time  frame  to  consider  a \npossible  legislative  enactment,  placed  Texas  in  a  diffi-\ncult position:  because the district court found the exist-\ning  plans  “unlawful”  and  ordered  that  they  “must  be \nremedied,” Texas could be quite confident that the dis-\ntrict court would not permit it to use those plans for the \n2018  elections,  even  though  the  court  had  approved \ntheir use in prior years.  Yet that consequence was not \nexpressly  stated  in  the  form  of  an  injunction.    Had \nTexas been required to wait until the district court en-\ntered  an  express  injunction,  it  would  likely  have  come \ntoo late to afford Texas a reasonable opportunity under \n\n9  That three-day response period was far shorter than is typically \nafforded  to  a  state  legislature,  which  this  Court has  stated  should \nbe given a “reasonable opportunity” to contemplate a possible leg-\nislative remedy before being compelled to proceed to remedial liti-\ngation.  Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U.S. 567, 576 (1997) \n(quoting Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978) (principal opin-\nion)).",
        "23 \n\nthe circumstances for appellate review before deadlines \nassociated with the 2018 election cycle.10 \n\nB. None of this Court’s decisions compels a different \nresult.    In  Gunn  v.  University  Committee  to  End  the \nWar in Viet Nam, 399 U.S. 383 (1970), this Court held \nthat  it  lacked  jurisdiction  under  Section  1253  over  a \nthree-judge  district-court  order  that  declared  a  state \nlaw  unconstitutional, but  declined  to  enter an  immedi-\nate  injunction.    That  case,  however,    did  not  involve  a \nredistricting suit under 28 U.S.C. 2284(a) or the timing \nconsiderations present here, and it cannot be said that \nthe  district  court’s  liability  determination  in  that  case \ncould  only  be  effectually  challenged  by  immediate  ap-\npeal.    Similarly,  in  Whitcomb  v.  Chavis,  403  U.S.  124 \n(1971), this Court held in a footnote that it lacked juris-\ndiction under Section 1253 to entertain an appeal from \nan  interlocutory  liability determination in  a redistrict-\ning  case.   Id.  at  138  n.19;  see  Whitcomb  v.  Davis,  403 \nU.S.  914  (1971)  (order  dismissing  appeal).    But  that \ncase, too, did not involve the timing pressures present \nhere, and the Court did not expressly consider whether \nthe  district  court’s  liability  ruling  may  have  had  the \npractical effect of an injunction.  \n\n10  We do not suggest that such preliminary deadlines in the elec-\ntion cycle should stand as an obstacle to relief on the merits if the \nCourt were to find a violation of the VRA or the Constitution and if \nthe  considerations  identified  in  Purcell  v.  Gonzalez,  549  U.S.  1 \n(2006)  (per  curiam),  for  withholding  relief  close  to  an  election  are \nnot yet present.  As explained in the text, however, the delays and \nresulting compressed time frame are relevant for purposes of con-\nstruing 28 U.S.C. 1253 and 2284(a), which provide for direct review \nof  injunctions  against  statewide  reapportionment  plans  to  ensure \nprompt resolution of challenges to such plans and to accord respect \nfor acts of a state legislature.",
        "24 \n\nII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  ITS  ANALYSIS  OF \nINTENTIONAL  VOTE  DILUTION  IN  THE  2013  CON-\nGRESSIONAL AND STATE HOUSE PLANS  \nOn the merits, the Court should correct the legal er-\nrors  underlying  the  district  court’s  rulings  that  the \nTexas Legislature engaged in intentional vote dilution in \n2013  when  it  adopted  Congressional  District  27,  and \nState  House  Districts  32,  34,  54,  55,  103,  104,  and  105, \nwithout change from the court’s own 2012 interim plans.  \nThe  court  rested its  rulings  on  determinations  that  the \nState’s  original  2011  plans  were  tainted  with  “discrimi-\nnatory  intent”  and  that  the  Legislature  failed  to \n“cleanse”  that  intent  in  enacting  its  new  2013  plans.  \nC.J.S. App. 44a.  But in deciding whether the 2013 plans \nwere intentionally discriminatory, the court should have \nevaluated the intent of the 2013 Legislature, and should \nhave  applied  the  familiar  principles  for  discerning  the \nintent of a legislative body, which include a presumption \nof good faith.  That presumption should be particularly \nstrong  here,  because  the  Legislature  enacted  the  in-\nterim plans adopted by the district court.  Viewed under \nthe  correct  legal  framework,  the  evidence  invoked  by \nthe  district  court,  and  discussed  by  plaintiffs  in  their \nmotions to dismiss or affirm in this Court, would not be \nsufficient to overcome that strong presumption of good \nfaith and to establish discriminatory intent.   \n\nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Of Intentional Vote Dilution Require \nThem To Show That The 2013 Legislature Acted With A \nDiscriminatory Racial Purpose  \n\nPlaintiffs claim that the 2013 plans (Plans C235 and \nH358)  intentionally  diluted  the  voting  strength  of  mi-\nnority voters in several districts in violation of Section \n2  of  the  VRA  and  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.    The",
        "25 \n\nprinciples for adjudicating those claims are well estab-\nlished.   \n\n1.  A  legislative  enactment  may  be  invalidated  on \ngrounds of intentional discrimination only if the legisla-\nture  “acted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose.”    Reno  v. \nBossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 481 (1997).  “ ‘Dis-\ncriminatory purpose’  * * *  implies more than intent as \nvolition or intent as awareness of consequences.  It im-\nplies  that  the  decisionmaker  selected  or  reaffirmed  a \nparticular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an iden-\ntifiable  group.”    Personnel  Adm’r  v.  Feeney,  442  U.S. \n256, 279 (1979) (citation omitted).  Thus, “even if a neu-\ntral law has a disproportionately adverse effect upon a \nracial  minority,  it  is  unconstitutional  under  the  Equal \nProtection Clause only if that impact can be traced to a \ndiscriminatory purpose.”  Id. at 272.   \n\nThe inquiry into a legislature’s motivation is an “in-\nherently  complex  endeavor.”    Hunt  v.  Cromartie,  526 \nU.S. 541, 546 (1999).  “Outright admissions of impermis-\nsible racial motivation are infrequent.”  Id. at 553.  More \ncommonly,  “[d]etermining  whether  invidious  discrimi-\nnatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sen-\nsitive  inquiry  into  such  circumstantial  and  direct  evi-\ndence of intent as may be available.”  Village of Arling-\nton Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n252, 266 (1977); see Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 618 \n(1982)  (recognizing  that  “an  invidious  discriminatory \npurpose” may often be “inferred from the totality of the \nrelevant facts”) (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. \n229,  242  (1976)).    The  determination  of  a  legislature’s \nmotivation,  though  guided  by  legal  principles,  is  ulti-\nmately an issue of fact.  See Hunt, 526 U.S. at 549 (“The \nlegislature’s motivation is itself a factual question.”).",
        "26 \n\nIn  Arlington  Heights,  this  Court  set  forth  several \nconsiderations in analyzing “whether invidious discrim-\ninatory  purpose  was  a  motivating  factor”  in  a  govern-\nment body’s decisionmaking.  429 U.S. at 266; see Boss-\nier  Parish,  520  U.S.  at  481  (noting  that  Arlington \nHeights “serve[s] as the framework for examining dis-\ncriminatory purpose in cases brought under the Equal \nProtection Clause”).  Under this framework, courts con-\nsider (1) whether the “impact of the official action  * * *  \nbears more heavily on one race than another”; (2) “the \nhistorical background of the decision”; (3) “[t]he specific \nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  challenged  deci-\nsion”; (4) any “[d]epartures from the normal procedural \nsequence”;  and  (5)  “[t]he  legislative  or  administrative \nhistory, especially  . . .  [any] contemporary statements \nby members of the decisionmaking body.”  Bossier Par-\nish,  520  U.S.  at  489  (quoting  Arlington  Heights,  429 \nU.S. at 266-268) (brackets in original).  This Court has \nrepeatedly applied this framework to assess legislative \nintent in the context of challenges to state redistricting \nplans.  See Hunt, 526 U.S. at 546-549; Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. 630, 644 (1993) (Shaw I); Rogers, 458 U.S. at 618.   \nIn performing this inquiry, the burden rests on the \n“plaintiff ” to “establish that the State  * * *  acted with \na discriminatory purpose.”  Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. at \n481; cf. Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 56 (2005) (recog-\nnizing  that  the  burden  of  proof  generally  rests  on  the \nparty  alleging  a  violation  of  federal  law); Voinovich  v. \nQuilter,  507  U.S.  146, 155-156  (1993)  (“Section  2, how-\never, places at least the initial burden of proving an ap-\nportionment’s  invalidity  squarely  on  the  plaintiff ’s \nshoulders.”).    If,  and  only  if,  a  plaintiff  proves  inten-\ntional  discrimination  does  the  burden  shift  to  the  de-\nfendant  to  establish  any  available  defense,  such  as  by",
        "27 \n\nshowing  that  it  would  have  taken  the  same  action  for \nvalid reasons even absent impermissible discrimination.  \nSee Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, \n429 U.S. 274, 285-286 (1977). \n\n2.  The Court has recognized several additional prin-\nciples relevant to adjudicating claims of unlawful racial \nintent in the context of state legislative redistricting.   \n\nFirst, this Court has emphasized in the redistricting \ncontext that courts must accord a “presumption of good \nfaith [to] legislative enactments.”  Hunt, 526 U.S. at 553 \n(quoting  Miller  v.  Johnson,  515  U.S.  900,  916  (1995)).  \nThe Court has explained that “[f ]ederal-court review of \ndistricting legislation represents a serious intrusion on \nthe most vital of local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915, \nbecause  legislative  apportionment  is  “primarily  the \nduty and responsibility of the State,” Shelby County v. \nHolder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2623 (2013) (quoting Perry v. Pe-\nrez, 565 U.S. 388, 392 (2012)) (per curiam); see Cooper v. \nHarris,  137  S. Ct.  1455,  1463  (2017)  (“The  Constitution \nentrusts  States  with  the  job  of designing  congressional \ndistricts.”).  For that reason, “courts must ‘exercise ex-\ntraordinary  caution  in  adjudicating  claims  that  a  State \nhas drawn district lines on the basis of race.’ ”  Bethune-\nHill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 797 \n(2017) (quoting Miller, 515 U.S. at 916). \n\nSecond,  this  Court  has  explained  that,  although  in-\nquiry into the effects of a challenged action “may pro-\nvide an important starting point” for analysis, “official \naction will not be held unconstitutional solely because it \nresults in a racially disproportionate impact.”  Arling-\nton Heights, 429 U.S. at 264-266 (citing Davis, 426 U.S. \nat 242); see also, e.g., Coleman v. Court of Appeals, 566 \nU.S.  30,  42  (2012)  (plurality  opinion).    Thus,  a  State’s",
        "28 \n\ndecision to “choose a redistricting plan that has a dilu-\ntive impact does not, without more, suffice to establish \nthat  the  jurisdiction  acted  with  a  discriminatory  pur-\npose.”  Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. at 487-488; cf. Miller, \n515 U.S.  at  914  (stating  in  racial-gerrymandering  con-\ntext  that “impact  alone” is  usually “not determinative, \nand the Court must look to other evidence of race-based \ndecisionmaking”). \n\nThird, this Court has recognized that a finding of in-\ntentional discrimination in a prior legislative enactment \nis ordinarily insufficient, standing alone, to support an \ninference of intentional discrimination in a later enact-\nment.   “[P]ast discrimination cannot, in  the manner  of \noriginal sin, condemn governmental action that is not it-\nself unlawful.”  City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 74 \n(1980)  (plurality  opinion).    Of  course,  “[t]he  historical \nbackground”  to  a  challenged  enactment  is  a  relevant \nconsideration,  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  267,  in-\ncluding evidence pertaining to events that are “reason-\nably  contemporaneous  with  the  challenged  decision,” \nMcCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987).  But \neven when a prior finding of intentional discrimination \nwas  recent,  “[t]he  ultimate  question”  under  Arlington \nHeights  must be  “whether  a discriminatory intent  has \nbeen proved in [the] given case”—that is, for the partic-\nular challenged enactment.  City of Mobile, 446 U.S. at \n74 (plurality opinion).  \n\nFourth, this Court’s decisions indicate that, when a \nState  enacts  a  new  redistricting  plan  in  response  to  a \njudicial order holding a prior plan unconstitutional, the \nplaintiff retains the burden of proof in any challenge to \nthe  State’s  new  plan.    This  Court  has  long  recognized \nthat when a federal court has determined that a new ap-\nportionment  is  required,  a  State  “should  be  given  the",
        "29 \n\nopportunity  to  make  its  own  redistricting  decisions  so \nlong as that is practically possible.”  Lawyer v. Depart-\nment  of  Justice,  521  U.S.  567,  576  (1997);  see  Wise  v. \nLipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978) (principal opinion).  \nAnd even when practical necessities dictate the imple-\nmentation  of  a  court-drawn  map  in  the  first  instance, \nStates  nonetheless  remain  “free  to  replace  court- \nmandated  remedial  plans  by  enacting  redistricting \nplans of their own.”  League of United Latin Am. Citi-\nzens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 416 (2006) (LULAC) (opin-\nion of Kennedy, J.); see Wise, 437 U.S. at 540 (principal \nopinion);  Burns  v.  Richardson,  384  U.S.  73,  85  (1966).  \nWhen  a  State  avails  itself  of  that  opportunity,  “[t]he \nnew  legislative  plan    * * *    will  then  be  the  governing \nlaw unless it, too, is challenged and found to violate the \nConstitution.”  Wise, 437 U.S. at 540 (principal opinion);  \naccord id. at 548 (opinion of Powell, J., joined by three \nother Justices concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment); id. at 550 (Marshall, J., dissenting, joined by \ntwo other Justices) (agreeing with the relevant portion \nof  the  principal  opinion);  see  also  Mississippi  State \nChapter, Operation PUSH, Inc. v. Mabus, 932 F.2d 400, \n408-409 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that plaintiff had failed \nto “establish[] that the Mississippi Legislature” had “a \nracially discriminatory purpose” in enacting its legisla-\ntive remedy for a Section 2 violation).   \n\n3.  The foregoing principles, taken together, suggest \na further principle.  In considering the “historical back-\nground”  and  “specific  sequence  of  events”  leading  to  a \nrevised legislative action, Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at \n267, a court should afford particular weight to a state leg-\nislature’s reliance on a court’s determination that a par-\nticular remedy is both necessary and likely sufficient to \ncure a legal violation.  When, as here, a court has found",
        "30 \n\nthat an interim plan is sufficient to redress all likely vio-\nlations  of  law,  and  when  the  state  legislature  perma-\nnently adopts that plan to replace its original enactment, \nthe normal presumption of good faith accorded to legis-\nlative  enactments  is  heightened  by  the  State’s  ac-\nceptance of the judicial plan.  Courts should operate from \na  strong  presumption  that  the  state  legislature’s  adop-\ntion of the judicially approved remedy was due to good-\nfaith compliance efforts rather than sinister motives.  \n  Applying a strong presumption of good faith in this \ncontext would not direct an answer to the intent inquiry \nas a matter of law.  Even when a state legislature per-\nmanently adopts a remedy that a court has provisionally \ndeclared to be lawful, a plaintiff may attempt to prove \nthat  the  legislature  adopted  that  remedy  not  in  good \nfaith, but rather for the purpose of harming racial mi-\nnorities and perpetuating unlawful discrimination.  Cf. \nHayden  v.  Paterson,  594  F.3d  150,  167  (2d  Cir.  2010) \n(contemplating  the  “possibility  that  a  legislative  body \nmight  seek  to  insulate  from  challenge  a  law  known  to \nhave been originally enacted with a discriminatory pur-\npose”).    The  legislature’s  adoption  of  a  court-ordered \nplan cannot immunize a State from all possible liability, \nincluding for intentional wrongdoing when it exists.  Cf., \ne.g.,  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  416  (opinion  of  Kennedy,  J.) \n(“Judicial respect for legislative plans  * * *  cannot jus-\ntify legislative reliance on improper criteria for district-\ning  determinations.”);  Weinberger  v.  Wiesenfeld,  420 \nU.S. 636, 648 n.16 (1975) (recognizing that courts “need \nnot  * * *  accept at face value assertions of legislative \npurposes” if “examination of the legislative scheme and \nits  history  demonstrates  that  the  asserted  purpose \ncould not have been a goal of the legislation”).  Plaintiffs \nshould  bear  a  heavy  burden,  however,  in  establishing",
        "31 \n\nthat  a  state  legislature’s  adoption  of  a  court-ordered \nplan was intentionally discriminatory. \n\nB.  The  District  Court  Incorrectly  Presumed  Discrimina-\ntory  Intent  And  Shifted  The  Burden  Of  Proof  To  The \nState \n\nRather  than  applying the settled framework  for in-\ntentional vote-dilution claims, the district court under-\ntook a fundamentally different analysis.  The court did \nnot ask whether plaintiffs had proven that the Legisla-\nture, in enacting the 2013 plans, acted with the purpose \nof  harming  minority  voters.    Instead,  the  court  asked \nwhether  the  State  had  shown  that  it  had  removed  the \n“taint of discriminatory intent” associated with certain \ndistricts in its 2011 plans.  C.J.S. App. 38a.11  The court’s \nanalysis reflects several legal errors. \n\n1.  First, the district court incorrectly assumed that \ndiscriminatory  intent  associated  with  old  legislation \npersists  into  new  litigation  unless  that  prior  intent  is \nconfronted and somehow affirmatively extirpated.  The \ncourt faulted the Legislature for not undertaking a “de-\nliberative  process  to  ensure  that  the  2013  plans  cured \nany  taint  from  the  2011  plans.”    C.J.S.  App.  40a.    The \ncourt  concluded  that,  in  light  of  that  failure,  “the  ra-\ncially  discriminatory  intent    * * *    that  it  previously \nfound  in  the  2011  plans  carr[ied]  over  into  the  2013 \nplans where those district lines remain unchanged.”  Id. \n\n11  The district court briefly recited the Arlington Heights frame-\nwork in the background of its opinion, see C.J.S. App. 27a, but its \nanalysis did not follow that framework.  The sole arguable applica-\ntion of Arlington Heights appeared in a footnote, in which the dis-\ntrict  court  observed  that  the  “history  of  discrimination”  in  Texas \n“support[ed]”  the  court’s  findings  under  its  taint  analysis.    Id.  at \n38a-39a n.27.",
        "32 \n\nat 46a; see id. at 117a (same); H.J.S. App. 6a (incorpo-\nrating same analysis).   \n\nThat  presumption  of  persistent  discriminatory  in-\ntent  is  inconsistent  with  the  analysis  required  by  this \nCourt’s decisions.  See pp. 26-30, supra.  It also makes \nlittle sense.  Whether intentional discrimination existed \nin  enacting  the  2013  redistricting  plans  is  a  question \nabout the motives of the 2013 Legislature.  Although un-\nder  Arlington  Heights  as  applied  in  the  redistricting \ncontext,  a  history  of  prior  discrimination by  a state  or \nlocal  legislative  body  can  be  relevant,  the  central  in-\nquiry is whether the legislature that enacted the partic-\nular law at issue did so for an impermissible purpose. 12  \nLegislative intent is not an artifact that “carr[ies] over” \nfrom one law to the next; it must be decided anew with \neach  successive  enactment.    See,  e.g.,  City  of  Mobile, \n446 U.S. at 74 (plurality opinion) (inquiring “whether a \n\n12  In its jurisdictional statement, Texas appears to contend (C.J.S. \n25-28) that the district court impermissibly relied on factual findings \nabout  the  2011  Legislature’s  intent  because claims concerning  the \n2011 plans were moot.  Regardless of whether the claims concerning \nthe 2011 plans were moot, the district court was not foreclosed, un-\nder  the  Arlington  Heights  analysis  in  this  redistricting  context, \nfrom  considering  the  “historical  background  of ”  and  “sequence  of \nevents leading up to” enactment of the 2013 redistricting plans, in-\ncluding whether the 2011 Legislature acted with discriminatory in-\ntent.    But  the  pertinent  question  is  whether  the  2013  plans  were \nunlawful,  and  those  plans  are  entitled  to  a  strong  presumption  of \nvalidity because the Texas Legislature enacted the court’s own in-\nterim plans with little or no change.  As explained below, evidence \nconcerning  the  2011  plans  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  overcome  that \npresumption and establish impermissible intent on the part of the \n2013 Legislature, and neither the district court nor plaintiffs in their \nmotions to dismiss or affirm have identified other evidence that does \nso.  See pp. 40-44, infra.",
        "33 \n\ndiscriminatory intent has been proved” as to the partic-\nular  enactment  at  issue,  because  “past  discrimination \ncannot  * * *  condemn governmental action that is not \nitself unlawful”); cf. Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, \n225  (1971)  (contemplating  that  a  law  invalidated  be-\ncause of improper motive might “be valid” if the legisla-\nture “repassed it for different reasons”). \n\nIn support of its belief that the discriminatory intent \nfrom 2011 “carr[ied] over” into 2013, the district court \ninvoked this Court’s decision in Hunter v. Underwood, \n471 U.S. 222 (1985).  See C.J.S. App. 35a (“With regard \nto  those  areas  in  Plan  C185  and  Plan  H283  where  the \nCourt  found  that  [the]  district  lines  were  drawn  with \nimpermissible  motive    * * *    ,  Hunter  indicates  that \nthose  portions  of  the  plans  remain  unlawful.”).    But \nHunter did  not involve  a subsequent  legislative  enact-\nment  at  all.    Rather,  the  question  was  whether  a  1901 \nprovision of the Alabama Constitution, which provided \nfor  the  disenfranchisement  of  persons  “convicted  of, \namong other offenses, ‘any crime  . . .  involving moral \nturpitude,’ ”  was  invalid  because  it  had  been  adopted \nwith the purpose of disenfranchising black voters.  471 \nU.S.  at  223.   In defending the  constitutionality  of that \nprovision, Alabama urged that the passage of time, cou-\npled  with  intervening  judicial  rulings  narrowing  the \npredicate crimes giving rise to disenfranchisement, had \nvitiated any intentional discrimination.   \n\nThis Court rejected that proposition, explaining that \nthe prior judicial invalidation of “[s]ome of the more bla-\ntantly  discriminatory  selections”  of  crimes  (including \n“miscegenation”) did not cure the intentional discrimi-\nnation  motivating  other  then-surviving  provisions.  \nHunter,  471 U.S.  at  233.    But  Hunter  specifically  con-\ntemplated  that  a  different  analysis  would  apply  if  the",
        "34 \n\nchallenged  provisions  had  been  reenacted  at  a  later \ntime, and reserved the question whether the challenged \nprovision “would be valid if enacted today without any \nimpermissible motivation.”  Ibid.; see City of Cleburne \nv.  Cleburne  Living  Ctr.,  473  U.S.  432,  465  n.17  (1985) \n(Marshall,  J.,  concurring  in  the  judgment  in  part  and \ndissenting  in  part)  (describing  Hunter  as  “h[olding] \nthat  extant  laws  originally  motivated  by  a  discrimina-\ntory  purpose  continue  to  violate  the  Equal  Protection \nClause,  even  if  they  would  be  permissible  were  they \nreenacted without a discriminatory motive”); Cotton v. \nFordice,  157  F.3d  388,  391 (5th  Cir.  1998)  (noting  that \nHunter “left open the possibility that by amendment, a \nfacially neutral provision  * * *  might overcome its odi-\nous origin”).   \n\nConsistent with that understanding of Hunter, sev-\neral  courts  of  appeals  have  recognized  that,  when  a \nState reenacts a particular voting provision that was in-\ntentionally  discriminatory  when  first  enacted,  the  ulti-\nmate focus in any subsequent litigation must be the in-\ntent  of  the  reenacting  legislature,  not  the  original  one.  \nSee  Hayden,  594  F.3d  at  166-167  (addressing  felon- \ndisenfranchisement law); Johnson v. Governor, 405 F.3d \n1214,  1223-1224  (11th  Cir.)  (en  banc)  (same),  cert.  de-\nnied, 546 U.S. 1015 (2005); Cotton, 157 F.3d at 391-392 \n&  n.7  (same);  Chen  v.  City  of  Houston,  206  F.3d  502, \n520-521  (5th  Cir.  2000)  (addressing  racial-gerryman-\ndering claim), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1046 (2001).  Those \ncourts also have rejected the proposition that prior in-\ntent “remains legally operative” unless and until some \naffirmative  contrary  showing  is  made.    Johnson,  405 \nF.3d at 1223; see Hayden, 594 F.3d at 166-167 (quoting \nand  citing  Johnson  with  approval);  accord Cotton,  157 \nF.3d  at  392  (reaffirming  that  plaintiff  was  required  to",
        "35 \n\nshow that the “current version” of the law was “adopted \nout of a desire to discriminate”) (emphasis added). 13  \n\n13  The district court declared that the “most relevant case” sup-\nporting  its  analysis  was  Chen  v.  City  of  Houston,  supra,  but  that \ndecision is fully consistent with the above-stated principles.  C.J.S. \nApp. 35a; cf. id. at 35a-39a.  In Chen, the plaintiffs alleged that the \nCity’s  1997  districting  plan  was  a  racial  gerrymander  insofar  as  it \n“substantially maintained the borders of previous plans” from 1991, \n1993, and 1995 in which race had allegedly predominated.  206 F.3d \nat 513.  The Fifth Circuit explained that, although “evidence of in-\ntent garnered from [those] prior plans” was relevant, “the state of \nmind involved in the prior plans [was] not of itself what is precisely \nand directly the ultimate issue before the [c]ourt in this case.”  Id. \nat 521.  Rather, the court recognized that the “state of mind of the \nreenacting  body” controls  the  analysis,  and  observed that  the  “in-\ntervening reenactment with meaningful alterations may render the \ncurrent law valid” even if the prior law was unconstitutional.  Ibid.  \nThe court also applied a “presumption in favor of the Council’s good \nfaith,” id. at 520, and ultimately found that race had not predomi-\nnated either in 1997 or in the prior years at issue. \n\nThe district court also invoked Kirksey v. Board of Supervisors, \n554 F.2d 139 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 968 (1977), \nwhich reasoned that the “benign nature” of a new redistricting plan \n“cannot insulate the redistricting government entity from the exist-\ning taint” of a prior “intentional and purposeful discriminatory de-\nnial  of  access.”   Id.  at  146-147;  see  C.J.S.  App.  33a n.34,  45a.   But \nKirksey  dates  from  the  pre-City  of  Mobile  era  in  which  the  Fifth \nCircuit had concluded that a constitutional vote-dilution claim could \nbe  proven  by  either  discriminatory  purpose  or  discriminatory  ef-\nfects.  Cf. Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 369, 377-378 (5th \nCir. 1984) (describing history).  And to the extent “th[e] [Kirksey] \ncourt determined that a [constitutional] voting dilution case did not \nnecessarily  require  intent  where  a  political  system  demonstrably \ncontinued the effects of historical discrimination,” the Fifth Circuit \nlater rejected that approach, recognizing that a constitutional vote-\ndilution claim must “satisfy the purpose standard generally applica-\nble in equal protection cases.”  Id. at 377.",
        "36 \n\n2.  In imposing a legal obligation on the Legislature \nto “ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the \n2011 plans,” C.J.S. App. 40a, the district court also ef-\nfectively  shifted  the  burden  of  proof  to  Texas.    As  ex-\nplained  above,  the  burden  rests  on  the  “plaintiff [s]”  \nto “establish that the State  * * *  acted with a discrim-\ninatory  purpose.”    Bossier  Parish,  520  U.S.  at  481.   \nAlthough  the  court  did  not  expressly  state  that  it  was \nshifting the burden of proof, its conclusions that “[t]he \ndiscriminatory  taint  was  not  removed  by  the  Legisla-\nture’s  enactment  of  the  Court’s  interim  plans,”  C.J.S. \nApp.  46a  (emphasis  added),  and  that  “the  Legislature \ndid not engage in a deliberative process to ensure that \nthe 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans,” id. \nat 40a (emphasis added), rest on the evident assumption \nthat it was the State’s obligation to disprove discrimina-\ntory  intent  in  2013 rather  than plaintiffs’  obligation  to \nprove  it.14    In  shifting  that  burden,  the  district  court \noverrode  the  strong  “presumption  of  good  faith”  that \nthe State’s enactments should have enjoyed in these cir-\ncumstances.  Miller, 515 U.S. at 916; see p. 27, supra.   \nThe district court suggested that, absent a burden on \nTexas to show it has “removed” its prior bad intent, the \n2013  plans  would  be  “insulate[d]”  from  challenge  and \nplaintiffs would have “no remedy” for any “discrimina-\ntion  or  unconstitutional  effects” in  those  plans.   C.J.S. \nApp. 44a-45a & n.45.  That is incorrect:  plaintiffs here \ncould  have  attempted  to  prove  their  case  in  the  same \n\n14  The district court’s burden-shifting was invited by some plain-\ntiffs, who argued that the “State has the burden [in the litigation] to \nprove that its chosen remedy cures all of the defects found by the \nCourt”  in  the  2011  plan.    D. Ct.  Doc.  1525,  at  49  (July  31,  2017) \n(MALC post-trial brief ); see id. at 21, 40-42.",
        "37 \n\nway  as  all  other  similarly  situated  plaintiffs  in  redis-\ntricting  cases—namely,  by  establishing  that  the  2013 \nLegislature  enacted  the  2013  plans  for  impermissible \nracial  purposes.    And  to  do  that,  because  the  Legisla-\nture  adopted  court-ordered  remedial  plans,  plaintiffs \nshould  be  required  to  adduce  particularly  persuasive \nevidence in order to surmount the presumption that the \nLegislature  acted  lawfully.    But  the  possibility  that  a \nlegislature might act with nefarious motives in enacting \na court-approved plan cannot justify relieving plaintiffs \nof their burden to show that those motives exist.15 \n\nC.  This  Court  Should  Reject  The  Basis  For  The  District \n\nCourt’s Findings Of Intentional Discrimination \n\nIt  was  only  by  relying  on  the  flawed  premises  de-\nscribed above that the district court reached its conclu-\nsion  that  the  2013  plans  were  the  unlawful  product  of \nintentional discrimination.  Although the determination \nof  legislative  motive  is  a  “factual  question,” Hunt,  526 \nU.S. at 549, this Court retains “full power to correct a \ncourt’s errors of law,” including any “legal mistake[s]” \nunderlying factual findings.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464-\n1465,  1474;  see  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  427  (“Where  ‘the \nultimate finding of dilution’ is based on ‘a misreading of \nthe  governing  law’    * * *    there  is  reversible  error.”) \n\n15  The district court’s “insulat[ion]” concern also reflects its con-\nflation of the concepts of discriminatory intent and unlawful vote-\ndilutive  effect.    Although  success  on  plaintiffs’  intentional  vote- \ndilution claims would require proof that the 2013 Legislature acted \nfor a discriminatory purpose, plaintiffs’ Section 2 “results” claims \nrequire no such showing.  See pp. 4-5, supra.  Thus, as Texas has \nacknowledged, the fact that a re-enacting legislature does not act \nwith unlawful intent does not foreclose the possibility that “imper-\nmissible discriminatory effect may be carried over  * * *  from one \nversion of a law to another.”  C.J.S. 17.",
        "38 \n\n(quoting  Johnson  v.  De  Grandy,  512  U.S.  997,  1022 \n(1994)).  This Court should correct those legal errors.   \n\n1.   Application  of  a strong  presumption  of  good  faith is \n\nappropriate in this case \n\nThe  circumstances  of  this  case  confirm  the  sound-\nness of applying a strong presumption that the Legisla-\nture did not act with an impermissible racial purpose in \nadopting the 2013 redistricting plans.   \n\nFirst, the 2013 Legislature enacted plans that were \neither  identical  (for  the  congressional  plan)  or  nearly \nidentical (for the State House plan) to the interim plans \nthat  the district court  ordered  to be used  for  the  2012 \nelections.  A legislature’s adoption, entirely or substan-\ntially  without  amendment,  of  plans  that  have  received \njudicial approval indicates the legislature’s reliance on \nthe district court’s factual and legal determinations that \nthose plans are likely lawful.  \n\nSecond, in approving the 2012 interim plans, the dis-\ntrict court expressly considered each of plaintiffs’ chal-\nlenges under this Court’s Perry decision and concluded \nthat they either were “insubstantial” or had no “likeli-\nhood of success.”  Perry, 565 U.S. at 394-395.  The three-\njudge district court’s approval of the districts that were \nunchanged from the 2011 plan to the 2012 interim plan \nwas based on extensive evidentiary proceedings, includ-\ning a ten-day trial in 2011; a three-day hearing in 2011 \nregarding the first set of interim maps; a two-day hear-\ning in 2012 concerning the revised set of interim maps \non remand from Perry; and the court’s review of post-\ntrial briefing from the nine-day preclearance trial in the \nD.C.  district  court.    C.J.S.  App.  380a.    The  district \ncourt’s evaluation of plaintiffs’ claims under Perry, and \nits determination that the 2012 interim plans were law-",
        "39 \n\nful under that standard, gave the Legislature good rea-\nson to believe that the court’s 2012 interim plans were a \nlawful basis for the 2013 plans.   \n\nAs to the congressional plan, the district court found \nthat  CD27  likely  did  not  violate  Section  2  of  the  VRA \nbecause  the  court  had  restored  CD23  as  a  Latino  \nopportunity district.  C.J.S. App. 421a.  With respect to \nCD35, the court found that race had not predominated \nin its creation and that the district would not fail strict \nscrutiny in any event.  Id. at 409a-415a.  The court like-\nwise stated that in preserving the unaltered districts in \nthe  State  House  plan,  it  was  “following  the  Supreme \nCourt’s direction to leave undisturbed any district that \nis  free  from  legal  defect.”    H.J.S.  App.  303a  (citing \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 393-394).  The court thus adopted the \n2012 interim plans only after considering, albeit prelim-\ninarily, the merits of all pending VRA and constitutional \nchallenges.   \n\nThird,  the  district  court’s  2012  interim  plans  made \nnumerous ameliorative changes to other districts, which \nsupported the Legislature’s conclusion that the interim \nplans  had  likely  cured  any  defects  in  the  2011  plans.  \nThe \ninterim  congressional  plan  made  significant \nchanges to nine congressional districts, which included \nrestoring CD23 as a Latino opportunity district.  C.J.S. \nApp. 417a-421a.  The court concluded that the restora-\ntion of CD23 “substantially addresse[d]” any Section 2 \nviolation  involving  Latino  voters  in  South  and  West \nTexas,  including  those  residing  in  Nueces  County \n(CD27).  Id. at 421a.  After that change, there were at \nleast eleven congressional districts in the 2012 interim \nplan  in  which  minority  voters  had  the  opportunity  to \nelect their candidates of choice, as opposed to only ten \nsuch districts in the 2011 plan.  Id. at 297a, 399a.",
        "40 \n\nSimilarly,  in  the  interim  State  House  plan, the  dis-\ntrict  court  made  “substantial[]”  changes  to  21  State \nHouse districts.  H.J.S. App. 314a.  The number of mi-\nnority opportunity districts in the State House plan was \nthereby increased  from 45  or  46 in  the  2011  map  to  at \nleast 50 in the 2013 map.  See 11-cv-1303 Docket entry \nNo.  79-2,  at  8  (D.D.C.  Oct.  25,  2011)  (comparing  num-\nbers in 2011 map to those in benchmark pre-2011 map); \nH.J.S.  App.  308a-309a  (noting  that  2012  interim  plan \n“offset” any “retrogression” in the 2011 plan). \n  Fourth,  the  court-ordered  2012  plans  were  created \nas compromise maps acceptable to both the State and to \nseveral plaintiffs.  C.J.S. App. 6a, 368a; see D. Ct. Doc. \n660  (Feb.  16,  2012)  ( joint  advisory  filed by defendants \nand  by  the  Texas  Latino  Redistricting  Task  Force \nplaintiffs proposing interim congressional plan); D. Ct. \nDoc. 668 (Feb. 21, 2012) (same for interim State House \nplan).16  That some (although not all) plaintiffs approved \nof  the  interim  plans  further  supports  the  reasonable-\nness  of  the  Legislature’s  belief  that  those  plans  were \nlawful.   \n\n2.  Neither  the  district  court  nor  plaintiffs’  filings  to \ndate in this Court have identified sufficient evidence \nto rebut the strong presumption of good faith \nThe  district  court’s  orders  and  the  plaintiffs’  \njurisdictional-stage filings in this Court do not point to \nevidence  that  would  be  sufficient  to  rebut  the  strong \n\n16  Although the Texas Latino Redistricting Task Force plaintiffs \nhad alleged that the 2011 State House and congressional plans “di-\nlut[ed] Latino voting strength statewide,” D. Ct. Doc. 68, ¶ 21 (July \n25, 2011), those plaintiffs brought no challenges to the 2013 congres-\nsional plan, and as to the 2013 State House plan those plaintiffs chal-\nlenged only a single district (HD90, which was modified in 2013 from \nthe district court’s interim plan).  C.J.S. App. 12a-13a.",
        "41 \n\npresumption of good faith that applies to the 2013 Leg-\nislature’s  re-adoption  of  the  unchanged  districts  from \nthe district court’s interim plan.  The district court re-\nlied  on  its  assessment  that  the  “Legislature  did  not \nadopt the [2012 interim] plans with the intent to adopt \nlegally compliant plans free from discriminatory taint,” \nC.J.S. App. 40a, but rather as a “litigation strategy de-\nsigned  to  insulate the 2011  or  2013 plans  from  further \nchallenge,” id. at 41a.  Plaintiffs endorse that rationale \nin their filings in this Court.  See 17-586 Mot. to Dismiss \n12, 21 n.9; 17-626 MALC Mot. to Dismiss 29.  But those \nassertions appear not to rest on evidence, but rather on \na misunderstanding of the law.   \n\nTo  the  extent  Texas  adopted  the  2013  plans  with  a \nview  to  resolving  existing  litigation  against  the  2011 \nplans, it is unclear why the district court regarded that \nstrategy as inherently pernicious.  An intent to end liti-\ngation,  without  more,  is  not  an  intent  to  discriminate.  \nIndeed, the best way to end litigation is to adopt a re-\ndistricting  plan  that  complies  with  the  Voting  Rights \nAct and the Constitution.  And if a federal court has pro-\nvisionally determined that a particular action is unlawful \nand imposes an interim remedy, and if a legislature per-\nmanently adopts that remedy in lieu of continuing to con-\ntest the lawfulness of the original action, the State’s ac-\nceptance  of  the  judicial  plan  presumptively  furthers—\nnot frustrates—Congress’s goal in enacting the VRA of \nameliorating unlawful discrimination.   \n\nMoreover, even when a State replaces a judicial rem-\nedy without fully adopting it, this Court’s decisions re-\nquire  that  federal  courts  treat  such  plans  with  defer-\nence.  See pp. 28-29, supra.  It follows that a State that \nenacts a court-approved plan in order to obviate a need \nfor litigation concerning prospective compliance should",
        "42 \n\nreceive,  at  a  minimum,  the  same  deference.  Were  the \nlaw  otherwise,  every  state  legislative  remedy  under-\ntaken  against  the  backdrop  of  redistricting  litigation \nwould  be  presumptively  improper,  in  contravention  of \nthis Court’s “presumption of good faith” for state legis-\nlative  enactments,  Miller,  515  U.S.  at  915,  and  its  en-\ncouragement  of  state  legislative  remedies,  Wise,  437 \nU.S. at 540 (principal opinion).  Cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, \n557 U.S. 557, 581 (2009) (recognizing value of “voluntary \ncompliance” in Title VII context).   \n\nIn  any  event,  the  district  court  did  not  identify  the \nevidence  that  it  believed  supported  its  assertion  that \nthe  2013  Legislature  acted  with  an  intent  to  discrimi-\nnate  rather  than  an  “intent  to  adopt  legally  compliant \nplans.”  C.J.S. App. 40a.  Rather, the court’s statement \nappears to rest on its mistaken belief that the Legisla-\nture was under an affirmative obligation to undertake a \n“deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plan cured \nany taint from the 2011 plans,” ibid., and an ensuing in-\nference that the Legislature’s failure to discharge that \nobligation was proof of ill motive.  But to the extent that \nthe 2013 Legislature relied on the district court’s legal \nand  factual  judgments  rather  than  second-guessing \nthem,  such  reliance  is  more  naturally  understood  as  a \nsign of good faith.  Indeed, the Legislature’s refusal to \nadopt significant changes is consistent with a legislative \nintent to avoid creating (even inadvertently) new viola-\ntions of the VRA.   \n\nThe district court also cited evidence that the Legis-\nlature’s  counsel,  Jeff  Archer,  advised  legislators  that \nthe district court’s 2012 findings were preliminary and \ntherefore  not  “full  determinations”  on  the  merits  of \nevery claim.  C.J.S. App. 43a; see 17-586 Mot. to Dismiss \n21  (relying  on  same  evidence).    But  the  district  court’s",
        "43 \n\norders  on  the  2012  interim  plans  were,  at  a  minimum, \nhighly relevant in assessing Texas’s legal obligations and \nthe likely merits of plaintiffs’ claims.  The fact that the \nLegislature  knew  that  the  court-ordered  interim  maps \nwere not based on a final adjudication of plaintiffs’ claims \nconcerning the 2011 plans, and yet adopted those maps \nanyway, can quite reasonably be understood as reflect-\ning  the  Legislature’s  judgment  that  the  court-ordered \nmaps provided the best evidence available as to what re-\nmedial plans would comply with federal law.17  But in any \nevent, the non-final nature of the district court’s deter-\nminations  underlying  its  interim  plans  is  not,  without \nmore, affirmative evidence of discriminatory intent. \n\nThe district court also observed that the 2013 Legis-\nlature had “steadfast[ly] refus[ed]” to consider the pos-\nsibility  of  drawing  new  “coalition”  districts,  which  the \ndistrict court had earlier found “could be required” by \nthe VRA.  C.J.S. Pet. App. 40a; cf. p. 10 n.5, supra.  But \nthe  Legislature  may  have  believed  that  the  necessary \nfactual  predicate,  including  proof  of  cohesive  voting \namong  Hispanic  and  African-American  voters,  did  not \nexist  to  require  drawing  new  coalition  districts.   This \nCourt  had  stated  in  Perry  that  if  the  district  court,  in \nadopting its 2011 interim plans, had set out to create a \n\n17  Texas’s post-trial briefing before the district court cited sev-\neral pieces of record evidence consistent with this understanding.  \nSee,  e.g.,  JX-10.4  at  26  (Representative  Drew  Darby,  Chairman, \nHouse  Select  Committee  on  Redistricting)  (“[T]he  interim  maps \nrepresent the District Court’s best judgment as to  * * *  fully legal \nand  constitutional  redistricting  plans.”);  JX-13.4  at  151  (Repre-\nsentative Travis Clardy, Member, House Select Committee on Re-\ndistricting) (“[I]nterim means interim, I understand that, but it’s \na  good, fair  map  drawn  by  three  hard-working  impartial  federal \njudges who are very well acquainted with the law.  Don’t you think \nit’s reasonable that  * * *  we use those maps?”).",
        "44 \n\nminority coalition district, “it had no basis for doing so.”  \n565 U.S. at 399.  The district court also did not include \nany new coalition districts in its 2012 interim plans.  And \nthe  district  court  ultimately  rejected  plaintiffs’  claims \nthat the Legislature should have created additional co-\nalition districts in 2013.  See H.J.S. App. 7a, 9a-12a, 14a, \n16a, 20a-22a, 24a-26a, 85a; C.J.S. App. 49a-51a, 53a-85a.  \nFinally, the district court noted that the 2013 Legis-\nlature “pushed the redistricting bills through quickly in \na special session,” C.J.S. App. 40a, which began on May \n27, 2013, and ended on June 25, 2013.  But the Governor \nconvened a special session only because the Legislature \nhad  ended  its  regular  session  in  May  2013  without  any \nnew  redistricting  plans  to  replace  the  2011  plans,  for \nwhich  the  D.C.  district  court  had  denied  preclearance.  \nAnd because  the  Legislature  sits  in regular session  for \nonly 140 days every two years, see Tex. Const. art. III, \n§§ 5(a), 24(b), a special session was necessary if the Leg-\nislature was to adopt new redistricting plans before the \n2014 elections.  The “quick[ness]” of the special session \nmay  reflect  only  that  “no  [special]  session  shall  be  of \nlonger duration than thirty days.”  Id. § 40.  \n\nIII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  CONCLUDING \nIS  AN  \n\nTHAT  CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT  35 \nUNCONSTITUTIONAL RACIAL GERRYMANDER \n  A.  This Court  applies  a two-step  analysis in deter-\nmining whether a State has violated the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause through racial gerrymandering.  At the first \nstep, plaintiffs must prove that “race was the predomi-\nnant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place \na significant number of voters within or without” a par-\nticular  district.   Alabama Legislative Black Caucus  v. \nAlabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1267 (2015) (citation omitted).  \nAt  the  second  step,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  State  to",
        "45 \n\n“prove  that  its  race-based  sorting  of  voters  serves  a \n‘compelling  interest’  and  is  ‘narrowly  tailored’  to  that \nend.”  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (quoting Bethune-Hill, \n137  S. Ct.  at  800).    When  a  State  invokes  compliance \nwith the Voting Rights Act as the “compelling interest” \njustifying  its  race-based  apportionment,  it  must  show \nthat  it had  “ ‘good  reasons’ ”  for  concluding that  its  ac-\ntions  were  required  by  the  VRA.    Ibid.    (quoting  Ala-\nbama, 135 S. Ct. at 1274). \n\nB.  The district court erred in finding a racial gerry-\nmander in CD35.  As an initial matter, the 2013 Legisla-\nture  adopted  CD35 in its  present  form  in  2013  because \nthat  district  had  received  judicial  endorsement  in  the \ncourt-ordered  interim  congressional  plan.    Thus,  the \n“predominant” consideration in establishing the bounda-\nries of CD35 in 2013 was that they matched the district \nprovisionally deemed lawful by the three-judge court.  \n\nIn any event, the State had “good reasons” to believe \nthat  the  VRA  required  it  to  draw  CD35  in  2011  and \nmaintain it in 2013.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464.  The dis-\ntrict court’s own decision in 2012 concluded that Texas \nhad good reasons for drawing CD35 as it did.  Although \nthe  district  court  provisionally  concluded  in  2012  that \nrace did not predominate in drawing the district, it also \nfound  that  “[p]laintiffs  [had  not]  demonstrated  a  sub-\nstantial likelihood that CD35 would fail a strict scrutiny \nanalysis  [even]  if  strict  scrutiny  applies.”    C.J.S.  App. \n415a.  The court noted that Texas had defended CD35 \nin  the  preclearance  proceedings  as  a  “minority  oppor-\ntunity district,” id. at 411a, and it observed that CD35 \nhad been designed to have  a  “Hispanic  majority”  with \n“ ‘above 50 percent of [Hispanic citizen voting age pop-\nulation],’ ”  ibid.  (citation  omitted).    Indeed,  the  court \ncounted  CD35  among  the  seven  “Latino  opportunity",
        "46 \n\ndistricts” that it perceived as necessary to satisfy plain-\ntiffs’  Section  2  “results”  claims  in  South  and  West \nTexas.    Id.  at  409a.    Although  the  district  court’s  ap-\nproval  of  CD35  in  2012  was  provisional,  that  endorse-\nment  provided  at  least  “breathing  room”  for  Texas  to \nconclude, in 2013, that CD35 addressed a VRA need and \nthat maintaining it would not violate the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation omitted).  \nIn  addition  to  the  district  court’s  endorsement  of \nCD35 in 2012, there were other “good reasons” for Texas \nto  believe  that  Section  2  of  the  VRA  required  drawing \nCD35 as a Hispanic-majority district.  It is uncontested \nthat Section 2 required no fewer than seven Latino op-\nportunity  districts  in  South  and  West  Texas.    C.J.S. \nApp. 112a & n.85, 126a-127a, 176a.  And the State had \nreason to believe that CD35 would satisfy Gingles; map-\ndrawers and members of the Legislature in 2011 were \naware of substantial Hispanic populations in Austin and \nSan  Antonio,  and  were  furnished  with  analyses  of  ra-\ncially  polarized  voting  (RPV)  showing  information \nabout polarization statewide and in each district, includ-\ning  District  35.    See  C.J.S.  Supp.  App.  67a-69a,  201a, \n366a, 467a-469a, 481a-482a.  Indeed, one group of plain-\ntiffs  proposed  and  supported  the  creation  of  CD35  as \n“an appropriate § 2” Latino opportunity district during \nthe  2011  redistricting  process.    C.J.S.  App.  174a;  see \nC.J.S.  Supp.  App.  158a  (describing  CD35  as  a  “[n]ew \nHispanic VRA district”); C.J.S. Supp. App. 152a, 316a-\n317a, 319a-320a.  \n  C.  The district court’s ruling that CD35 failed “strict \nscrutiny review” because it was “not narrowly tailored to \nthe  State’s  professed  interest  in  avoiding  § 2  liability,” \nC.J.S.  App.  113a,  177a,  rests  on  misunderstandings  of",
        "47 \n\nSection 2’s requirements, the trial record, and the strict-\nscrutiny standards articulated by this Court.   \n  As explained (pp. 4-5, supra), to make a prima facie \nshowing of vote dilution under Section 2, a plaintiff must \nprove,  inter  alia,  that  the  majority  group  would  vote \n“sufficiently as a bloc to enable it  * * *  usually to defeat \nthe  minority’s  preferred  candidate.”    Thornburgh  v. \nGingles,  478  U.S.  30,  51  (1986)  (citation  omitted).    The \ndistrict court concluded that that precondition could not \nbe met for CD35 because “[e]vidence from county-level \nelections”  in  Travis  County  “shows  substantial  Anglo \ncrossover  voting,”  such  that  “the  Anglo  majority  does \nnot  usually  defeat  the  minority-preferred  candidate.” \nC.J.S.  App.  175a.    But  only  a  small  share  (21%)  of  the \ntotal  population  of  Travis  County  is  included  in  CD35.  \nId. at 181a.  The district court did not address whether \nvoting patterns were racially polarized within the par-\nticular portion of Travis County included in CD35, nor \ndid it address whether voting patterns were racially po-\nlarized across CD35 as a whole (i.e., including both ar-\neas inside and outside Travis County).  And the district \ncourt cited no precedent in support of its apparent as-\nsumption that a State necessarily lacks good reasons to \ndraw a Section 2 district any time that a district includes \n(or,  as  here,  partially  overlaps  with)  a  community  in \nwhich  racial  polarization  is  not  apparent.    To  the  con-\ntrary, this Court has recently reaffirmed that “the basic \nunit of analysis for racial gerrymandering claims  * * *  \nis the district,” and has stated that “[c]oncentrating on \nparticular portions [of the district] in isolation may ob-\nscure  the  significance  of  relevant  districtwide  evi-\ndence.”  Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 799-800. \n  Applying a “holistic analysis,” Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. \nat 800, the record confirms that it would be inappropriate",
        "48 \n\nto deem CD35 an improper Section 2 district solely be-\ncause of a purported lack of racially polarized voting in \nTravis  County.    See  D.  Ct.  Doc.  681-3,  at  7  (Feb.  28, \n2012).  The total population of CD35 is 698,488.  Ibid.  The \ntotal  Hispanic  population  of  CD35  is  438,819  persons, \nmore  than  two-thirds  of  whom  reside  outside  Travis \nCounty.    Ibid.    The  total  Anglo  population  of  CD35  is \n175,726  persons,  nearly  three-quarters  of  whom  reside \noutside  Travis  County.    Ibid.    Within  CD35,  the  Anglo \npopulation  from  Travis  County  is  only  45,272  persons.  \nIbid.  Thus, even assuming a showing that Anglos in the \ncovered  portion  of Travis  County did  not  engage in  ra-\ncially  polarized  voting,  that  would  fail  to  establish  that \nAnglos districtwide would not vote so as “usually to de-\nfeat  the  minority’s  preferred  candidate.”    Gingles,  478 \nU.S. at 51.  And it is uncontroverted that racially polar-\nized  voting  existed  throughout  the  counties  making  up \nthe majority of CD35.  See C.J.S. App. 21a (stating that \nthe existence of racially polarized voting outside Travis \nCounty was “essentially undisputed” and “supported by \nall the expert testimony in the case”). \n\nIn any event, even if the absence of racially polarized \nvoting  in  Travis  County  meant  that  CD35  was  not  re-\nquired  to  be  drawn  as  a  Section  2 district, the  district \ncourt  erred  in  finding  that  CD35  failed  strict  scrutiny \nfor that reason.  This Court’s precedents afford a State \n“ ‘breathing  room’  to  adopt  reasonable  compliance \nmeasures  that  may  prove,  in  perfect  hindsight,  not  to \nhave been needed.”  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation \nomitted).  Here, because the State had, at a minimum, \n“good  reason  to  think  that  all  the  ‘Gingles  precondi-\ntions’ [were] met,” “so too it ha[d] good reason to believe \nthat  §  2  require[d]  drawing  a  majority-minority  dis-\ntrict.”  Id. at 1470.",
        "49 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  should  reject \nthe  bases  for  the  district  court’s  findings  of  intentional \ndiscrimination  as  to  eight  unchanged  districts  (CD27, \nHD32,  HD34,  HD54,  HD55,  HD103,  HD104,  and \nHD105), and it should reverse the finding of a racial ger-\nrymander  as  to  the  remaining  unchanged  district \n(CD35). \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\n  NOEL J.

Appellants in-\nvoke  this  Court’s  jurisdiction  under  28  U.S.C.  1253.  \nThis Court  has  postponed  further  consideration of  the \nquestion of jurisdiction pending a hearing on the merits.   \n\nCONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY  \nPROVISIONS INVOLVED \n\nPertinent  constitutional  and  statutory  provisions  are \nreproduced in the appendices to the jurisdictional state-\nments.  See C.J.S. App. 426a-428a; H.J.S. App. 437a-439a. \n\nSTATEMENT \n\nThese appeals concern redistricting plans enacted by \nthe Texas Legislature in 2013 for the State’s House of \nRepresentatives  (the  State  House  plan)  and  for  the \nState’s Representatives in the United States House of \nRepresentatives  (the  congressional  plan).    The  2013 \nplans were based, entirely or almost entirely, on interim \nremedial plans that a three-judge court  of the District \nCourt  for  the  Western  District  of  Texas  adopted  in \n2012,  after  that  court had enjoined use  of  the  Legisla-\nture’s  prior  2011  redistricting  plans  pending  separate \npreclearance proceedings  in  the District  Court  for  the \nDistrict of Columbia.  In the decisions under review, the \ndistrict  court  invalidated  several  districts  in  the  2013 \ncongressional  and  State  House  plans  on  the  grounds \nthat  they  were  intentionally  discriminatory,  were  ra-\ncially gerrymandered, or caused unlawful vote dilution \n\n \n\f3 \n\nin violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Four-\nteenth  Amendment  or  the  Voting  Rights  Act  of  1965 \n(VRA), 52 U.S.C. 10301 et seq. (Supp. III 2015). 2 \n\nThe  United  States  intervened  in  the  Texas  district \ncourt to assert claims that the 2011 plans were enacted \nwith  racially  discriminatory  intent  in  violation  of  Sec-\ntion 2 of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. 10301.  The United States \nhas  not  brought  any  claims  challenging  the  2013  con-\ngressional  or  State  House  plans.    The  United  States \nnonetheless  retains  a  significant  interest  in  these  ap-\npeals because the United States, through the Attorney \nGeneral,  has  primary  responsibility  for  enforcing  the \nVRA.  See 52 U.S.C. 10308(d).  Accordingly, the United \nStates has a substantial interest in the proper interpre-\ntation of the VRA and the related constitutional protec-\ntion against the unjustified use of race in redistricting. \n1.  “[T]he  Constitution  leaves  with  the  States  pri-\nmary  responsibility  for  apportionment  of  their  federal \ncongressional and state legislative districts.”  Growe v. \nEmison, 507 U.S. 25, 34 (1993).  States have substantial \ndiscretion  to  make  the  judgments  and  compromises \nnecessary  to balance  the  complex  array  of  “competing \ninterests” involved in redistricting.  Miller v. Johnson, \n515  U.S.  900,  915  (1995).    At  the  same  time,  both  the \nConstitution and federal statutes impose constraints on \nredistricting in order to prevent racial discrimination. \na.   Section 2 of the VRA imposes a “permanent, na-\ntionwide ban on racial discrimination in voting.”  Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2631 (2013).  Section \n2 prohibits  any  “voting  qualification  or prerequisite to \nvoting or standard, practice, or procedure” that “results \nin a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of \n\n2  All references to Sections of the VRA are found in the 2015 Sup-\n\nplement of the United States Code.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f4 \n\nthe United States to vote on account of race or color.”  \n52 U.S.C. 10301(a).  As amended in 1982, Section 2 pro-\nvides  that  a  violation  may  be  “established  if,  based  on \nthe totality of circumstances, it is shown that the [elec-\ntion]  processes   * * *  in  the State  or political  subdivi-\nsion are not equally open to participation by members \nof a [protected] class [who] have less opportunity than \nother members of the electorate to participate in the po-\nlitical  process  and  to  elect  representatives  of  their \nchoice.”  52 U.S.C. 10301(b).   \n\nBoth Section 2 of the VRA and the Equal Protection \nClause  of  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  prohibit  inten-\ntional  “vote  dilution.”    Rogers  v.  Lodge,  458  U.S.  613, \n617,  621  (1982)  (Fourteenth  Amendment);  Garza  v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763, 766 (9th Cir. 1990) \n(Section  2),  cert. denied,  498  U.S.  1028 (1991);  S. Rep. \nNo. 417, 97th Cong., 2d Sess. 27 & n.108 (1982) (Senate \nReport) (same).  Vote dilution is caused “either ‘by the \ndispersal  of  [minority  voters]  into  districts  in  which \nthey constitute an ineffective minority of voters or from \nthe  concentration  of  [minority  voters]  into  districts \nwhere  they  constitute  an  excessive  majority.’ ”    Voino-\nvich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 154 (1993) (quoting Thorn-\nburgh v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 46 n.11 (1986)).   \n\nIn  addition,  vote  dilution  without  a  finding  of  dis-\ncriminatory intent may violate Section 2 under its “re-\nsults” test.  This Court has identified three “precondi-\ntions” for a vote-dilution claim under that test:  (1) The \nminority  group  must  be  “sufficiently  large  and  geo-\ngraphically compact to constitute a majority in a single-\nmember  district,” (2) the  minority group  must be “po-\nlitically cohesive,” and (3) the majority must “vote[] suf-\nficiently as a bloc” to usually “defeat the minority’s pre-\nferred  candidate.”    Gingles,  478  U.S.  at  50-51;  see \n\n \n\f5 \n\nCooper  v.  Harris,  137  S.  Ct.  1455,  1470  (2017).    For  \nsingle-member districting schemes,  the  first precondi-\ntion  also  requires  showing  a  “possibility  of  creating \nmore  than  the existing  number  of reasonably  compact \ndistricts with a sufficiently large minority population to \nelect candidates of its choice.”  Johnson v. De Grandy, \n512 U.S. 997, 1008 (1994).  If a party establishes those \npreconditions, a court then must “consider the ‘totality \nof  circumstances’  to  determine  whether  members  of  a \nracial group have less opportunity than do other mem-\nbers of the electorate.”  League of United Latin Am. Cit-\nizens  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  425-426  (2006)  (LULAC) \n(quoting De Grandy, 512 U.S. at 1011-1012); see Senate \nReport  27-29  (articulating  factors  to  consider).    The \nCourt has reserved the question of how “intentional dis-\ncrimination affects the Gingles analysis” for a Section 2 \nclaim.  Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 20 (2009) (plu-\nrality opinion).   \n\nb.  The Equal Protection Clause, in addition to pro-\nhibiting  intentional  vote  dilution,  forbids  the  unjusti-\nfied,  predominant  use  of  race  in  drawing  districts, \nknown  as  “unconstitutional  racial  gerrymandering.”  \nShaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (Shaw I).  Such \na  claim  is  “ ‘analytically  distinct’  from  a  vote  dilution \nclaim.”    Miller,  515  U.S.  at  911  (citation  omitted).    In \nadjudicating  a  racial-gerrymandering  claim,  the  court \nmust determine whether race was “the predominant fac-\ntor motivating the legislature’s decision to place a signif-\nicant  number  of  voters  within  or  without  a  particular  \ndistrict”—i.e.,  whether  race  is  the  “dominant  and  con-\ntrolling rationale” for a district’s lines.  Id. at 913, 916.  If \nso, that use of race comports with the Equal Protection \nClause only if it is narrowly tailored to serve a compel-\nling  state  interest.    Id.  at  920;  see  Hunt  v.  Cromartie,  \n\n \n\f6 \n\n526 U.S. 541, 547 (1999) (“[S]trict scrutiny applies if race \nwas ‘the predominant factor’ motivating the legislature’s \ndistricting decision.”). \n\nThis  Court  has  “long  assumed”  that  States  have  a \ncompelling  interest  in  complying  with  Section  2  of  the \nVRA.    Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1469;  see,  e.g.,  Abrams  v. \nJohnson, 521 U.S. 74, 91 (1997); Shaw v. Hunt, 517 U.S. \n899,  915 (1996)  (Shaw  II); Bush  v. Vera,  517  U.S.  952, \n978  (1996)  (plurality  opinion);  Bush,  517  U.S.  at  990 \n(O’Connor,  J.,  concurring).3    The  predominant  use  of \nrace  in  an  effort  to  comply  with  the  VRA  will  survive \nstrict scrutiny so long as a State has “a ‘strong basis in \nevidence’ in support of the (race-based) choice that it has \nmade.”  Alabama Legislative Black Caucus v. Alabama, \n135 S. Ct. 1257, 1274 (2015) (citation omitted).  A “strong \nbasis in evidence” exists so long as legislators “have good \nreasons to believe such use [of race] is required, even if \na court does not find that the actions were necessary for \nstatutory  compliance.”    Ibid.  (citation  omitted).    That \nstandard affords States “ ‘breathing room’ to adopt rea-\nsonable compliance measures that may prove, in perfect \nhindsight, not to have been needed.”  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. \nat 1464 (quoting Bethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of \nElections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 802 (2017)). \n\n2.  This  litigation  arises  from  redistricting  under-\ntaken by Texas following the 2010 Census.  The Census \nshowed  that  Texas  had  gained  more  than  four  million \n\n3  This Court also has repeatedly assumed that States have a com-\npelling interest in complying with Section 5 of the VRA.  See, e.g., \nBethune-Hill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 801 \n(2017) (rejecting racial-gerrymandering claim where the “State had \nsufficient grounds to determine that the race-based calculus it em-\nployed  * * *  was necessary to avoid violating § 5”). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f7 \n\nnew residents, which entitled it to four additional Rep-\nresentatives in the U.S. House of Representatives.  See \nPerry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 390 (2012) (per curiam).   \na.  In  June  2011,  the  Texas  Legislature enacted  re-\ndistricting plans for, as relevant here, the State House \n(Plan H283) and the U.S. congressional delegation (Plan \nC185).4  At that time, Section 5 of the VRA required the \nState to obtain preclearance before implementing those \nplans, a process that required it to show that the plans \n“neither ha[d] the purpose nor w[ould] have the effect” \nof discriminating on the basis of race.  52 U.S.C. 10304(a).  \nTexas sought preclearance for its 2011 plans by filing a \ndeclaratory-judgment  action  in  the  District  Court  for \nthe District of Columbia in July 2011. \n  Meanwhile, in June and July 2011, various plaintiffs \nbrought Section 2 and constitutional claims against the \n2011 congressional and State House plans, which were \nconsolidated  before a  three-judge  district  court  in  the \nWestern District of Texas.  That court enjoined use of \nthe  2011  plans  and—lacking  any  final decision  on pre-\nclearance from the D.C. district court—adopted interim \nredistricting plans to govern the 2012 elections.  In do-\ning  so,  the  district  court  believed  that  it  “was  not  re-\nquired  to  give  any  deference  to  the  Legislature’s  en-\nacted plan[s].”  Perry, 565 U.S. at 396 (citation and in-\nternal quotation marks omitted). \n\n4  The Legislature also enacted a redistricting plan for the State \nSenate, which led to separate litigation before the same three-judge \ncourt.    See  Davis  v.  Perry,  No.  11-788  (W.D. Tex.  Sept.  22,  2011).  \nFollowing adoption of a revised plan in 2013, the State Senate liti-\ngation was dismissed as  moot.  See Davis v. Abbott, 781 F.3d 207, \n209 (5th Cir.), cert. denied, 136 S. Ct. 534 (2015).  The State Senate \nplan is not at issue in these appeals.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f8 \n\nThis  Court  vacated  the  interim plans  and remanded \nfor  further  proceedings.    Perry,  565  U.S.  at  399.    The \nCourt  agreed  that,  absent  preclearance  of  the  State’s \n2011 plans, it was necessary for the district court to de-\nvise interim plans for the 2012 elections.  Id. at 392.  The \nCourt  concluded,  however,  that  the  district  court  had \nerred “[t]o the extent [it]  * * *  substituted its own con-\ncept  of  the  ‘collective  public  good’ ”  in  formulating  in-\nterim relief.  Id. at 396.  The Court concluded that “[the] \ndistrict court should take guidance from the State’s re-\ncently enacted plan,” to the extent the legislative poli-\ncies reflected in that plan “ ‘do not lead to violations of \nthe Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.’ ”  Id. at 393 \n(citation omitted). \n\nThis  Court  then  articulated  legal  standards  for  de-\nvising  interim  plans  on  remand.    When  portions  of  a \nState’s enacted plan are alleged to violate the Constitu-\ntion or Section 2 of the VRA, “a district court should still \nbe guided by that plan, except to the extent those legal \nchallenges are shown to have a likelihood of success on \nthe merits.”  Perry, 565 U.S. at 394.  When portions of \nthe  State’s enacted  plan are  the subject  of a  Section  5 \npreclearance  proceeding  elsewhere  that  has  not  yet \nbeen  completed,  the  district  court  must  “tak[e]  guid-\nance from a State’s policy judgments unless they reflect \naspects of the state plan that stand a reasonable proba-\nbility of failing to gain § 5 preclearance.”  Id. at 395.  The \nCourt reiterated that the district court “must, of course, \ntake  care  not  to  incorporate  into  the  interim  plan  any \nlegal defects in the state plan.”  Id. at 394.  \n\nb.  On remand, in February 2012, the Texas district \ncourt  ordered  the  use  of  revised  interim  plans  for  the \n2012 elections (Plans C235 and H309).  C.J.S. App. 367a-\n424a;  H.J.S.  App.  300a-315a.    Both  were  compromise \n\n \n\f9 \n\nplans  accepted  by  the  State  and  certain  plaintiffs.  \nC.J.S. App. 6a, 368a, 394a-395a. \n\nWith respect to congressional districting, Plan C235 \nmade significant changes to nine districts as compared to \nthe Legislature’s 2011 plan.  But it made no changes to \nthe  two  congressional  districts  now  at  issue:    CD27,  a  \nmajority-Anglo district covering Nueces County (which \nincludes  Corpus  Christi)  and  points  northward;  and \nCD35, a majority-Latino district extending from Travis \nCounty (Austin) to Bexar County (San Antonio).  C.J.S. \nApp. 408a, 419a.   \n\nBefore  2011,  CD27  had been  a  majority-Latino  dis-\ntrict that included Nueces County.  The 2011 version of \nCD27  still  included  the  concentration  of  Latino  voters \nin Nueces County, but placed them in a majority-Anglo \ndistrict.  C.J.S. App. 417a.  Various plaintiffs raised Sec-\ntion 2 claims and Section 5 arguments against the new \nCD27 (id. at 388a, 417a-423a), but the district court con-\ncluded  that  those  challenges  were  unlikely  to  succeed \nunder  the  standards  articulated  in  Perry.    The  court \nfound  that,  regardless  of  how  CD27  was  configured, \n“only 7 reasonably compact Latino opportunity districts \nc[ould] be drawn in compliance with § 2” in the “South \nand West Texas area.”  Id. at 418a, 421a.  And the court \nexplained  that  Plan  C235  would  restore  a  different  \ndistrict—CD23—as  a  Latino  opportunity  district, \nthereby ensuring that the plan had seven such districts.  \nThe court thus concluded that Plan C235 “substantially \naddresses the §  2  violation,”  and retention of  the  2011 \nversion of CD27 was appropriate in order to “respect[] \nthe Legislature’s policy decisions concerning the place-\nment of Nueces County.” Id. at 421a.  The court also did \nnot identify any retrogression concerns with CD27 un-\nder Section 5.  Cf. id. at 399a, 422a-423a. \n\n \n\f10 \n\n  As to CD35, one group of private plaintiffs urged the \ndistrict court to find it a proper Section 2 Latino oppor-\ntunity district, while others urged the court to reject it as \nan unconstitutional racial gerrymander or as intentionally \nvote  dilutive.    The  court  concluded  that  the  racial- \ngerrymandering claim was a “close call,” C.J.S. App. 409a, \nbut found that the challenge was likely without merit, both \nbecause  of  inadequate  evidence  that  race  had  predomi-\nnated in the creation of CD35 and because there was no \nsubstantial  likelihood  that  CD35  would  fail  strict  scru-\ntiny in any event.  Id. at 415a.  The court also found that \nplaintiffs had not shown that CD35 was created for the \ndiscriminatory purpose of “dismantling” a prior “crosso-\nver” district (CD25) rather than because of “partisan pol-\nitics.”  Ibid.5 \n    With respect to the State House, in ordering the use \nof  Plan  H309,  the  district  court  made  “substantial[]” \nchanges  to  21  districts.    H.J.S.  App.  314a.    But  Plan \nH309  retained  122  State  House  districts  without \nchange, including most of those now before this Court:  \nHD54  and  HD55  in  Bell  County;  HD32  and  HD34  in \nNueces County; and HD103, HD104, and HD105 in Dal-\nlas County.  Id. at 303a n.4.  The court explained that by \nkeeping  those  districts  unchanged,  it  was  “[f ]ollowing \n[this] Court’s direction to leave undisturbed any district \nthat is free from legal defect.”  Id. at 303a. \n\n5  A “crossover” district is “one in which minority voters make up \nless than a majority of the voting-age population,” but in which the \n“minority  population,  at  least  potentially,  is  large  enough  to  elect \nthe candidate of its choice with help from voters who are members \nof  the  majority  and  who  cross  over  to  support  the  minority’s  pre-\nferred  candidate.”    Bartlett,  556  U.S.  at  13  (plurality  opinion).    A \n“coalition” district is one in which “two minority groups form a coa-\nlition to elect the candidate of the coalition’s choice.”  Ibid.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f11 \n\nAlthough  the  district  court  found  that  Plans  C235 \nand  H309  satisfied  this  Court’s  standards  in  Perry,  it \nnoted that its decisions were preliminary and not final \nrulings on the merits of any claim concerning the 2011 \nplans.  C.J.S.  App.  367a;  H.J.S.  App.  315a.    The  2012 \nelections were conducted under Plans C235 and H309.  \nc.  In August 2012, the D.C. district court denied pre-\nclearance to Texas’s 2011 congressional and State House \nredistricting plans.  See Texas v. United States, 887 F. \nSupp. 2d 133 (three-judge court), vacated and remanded, \n133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013).  As to the congressional plan, the \ncourt concluded that Texas had failed to meet its burden \nunder Section 5 of the VRA to prove an absence of dis-\ncriminatory intent.  Id. at 159-166.  As to the State House \nplan, the court concluded that Texas had failed to meet \nits  burden  under  Section  5  to  establish  the  absence  of \nretrogressive effect, and also stated that the record sug-\ngested that that effect “may not have been accidental.”  \nId. at 178; see id. at 166-178.  The State appealed the de-\nnial of preclearance to this Court.  \n\nd.  In  March  2013—while  Texas’s  preclearance  ap-\npeal  was  pending,  and  while  the  litigation  below  was \nheld  in  abeyance—the  Texas  Attorney  General  pro-\nposed to the Legislature that it enact the district court’s \n2012 interim maps as the State’s permanent redistrict-\ning plans.  C.J.S. App. 429a-435a.  He observed that the \n2011 plans had been found by the D.C. district court to \nbe “tainted by evidence of discriminatory purpose,” and \nexplained  that  “the  best  way  to  remedy  the  violations  \n* * *  is  to  adopt  the  court-drawn interim plans  as  the \nState’s permanent redistricting maps.”  Id. at 432a.  In \nMay  2013,  the  Texas  Governor  called  the  Legislature \ninto  special  session  to  consider  that  proposal.    C.J.S. \nSupp. App. 231a. \n\n \n\f12 \n\nOn June 23, 2013, the Texas Legislature passed bills \nadopting  new  redistricting  plans.    The  Texas  Legisla-\nture adopted without alteration the court-ordered con-\ngressional  interim  map  (Plan  C235)  as  its  permanent \ncongressional  plan.    C.J.S.  App.  9a.    The  Legislature \nmade minor changes to the court-ordered State House \ninterim  map  and  then  enacted  that  map  as  its  perma-\nnent  State  House  plan  (Plan  H358).    Ibid.    The  2013 \nplans were signed into law on June 26, 2013, and became \neffective in September 2013.  C.J.S. Supp. App. 232a. \n\ne.  On June 25, 2013, this Court issued its decision in \nShelby County v. Holder, 133 S. Ct. 2612 (2013),  holding \nthat  the  coverage  formula  in  Section  4(b)  of  the  VRA \nwas unconstitutional and could “no longer be used as a \nbasis  for  subjecting  jurisdictions  to  preclearance”  un-\nder Section 5.  Id. at 2631.  This Court then vacated the \nD.C.  district  court’s  judgment  denying  preclearance, \n133 S. Ct.  2885,  and  on  remand,  that  court  granted \nTexas’s motion for voluntary dismissal.   \n\n3.  a.  Litigation in the Texas district court resumed.  \nThe court allowed plaintiffs to amend their complaints \nto challenge the newly enacted 2013 plans and, with re-\nspect to existing claims against the 2011 plans, to seek \nrelief under Section 3(c) of the VRA, 52 U.S.C. 10302(c).  \nD. Ct. Doc. 886, at 8-19 (Sept. 6, 2013). 6  The court or-\ndered,  however,  that  the  Legislature’s  newly  enacted \n2013 plans (Plans C235 and H358) would be used for the \n2014 elections.  Id. at 21-26.  The court noted that it had \n\n6  Section 3(c), known as the VRA’s “bail-in” provision, permits a \ndistrict court, upon a finding that “violations of the [F]ourteenth or \n[F]ifteenth  [A]mendment  justifying  equitable  relief  have occurred \nwithin the territory of [a] State or political subdivision,” to require \nthe defendant to seek approval of future voting changes through a \nregime similar to Section 5 preclearance.  52 U.S.C. 10302(c).   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f13 \n\n“already” conducted “a preliminary injunction analysis” \non  plaintiffs’  challenges  in  its  decisions  adopting  the \n2012 interim plans, id. at 22, and it found that the sole \n“new legal challenge” brought by plaintiffs (concerning \nHD90,  which  had  been  modified  by  the  2013  Legisla-\nture) was not likely to succeed, id. at 23-24.  The court \nacknowledged  it  still  needed  to  “reach  a  final  decision \non  the  merits  of  all  claims,”  but  concluded  that  it  was \n“impossible  to  reach  that  decision  prior  to  the  various \ndeadlines for the 2014 elections.”  Id. at 22. \n\nThe United States intervened in the litigation.  D. Ct. \nDoc. 904 (Sept. 24, 2013).  In its complaint, the United \nStates did not challenge the 2013 plans, but instead ar-\ngued  that  the  2011  plans  (Plans  C185  and  H283)  had \nbeen adopted with racially discriminatory intent in vio-\nlation of Section 2 and that Section 3(c) relief was war-\nranted.    D. Ct.  Doc.  907,  at  14  (Sept.  25,  2013).    The \nUnited States’ complaint asserted only intentional vote-\ndilution claims, and did not raise any Section 2 results \nclaims. \n  b.  In July and August 2014, the Texas district court \nconducted  bench  trials  on  the  claims  against  the  2011 \ncongressional and State House plans.  C.J.S. App. 13a.   \nIn October 2015, while a decision on the 2011 plans \nwas still pending, plaintiffs sought a preliminary injunc-\ntion barring the use of the 2013 plans for the 2016 elec-\ntions.  The court denied that request, explaining that the \n2013 plans were “the product of the [c]ourt’s preliminary \ninjunction analysis” in 2012, and concluding that “scruti-\nnizing the same plan[s] under the same preliminary in-\njunction  analysis  would  [not]  produce  a  different  out-\ncome today.”  D. Ct. Doc. 1324, at 5-6 (Nov. 6, 2015).  The \n2013 plans were therefore used for the 2016 elections.   \n\n \n \n\f14 \n\nc.  Two-and-a-half years after trial, in various orders \nissued  in  March  through  May  2017,  the  district  court \nheld by a 2-1 vote that Texas had violated the VRA, the \nConstitution, or both in drawing various districts in the \n2011  plans.    C.J.S.  App.  120a-366a;  H.J.S.  App.  88a-\n299a; see C.J.S. Supp. App. 1a-490a (separate findings \nof fact); H.J.S. Supp. App. 1a-309a (same). \n  As  relevant  here,  with  respect  to  the  2011  congres-\nsional plan, the district-court majority found that CD27 \nand  CD35  were  unlawful  (notwithstanding  the  district \ncourt’s prior provisional determinations to the contrary).  \nC.J.S. App. 161a-195a, 330a.  As to CD27, the court con-\ncluded that the placement of Hispanic voters in Nueces \nCounty  into  a  majority-Anglo  district  “had  the  effect \nand  was  intended  to  dilute  their  opportunity  to  elect \ntheir candidate of choice.”  Id. at 330a.  The court stated \nthat,  although  only  “seven  compact  Latino  opportunity \ndistricts could be drawn in South/West Texas,” “Nueces \nCounty Hispanics could be included in one of those dis-\ntricts  for  § 2  purposes.”    Id.  at  181a.    As  to  CD35,  the \ncourt concluded that the district was an unconstitutional \nracial gerrymander, finding that race had predominated \nin its construction and that the district could not survive \nstrict scrutiny.  Id. at 175a.  Judge Smith dissented, both \non the ground that the challenges to the 2011 plans were \nmoot and on the merits.  Id. at 331a-366a. \n\nWith  regard  to  the  2011  State  House  plan,  the  \ndistrict-court majority found that plaintiffs had proven \nintentional vote dilution on a statewide basis and also in \ncertain  regions.    H.J.S.  App.  192a,  275a.    The  specific \ndistricts invalidated because of discriminatory intent in-\ncluded those in Nueces County (HD32 and HD34), Bell \nCounty (HD54 and HD55), and Dallas County (HD103, \nHD104, and HD105).  Id. at 126a-137a, 164a-173a, 178a-\n\n \n \n\f15 \n\n183a, 275a.  Judge Smith again dissented on both moot-\nness and the merits.  Id. at 277a-299a.  \n\nAfter  issuing  those  decisions  on  the  2011  plans,  the \ndistrict court held a trial on the 2013 plans in July 2017.  \nBecause the United States asserted no claims against the \n2013 plans, it did not participate in the trial.   \n\nd.  In  decisions  issued  in  August  2017,  the  district \ncourt  invalidated  several  districts  in  the  State’s  2013 \ncongressional and State House plans.  See C.J.S. App. \n3a-119a; H.J.S. App. 3a-87a.  \n\nAs  relevant  here,  the  district  court  held  that  every \ndistrict it  had  found  to  be intentionally discriminatory \nor  racially  gerrymandered  in  the  2011  plans  was  also \nnecessarily unlawful in the 2013 plans “where th[e] dis-\ntrict lines remain[ed] unchanged.”  C.J.S. App. 46a; see \nid. at 35a; H.J.S. App. 6a.  The court acknowledged that \nthe  2013  Legislature  had  effectively  “adopted  the \n[c]ourt’s [interim] plans” from 2012, but reasoned that \nthat action “d[id] not change” the analysis because the \nLegislature “did not engage in a deliberative process to \nensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 \nplans.”  C.J.S. App. 40a.  Based on that conclusion, the \ncourt  suggested  that  the  Legislature  had  enacted  the \n2013 plans “as part of a litigation strategy” designed to \n“insulate”  the  State’s  actions  from  further  challenge, \nrather  than  as  an  attempt  to  “adopt  legally  compliant \nplans  free  from  discriminatory  taint.”    Id.  at  40a-41a.  \nThus,  as  to  the  2013  congressional  plan,  the  district \ncourt invalidated CD27 and CD35, see id. at 117a-118a, \nand  as  to  the  2013  State  House  plan,  the  court  invali-\ndated  HD32  and  HD34  (Nueces  County),  HD54  and \n\n \n\f16 \n\nHD55  (Bell  County),  and  HD103,  HD104,  and  HD105 \n(Dallas County), see H.J.S. App. 84a-85a.7 \n\nConcluding  that  these  violations  “must  be  reme-\ndied,” C.J.S. App. 117a; see H.J.S. App. 84a-85a, the dis-\ntrict court directed the Texas Attorney General to ad-\nvise the court “within three business days” whether the \nTexas Legislature would “take up redistricting in an ef-\nfort to cure these violations.”  C.J.S. App. 118a; H.J.S. \nApp. 86a.  The court further ordered that, absent such \nlegislative  redistricting,  it  would  hold  “hearing[s]  to \nconsider remedial plans” in early September 2017.  Ibid.   \nTexas  sought  emergency  relief  from  this  Court, \nwhich stayed the district court’s orders invalidating the \n2013 redistricting plans.  Order, No. 17A225 (Sept. 12, \n2017); Order, No. 17A245 (Sept. 12, 2017).  Upon consid-\neration of Texas’s jurisdictional statements, this Court \nordered briefing and postponed further consideration of \nthe question of jurisdiction pending hearing of the case \non the merits.  Order, No. 17-586 (Jan. 12, 2018); Order, \nNo. 17-626 (Jan. 12, 2018).   \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nI.  This Court possesses jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n1253, which allows direct appeals to this Court from an \n\n7  The district court also invalidated HD90—a district newly drawn \nin  the  2013  State  House  plan—as  a  racial  gerrymander,  and  held \nthat HD32 and HD34 were unlawful for the additional reason that \nthey  violated  the  Section  2  results  test.    See  H.J.S.  App.  85a.    In \naddition, the court held that CD27 violated the Section 2 results test.  \nC.J.S. App. 112a; see also id. at 180a-195a.  The United States takes \nno position on those rulings.  The United States did not assert any \nresults claims in this litigation, and HD90 was revised in 2013 and \nthus does not involve the legislative adoption of a district provision-\nally  approved  by  the  district  court—the  principal  issue  addressed \nby the United States in this brief.  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f17 \n\norder  granting  or  denying  an  interlocutory  or  perma-\nnent injunction in three-judge district-court actions un-\nder  28 U.S.C.  2284(a) challenging  the  constitutionality \nof congressional districts or statewide legislative appor-\ntionments.  This Court has made clear in the analogous \ncontext  of  28  U.S.C.  1292(a)(1)  that  even  an  order  not \nstyled as the grant or denial of an injunction is appeal-\nable if it has the “practical effect” of granting or deny-\ning an injunction, “might have a ‘serious, perhaps irrep-\narable,  consequence,’ ”  and  “can  be  ‘effectually  chal-\nlenged’  only  by  immediate  appeal.”   Carson  v.  Ameri-\ncan Brands, Inc., 450 U.S. 79, 84 (1981).  Under the un-\nusual facts of this case, the district court’s orders meet \nthose standards.  The orders had the effect of prohibit-\ning  further  use  of  the  State’s  2013  congressional  and \nState House plans; they had the serious consequence of \nrequiring statewide redistricting on the eve of prepara-\ntions for the 2018 election cycle; and, under the timing \nexigencies present here, the orders could only be effec-\ntually challenged by immediate appeal. \n\nII.  The  district  court  committed  errors  of  law  in \nfinding  that  the  Texas  Legislature  engaged  in  inten-\ntional vote dilution in adopting Congressional District 27 \nand State House Districts 32, 34, 54, 55, 103, 104, and 105 \nin the 2013 plans, all of which were identical to districts \ncontained in the court’s own 2012 interim plans.   \n\nA. The  principles  for  adjudicating  claims  of  inten-\ntional  vote  dilution  are  well  established.    A  legislative \nenactment may be invalidated on that basis only if the \nplaintiffs show that the legislature acted with a discrim-\ninatory  purpose.    In  the  redistricting  context,  as  else-\nwhere, courts must accord a “presumption of good faith \n[to]  legislative  enactments.”    Hunt  v.  Cromartie,  526 \nU.S. 541, 553 (1999) (citation omitted).  Courts must not \n\n \n\f18 \n\ninfer discriminatory racial intent solely from disparate \nracial effects, and a finding of past intentional discrimi-\nnation  standing  alone  generally  cannot  support  an  in-\nference  of  intentional  discrimination  in  a  new  enact-\nment.  And when, as here, a State adopts legislatively a \nnew redistricting plan after a prior plan is held unlaw-\nful, the burden of proof rests on the plaintiff in any chal-\nlenge to the new plan.   \n\nThese principles also suggest a further principle:  A \ncourt should afford particular weight to a state legisla-\nture’s  reliance  on  a  court-ordered  remedy.    When  a \ncourt has found in a reasoned decision that an interim \nplan redresses all likely violations of law, and when the \nstate  legislature  permanently  adopts  that  plan  to  re-\nplace its original enactment, the normal presumption of \ngood faith accorded to legislative enactments is height-\nened by the State’s acceptance of the judicial plan.  Ap-\nplying a strong presumption of good faith in this context \nwould  not  direct  an  answer  to  the  intent  inquiry  as  a \nmatter of law, but plaintiffs should bear a heavy burden \nin  establishing  that  a  state  legislature’s  adoption  of  a \ncourt-ordered plan was intentionally discriminatory.   \nB. The  district  court  erred  in  its  analysis  of  inten-\ntional vote dilution.  Instead of asking whether plaintiffs \nhad proven that the 2013 Legislature adopted the 2013 \nplans with the purpose of harming minority voters, the \ncourt  asked  whether  the  State  had  shown  that  it  re-\nmoved  the  “taint  of  discriminatory  intent”  that  in  the \ncourt’s  view  had  “carr[ied]  over”  from  the  2011  plans.  \nC.J.S.  App.  38a,  46a.    But  the  lawfulness  of  the  2013 \nplans turns on the motivations of the 2013 Legislature, \nand plaintiffs—not the State—bore the burden of proof \nin that analysis.   \n\n \n\f19 \n\nC. The circumstances here confirm the soundness of \napplying a strong presumption of good faith.  The 2013 \nLegislature’s plans  were identical,  or nearly  so,  to  the \ncourt-ordered interim plans.  In adopting those interim \nplans  after extensive evidentiary proceedings,  the  dis-\ntrict  court expressly considered under  Perry  v.  Perez, \n565 U.S. 388 (2012) (per curiam), and provisionally re-\njected, claims of intentional discrimination involving the \nsame districts now at issue.  And the court made numer-\nous other ameliorative changes, which gave the Legis-\nlature  good  reason  to  believe  that  the  interim  plans \nwould suffice to remedy any prior deficiencies.   \n\nThe district court’s orders and plaintiffs’ jurisdictional-\nstage  filings  in  this  Court  do  not  point  to  evidence  that \nwould  rebut  the  strong  presumption  of  good  faith.    The \ncourt perceived that Texas was motivated to pursue a leg-\nislative solution as a “strategy” to end the pending liti-\ngation.    But  such  efforts  at  voluntary  compliance  pre-\nsumptively  further—not frustrate—Congress’s  goal  of \nameliorating  unlawful  discrimination.    And  the  court \nidentified no evidence showing that Texas acted with an \nintent to discriminate rather than an intent to adopt le-\ngally compliant plans.  \n\nIII. The district court also erred in finding Congres-\nsional District 35 to be an unconstitutional racial gerry-\nmander.    The  “predominant”  consideration  in  setting \nthe boundaries of CD35 in 2013 was not race, but rather \nwhether  they  matched  the  boundaries  provisionally \ndeemed  lawful  in  2012.    And  the  State  had  “good  rea-\nsons” to believe that the Voting Rights Act required it \nto draw CD35 in 2011 and maintain it in 2013, including \nthat  the  district  court  had  found  in  2012  that  CD35 \naided  in  complying  with  the  State’s  obligations  under \n\n \n\f20 \n\nthe VRA to draw seven Latino opportunity districts in \nSouth and West Texas. \n\nARGUMENT  \n\nI.  THIS  COURT  MAY  EXERCISE  JURISDICTION  OVER \n\nTHESE APPEALS \nA party may appeal directly to this Court “from an \norder  granting  or  denying    * * *    an  interlocutory  or \npermanent  injunction”  in  a  civil  action  required  to  be \nadjudicated by  a  three-judge district  court.    28  U.S.C. \n1253.    Under  28  U.S.C.  2284(a),  a  three-judge  district \ncourt is required for actions “challenging the constitu-\ntionality of the apportionment of congressional districts \nor the apportionment of any statewide legislative body.”  \nOrdinarily, when a district court has not entered an or-\nder granting or denying an injunction, this Court lacks \njurisdiction  to  enter  a  direct  appeal.    The  Court  has \nmade  clear  in  the  analogous  context  of  28  U.S.C. \n1292(a)(1), however, that even an order not styled as the \ngrant or denial of an injunction is appealable if it (1) has \nthe “practical effect” of granting or denying an injunc-\ntion;  (2)  “might  have  a  ‘serious,  perhaps  irreparable, \nconsequence’ ”;  and  (3) “can  be  ‘effectually  challenged’ \nonly  by  immediate  appeal.”    Carson  v.  American \nBrands,  Inc.,  450  U.S.  79,  84  (1981);  see  Gulfstream \nAerospace  Corp.  v.  Mayacamas  Corp.,  485  U.S.  271, \n287-288  (1988).    In  the  circumstances  presented  here, \nthe district court’s August 15 and 24 orders meet those \nstandards. \n\nA. This case presents an unusual combination of ex-\ntraordinary delays in the judicial proceedings followed \nby  the  equally  extraordinary  expedition  of  those  pro-\nceedings  on  the  eve  of  preparations  for  the  upcoming \nelection  cycle.    After  Texas  enacted  the  2013 congres-\nsional  and  State  House  plans,  plaintiffs  promptly \n\n \n\f21 \n\namended  their  complaints  to  challenge  them.    But  the \ntrial on the 2013 plans was not held until July 2017, and \nthe  district  court  did  not  issue  its  decisions  on  those \nplans  until  mid-August  2017,  even  though  Texas  had \npreviously informed the district court that its deadlines \nto  begin  preparations  for  the  2018  election  cycle  re-\nquired that its plans be in place no later than October 1, \n2017.    See  D. Ct.  Doc.  1388,  at  1-2  (May  1, 2017).8    By \nthe time the district court finally ruled, the 2013 plans \n(or  the  2012  court-ordered  plans  on  which  they  were \nbased) had been used for three straight election cycles \n(2012, 2014, and 2016).   \n\nThe district court’s August 15 and August 24 orders \nheld that the 2013 plans were unlawful and made clear \nthat  those  plans  would  not  be  used  for  the  upcoming \n2018 elections.  The court’s orders found that the 2013 \ncongressional and State House plans contained various \n“statutory and constitutional violations” and stated that \nthose violations “must be remedied by either the Texas \nLegislature  or  this  Court.”    C.J.S.  App.  118a;  H.J.S. \nApp.  84a-85a  (similar).    The  court  then  directed  the \nTexas  Attorney  General  to  advise,  within  only  “three \nbusiness  days,”  whether  “the  Legislature  intends  to \n\n8  Texas advised the district court that pursuant to Texas Election \nCode § 14.001 (West 2017), election officials were required to mail \nvoter election certificates on or after November 15, 2017, but before \nDecember 6, 2017.  See D. Ct. Doc. 1388, at 2.  The State indicated \nthat  October  1,  2017  was  “the  last  possible  date  when  individual \nvoter-registration-templates must be provided by the Secretary of \nState  to  each  of  the  254  county  election  officials  in  the  State  of \nTexas.”  Id. at 1-2.  The State’s primary elections are scheduled for \nMarch 6, 2018.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f22 \n\ntake  up  redistricting  in  an  effort  to  cure  these  viola-\ntions.”    C.J.S.  App.  118a; H.J.S.  App.  86a.9    The  court \nfurther  directed  that  “[i]f  the  Legislature  does  not  in-\ntend  to  take  up  redistricting,”  the  court  would  hold \n“hearing[s] to consider remedial plans” on September 5 \nand 6, 2017.  Ibid.  The court ordered that, in that event, \n“the parties must take immediate steps to consult with \ntheir  experts  and  mapdrawers  and  prepare  statewide  \n* * *  plans that remedy the violations.”  Ibid. \n\nIn  these  circumstances,  the  district  court’s  orders \nwere tantamount to injunctive relief.  The court’s signif-\nicant delay,  coupled  with  the impending  deadlines  and \nthe  remarkably  compressed  time  frame  to  consider  a \npossible  legislative  enactment,  placed  Texas  in  a  diffi-\ncult position:  because the district court found the exist-\ning  plans  “unlawful”  and  ordered  that  they  “must  be \nremedied,” Texas could be quite confident that the dis-\ntrict court would not permit it to use those plans for the \n2018  elections,  even  though  the  court  had  approved \ntheir use in prior years.  Yet that consequence was not \nexpressly  stated  in  the  form  of  an  injunction.    Had \nTexas been required to wait until the district court en-\ntered  an  express  injunction,  it  would  likely  have  come \ntoo late to afford Texas a reasonable opportunity under \n\n9  That three-day response period was far shorter than is typically \nafforded  to  a  state  legislature,  which  this  Court has  stated  should \nbe given a “reasonable opportunity” to contemplate a possible leg-\nislative remedy before being compelled to proceed to remedial liti-\ngation.  Lawyer v. Department of Justice, 521 U.S. 567, 576 (1997) \n(quoting Wise v. Lipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978) (principal opin-\nion)). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f23 \n\nthe circumstances for appellate review before deadlines \nassociated with the 2018 election cycle.10 \n\nB. None of this Court’s decisions compels a different \nresult.    In  Gunn  v.  University  Committee  to  End  the \nWar in Viet Nam, 399 U.S. 383 (1970), this Court held \nthat  it  lacked  jurisdiction  under  Section  1253  over  a \nthree-judge  district-court  order  that  declared  a  state \nlaw  unconstitutional, but  declined  to  enter an  immedi-\nate  injunction.    That  case,  however,    did  not  involve  a \nredistricting suit under 28 U.S.C. 2284(a) or the timing \nconsiderations present here, and it cannot be said that \nthe  district  court’s  liability  determination  in  that  case \ncould  only  be  effectually  challenged  by  immediate  ap-\npeal.    Similarly,  in  Whitcomb  v.  Chavis,  403  U.S.  124 \n(1971), this Court held in a footnote that it lacked juris-\ndiction under Section 1253 to entertain an appeal from \nan  interlocutory  liability determination in  a redistrict-\ning  case.   Id.  at  138  n.19;  see  Whitcomb  v.  Davis,  403 \nU.S.  914  (1971)  (order  dismissing  appeal).    But  that \ncase, too, did not involve the timing pressures present \nhere, and the Court did not expressly consider whether \nthe  district  court’s  liability  ruling  may  have  had  the \npractical effect of an injunction.  \n\n10  We do not suggest that such preliminary deadlines in the elec-\ntion cycle should stand as an obstacle to relief on the merits if the \nCourt were to find a violation of the VRA or the Constitution and if \nthe  considerations  identified  in  Purcell  v.  Gonzalez,  549  U.S.  1 \n(2006)  (per  curiam),  for  withholding  relief  close  to  an  election  are \nnot yet present.  As explained in the text, however, the delays and \nresulting compressed time frame are relevant for purposes of con-\nstruing 28 U.S.C. 1253 and 2284(a), which provide for direct review \nof  injunctions  against  statewide  reapportionment  plans  to  ensure \nprompt resolution of challenges to such plans and to accord respect \nfor acts of a state legislature.   \n\n \n                                                      \n\f24 \n\nII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  ITS  ANALYSIS  OF \nINTENTIONAL  VOTE  DILUTION  IN  THE  2013  CON-\nGRESSIONAL AND STATE HOUSE PLANS  \nOn the merits, the Court should correct the legal er-\nrors  underlying  the  district  court’s  rulings  that  the \nTexas Legislature engaged in intentional vote dilution in \n2013  when  it  adopted  Congressional  District  27,  and \nState  House  Districts  32,  34,  54,  55,  103,  104,  and  105, \nwithout change from the court’s own 2012 interim plans.  \nThe  court  rested its  rulings  on  determinations  that  the \nState’s  original  2011  plans  were  tainted  with  “discrimi-\nnatory  intent”  and  that  the  Legislature  failed  to \n“cleanse”  that  intent  in  enacting  its  new  2013  plans.  \nC.J.S. App. 44a.  But in deciding whether the 2013 plans \nwere intentionally discriminatory, the court should have \nevaluated the intent of the 2013 Legislature, and should \nhave  applied  the  familiar  principles  for  discerning  the \nintent of a legislative body, which include a presumption \nof good faith.  That presumption should be particularly \nstrong  here,  because  the  Legislature  enacted  the  in-\nterim plans adopted by the district court.  Viewed under \nthe  correct  legal  framework,  the  evidence  invoked  by \nthe  district  court,  and  discussed  by  plaintiffs  in  their \nmotions to dismiss or affirm in this Court, would not be \nsufficient to overcome that strong presumption of good \nfaith and to establish discriminatory intent.   \n\nA.  Plaintiffs’ Claims Of Intentional Vote Dilution Require \nThem To Show That The 2013 Legislature Acted With A \nDiscriminatory Racial Purpose  \n\nPlaintiffs claim that the 2013 plans (Plans C235 and \nH358)  intentionally  diluted  the  voting  strength  of  mi-\nnority voters in several districts in violation of Section \n2  of  the  VRA  and  the  Fourteenth  Amendment.    The \n\n \n\f25 \n\nprinciples for adjudicating those claims are well estab-\nlished.   \n\n1.  A  legislative  enactment  may  be  invalidated  on \ngrounds of intentional discrimination only if the legisla-\nture  “acted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose.”    Reno  v. \nBossier Parish Sch. Bd., 520 U.S. 471, 481 (1997).  “ ‘Dis-\ncriminatory purpose’  * * *  implies more than intent as \nvolition or intent as awareness of consequences.  It im-\nplies  that  the  decisionmaker  selected  or  reaffirmed  a \nparticular course of action at least in part ‘because of,’ \nnot merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects upon an iden-\ntifiable  group.”    Personnel  Adm’r  v.  Feeney,  442  U.S. \n256, 279 (1979) (citation omitted).  Thus, “even if a neu-\ntral law has a disproportionately adverse effect upon a \nracial  minority,  it  is  unconstitutional  under  the  Equal \nProtection Clause only if that impact can be traced to a \ndiscriminatory purpose.”  Id. at 272.   \n\nThe inquiry into a legislature’s motivation is an “in-\nherently  complex  endeavor.”    Hunt  v.  Cromartie,  526 \nU.S. 541, 546 (1999).  “Outright admissions of impermis-\nsible racial motivation are infrequent.”  Id. at 553.  More \ncommonly,  “[d]etermining  whether  invidious  discrimi-\nnatory purpose was a motivating factor demands a sen-\nsitive  inquiry  into  such  circumstantial  and  direct  evi-\ndence of intent as may be available.”  Village of Arling-\nton Heights v. Metropolitan Hous. Dev. Corp., 429 U.S. \n252, 266 (1977); see Rogers v. Lodge, 458 U.S. 613, 618 \n(1982)  (recognizing  that  “an  invidious  discriminatory \npurpose” may often be “inferred from the totality of the \nrelevant facts”) (quoting Washington v. Davis, 426 U.S. \n229,  242  (1976)).    The  determination  of  a  legislature’s \nmotivation,  though  guided  by  legal  principles,  is  ulti-\nmately an issue of fact.  See Hunt, 526 U.S. at 549 (“The \nlegislature’s motivation is itself a factual question.”).   \n\n \n\f26 \n\nIn  Arlington  Heights,  this  Court  set  forth  several \nconsiderations in analyzing “whether invidious discrim-\ninatory  purpose  was  a  motivating  factor”  in  a  govern-\nment body’s decisionmaking.  429 U.S. at 266; see Boss-\nier  Parish,  520  U.S.  at  481  (noting  that  Arlington \nHeights “serve[s] as the framework for examining dis-\ncriminatory purpose in cases brought under the Equal \nProtection Clause”).  Under this framework, courts con-\nsider (1) whether the “impact of the official action  * * *  \nbears more heavily on one race than another”; (2) “the \nhistorical background of the decision”; (3) “[t]he specific \nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  challenged  deci-\nsion”; (4) any “[d]epartures from the normal procedural \nsequence”;  and  (5)  “[t]he  legislative  or  administrative \nhistory, especially  . . .  [any] contemporary statements \nby members of the decisionmaking body.”  Bossier Par-\nish,  520  U.S.  at  489  (quoting  Arlington  Heights,  429 \nU.S. at 266-268) (brackets in original).  This Court has \nrepeatedly applied this framework to assess legislative \nintent in the context of challenges to state redistricting \nplans.  See Hunt, 526 U.S. at 546-549; Shaw v. Reno, 509 \nU.S. 630, 644 (1993) (Shaw I); Rogers, 458 U.S. at 618.   \nIn performing this inquiry, the burden rests on the \n“plaintiff ” to “establish that the State  * * *  acted with \na discriminatory purpose.”  Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. at \n481; cf. Schaffer v. Weast, 546 U.S. 49, 56 (2005) (recog-\nnizing  that  the  burden  of  proof  generally  rests  on  the \nparty  alleging  a  violation  of  federal  law); Voinovich  v. \nQuilter,  507  U.S.  146, 155-156  (1993)  (“Section  2, how-\never, places at least the initial burden of proving an ap-\nportionment’s  invalidity  squarely  on  the  plaintiff ’s \nshoulders.”).    If,  and  only  if,  a  plaintiff  proves  inten-\ntional  discrimination  does  the  burden  shift  to  the  de-\nfendant  to  establish  any  available  defense,  such  as  by \n\n \n\f27 \n\nshowing  that  it  would  have  taken  the  same  action  for \nvalid reasons even absent impermissible discrimination.  \nSee Mt. Healthy City Sch. Dist. Bd. of Educ. v. Doyle, \n429 U.S. 274, 285-286 (1977). \n\n2.  The Court has recognized several additional prin-\nciples relevant to adjudicating claims of unlawful racial \nintent in the context of state legislative redistricting.   \n\nFirst, this Court has emphasized in the redistricting \ncontext that courts must accord a “presumption of good \nfaith [to] legislative enactments.”  Hunt, 526 U.S. at 553 \n(quoting  Miller  v.  Johnson,  515  U.S.  900,  916  (1995)).  \nThe Court has explained that “[f ]ederal-court review of \ndistricting legislation represents a serious intrusion on \nthe most vital of local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 915, \nbecause  legislative  apportionment  is  “primarily  the \nduty and responsibility of the State,” Shelby County v. \nHolder, 133 S. Ct. 2612, 2623 (2013) (quoting Perry v. Pe-\nrez, 565 U.S. 388, 392 (2012)) (per curiam); see Cooper v. \nHarris,  137  S. Ct.  1455,  1463  (2017)  (“The  Constitution \nentrusts  States  with  the  job  of designing  congressional \ndistricts.”).  For that reason, “courts must ‘exercise ex-\ntraordinary  caution  in  adjudicating  claims  that  a  State \nhas drawn district lines on the basis of race.’ ”  Bethune-\nHill v. Virginia State Bd. of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 797 \n(2017) (quoting Miller, 515 U.S. at 916). \n\nSecond,  this  Court  has  explained  that,  although  in-\nquiry into the effects of a challenged action “may pro-\nvide an important starting point” for analysis, “official \naction will not be held unconstitutional solely because it \nresults in a racially disproportionate impact.”  Arling-\nton Heights, 429 U.S. at 264-266 (citing Davis, 426 U.S. \nat 242); see also, e.g., Coleman v. Court of Appeals, 566 \nU.S.  30,  42  (2012)  (plurality  opinion).    Thus,  a  State’s \n\n \n \n\f28 \n\ndecision to “choose a redistricting plan that has a dilu-\ntive impact does not, without more, suffice to establish \nthat  the  jurisdiction  acted  with  a  discriminatory  pur-\npose.”  Bossier Parish, 520 U.S. at 487-488; cf. Miller, \n515 U.S.  at  914  (stating  in  racial-gerrymandering  con-\ntext  that “impact  alone” is  usually “not determinative, \nand the Court must look to other evidence of race-based \ndecisionmaking”). \n\nThird, this Court has recognized that a finding of in-\ntentional discrimination in a prior legislative enactment \nis ordinarily insufficient, standing alone, to support an \ninference of intentional discrimination in a later enact-\nment.   “[P]ast discrimination cannot, in  the manner  of \noriginal sin, condemn governmental action that is not it-\nself unlawful.”  City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 74 \n(1980)  (plurality  opinion).    Of  course,  “[t]he  historical \nbackground”  to  a  challenged  enactment  is  a  relevant \nconsideration,  Arlington  Heights,  429  U.S.  at  267,  in-\ncluding evidence pertaining to events that are “reason-\nably  contemporaneous  with  the  challenged  decision,” \nMcCleskey v. Kemp, 481 U.S. 279, 298 n.20 (1987).  But \neven when a prior finding of intentional discrimination \nwas  recent,  “[t]he  ultimate  question”  under  Arlington \nHeights  must be  “whether  a discriminatory intent  has \nbeen proved in [the] given case”—that is, for the partic-\nular challenged enactment.  City of Mobile, 446 U.S. at \n74 (plurality opinion).  \n\nFourth, this Court’s decisions indicate that, when a \nState  enacts  a  new  redistricting  plan  in  response  to  a \njudicial order holding a prior plan unconstitutional, the \nplaintiff retains the burden of proof in any challenge to \nthe  State’s  new  plan.    This  Court  has  long  recognized \nthat when a federal court has determined that a new ap-\nportionment  is  required,  a  State  “should  be  given  the \n\n \n\f29 \n\nopportunity  to  make  its  own  redistricting  decisions  so \nlong as that is practically possible.”  Lawyer v. Depart-\nment  of  Justice,  521  U.S.  567,  576  (1997);  see  Wise  v. \nLipscomb, 437 U.S. 535, 540 (1978) (principal opinion).  \nAnd even when practical necessities dictate the imple-\nmentation  of  a  court-drawn  map  in  the  first  instance, \nStates  nonetheless  remain  “free  to  replace  court- \nmandated  remedial  plans  by  enacting  redistricting \nplans of their own.”  League of United Latin Am. Citi-\nzens v. Perry, 548 U.S. 399, 416 (2006) (LULAC) (opin-\nion of Kennedy, J.); see Wise, 437 U.S. at 540 (principal \nopinion);  Burns  v.  Richardson,  384  U.S.  73,  85  (1966).  \nWhen  a  State  avails  itself  of  that  opportunity,  “[t]he \nnew  legislative  plan    * * *    will  then  be  the  governing \nlaw unless it, too, is challenged and found to violate the \nConstitution.”  Wise, 437 U.S. at 540 (principal opinion);  \naccord id. at 548 (opinion of Powell, J., joined by three \nother Justices concurring in part and concurring in the \njudgment); id. at 550 (Marshall, J., dissenting, joined by \ntwo other Justices) (agreeing with the relevant portion \nof  the  principal  opinion);  see  also  Mississippi  State \nChapter, Operation PUSH, Inc. v. Mabus, 932 F.2d 400, \n408-409 (5th Cir. 1991) (holding that plaintiff had failed \nto “establish[] that the Mississippi Legislature” had “a \nracially discriminatory purpose” in enacting its legisla-\ntive remedy for a Section 2 violation).   \n\n3.  The foregoing principles, taken together, suggest \na further principle.  In considering the “historical back-\nground”  and  “specific  sequence  of  events”  leading  to  a \nrevised legislative action, Arlington Heights, 429 U.S. at \n267, a court should afford particular weight to a state leg-\nislature’s reliance on a court’s determination that a par-\nticular remedy is both necessary and likely sufficient to \ncure a legal violation.  When, as here, a court has found \n\n \n \n\f30 \n\nthat an interim plan is sufficient to redress all likely vio-\nlations  of  law,  and  when  the  state  legislature  perma-\nnently adopts that plan to replace its original enactment, \nthe normal presumption of good faith accorded to legis-\nlative  enactments  is  heightened  by  the  State’s  ac-\nceptance of the judicial plan.  Courts should operate from \na  strong  presumption  that  the  state  legislature’s  adop-\ntion of the judicially approved remedy was due to good-\nfaith compliance efforts rather than sinister motives.  \n  Applying a strong presumption of good faith in this \ncontext would not direct an answer to the intent inquiry \nas a matter of law.  Even when a state legislature per-\nmanently adopts a remedy that a court has provisionally \ndeclared to be lawful, a plaintiff may attempt to prove \nthat  the  legislature  adopted  that  remedy  not  in  good \nfaith, but rather for the purpose of harming racial mi-\nnorities and perpetuating unlawful discrimination.  Cf. \nHayden  v.  Paterson,  594  F.3d  150,  167  (2d  Cir.  2010) \n(contemplating  the  “possibility  that  a  legislative  body \nmight  seek  to  insulate  from  challenge  a  law  known  to \nhave been originally enacted with a discriminatory pur-\npose”).    The  legislature’s  adoption  of  a  court-ordered \nplan cannot immunize a State from all possible liability, \nincluding for intentional wrongdoing when it exists.  Cf., \ne.g.,  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  416  (opinion  of  Kennedy,  J.) \n(“Judicial respect for legislative plans  * * *  cannot jus-\ntify legislative reliance on improper criteria for district-\ning  determinations.”);  Weinberger  v.  Wiesenfeld,  420 \nU.S. 636, 648 n.16 (1975) (recognizing that courts “need \nnot  * * *  accept at face value assertions of legislative \npurposes” if “examination of the legislative scheme and \nits  history  demonstrates  that  the  asserted  purpose \ncould not have been a goal of the legislation”).  Plaintiffs \nshould  bear  a  heavy  burden,  however,  in  establishing \n\n \n\f31 \n\nthat  a  state  legislature’s  adoption  of  a  court-ordered \nplan was intentionally discriminatory. \n\nB.  The  District  Court  Incorrectly  Presumed  Discrimina-\ntory  Intent  And  Shifted  The  Burden  Of  Proof  To  The \nState \n\nRather  than  applying the settled framework  for in-\ntentional vote-dilution claims, the district court under-\ntook a fundamentally different analysis.  The court did \nnot ask whether plaintiffs had proven that the Legisla-\nture, in enacting the 2013 plans, acted with the purpose \nof  harming  minority  voters.    Instead,  the  court  asked \nwhether  the  State  had  shown  that  it  had  removed  the \n“taint of discriminatory intent” associated with certain \ndistricts in its 2011 plans.  C.J.S. App. 38a.11  The court’s \nanalysis reflects several legal errors. \n\n1.  First, the district court incorrectly assumed that \ndiscriminatory  intent  associated  with  old  legislation \npersists  into  new  litigation  unless  that  prior  intent  is \nconfronted and somehow affirmatively extirpated.  The \ncourt faulted the Legislature for not undertaking a “de-\nliberative  process  to  ensure  that  the  2013  plans  cured \nany  taint  from  the  2011  plans.”    C.J.S.  App.  40a.    The \ncourt  concluded  that,  in  light  of  that  failure,  “the  ra-\ncially  discriminatory  intent    * * *    that  it  previously \nfound  in  the  2011  plans  carr[ied]  over  into  the  2013 \nplans where those district lines remain unchanged.”  Id. \n\n11  The district court briefly recited the Arlington Heights frame-\nwork in the background of its opinion, see C.J.S. App. 27a, but its \nanalysis did not follow that framework.  The sole arguable applica-\ntion of Arlington Heights appeared in a footnote, in which the dis-\ntrict  court  observed  that  the  “history  of  discrimination”  in  Texas \n“support[ed]”  the  court’s  findings  under  its  taint  analysis.    Id.  at \n38a-39a n.27.  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f32 \n\nat 46a; see id. at 117a (same); H.J.S. App. 6a (incorpo-\nrating same analysis).   \n\nThat  presumption  of  persistent  discriminatory  in-\ntent  is  inconsistent  with  the  analysis  required  by  this \nCourt’s decisions.  See pp. 26-30, supra.  It also makes \nlittle sense.  Whether intentional discrimination existed \nin  enacting  the  2013  redistricting  plans  is  a  question \nabout the motives of the 2013 Legislature.  Although un-\nder  Arlington  Heights  as  applied  in  the  redistricting \ncontext,  a  history  of  prior  discrimination by  a state  or \nlocal  legislative  body  can  be  relevant,  the  central  in-\nquiry is whether the legislature that enacted the partic-\nular law at issue did so for an impermissible purpose. 12  \nLegislative intent is not an artifact that “carr[ies] over” \nfrom one law to the next; it must be decided anew with \neach  successive  enactment.    See,  e.g.,  City  of  Mobile, \n446 U.S. at 74 (plurality opinion) (inquiring “whether a \n\n12  In its jurisdictional statement, Texas appears to contend (C.J.S. \n25-28) that the district court impermissibly relied on factual findings \nabout  the  2011  Legislature’s  intent  because claims concerning  the \n2011 plans were moot.  Regardless of whether the claims concerning \nthe 2011 plans were moot, the district court was not foreclosed, un-\nder  the  Arlington  Heights  analysis  in  this  redistricting  context, \nfrom  considering  the  “historical  background  of ”  and  “sequence  of \nevents leading up to” enactment of the 2013 redistricting plans, in-\ncluding whether the 2011 Legislature acted with discriminatory in-\ntent.    But  the  pertinent  question  is  whether  the  2013  plans  were \nunlawful,  and  those  plans  are  entitled  to  a  strong  presumption  of \nvalidity because the Texas Legislature enacted the court’s own in-\nterim plans with little or no change.  As explained below, evidence \nconcerning  the  2011  plans  alone  is  not  sufficient  to  overcome  that \npresumption and establish impermissible intent on the part of the \n2013 Legislature, and neither the district court nor plaintiffs in their \nmotions to dismiss or affirm have identified other evidence that does \nso.  See pp. 40-44, infra. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f33 \n\ndiscriminatory intent has been proved” as to the partic-\nular  enactment  at  issue,  because  “past  discrimination \ncannot  * * *  condemn governmental action that is not \nitself unlawful”); cf. Palmer v. Thompson, 403 U.S. 217, \n225  (1971)  (contemplating  that  a  law  invalidated  be-\ncause of improper motive might “be valid” if the legisla-\nture “repassed it for different reasons”). \n\nIn support of its belief that the discriminatory intent \nfrom 2011 “carr[ied] over” into 2013, the district court \ninvoked this Court’s decision in Hunter v. Underwood, \n471 U.S. 222 (1985).  See C.J.S. App. 35a (“With regard \nto  those  areas  in  Plan  C185  and  Plan  H283  where  the \nCourt  found  that  [the]  district  lines  were  drawn  with \nimpermissible  motive    * * *    ,  Hunter  indicates  that \nthose  portions  of  the  plans  remain  unlawful.”).    But \nHunter did  not involve  a subsequent  legislative  enact-\nment  at  all.    Rather,  the  question  was  whether  a  1901 \nprovision of the Alabama Constitution, which provided \nfor  the  disenfranchisement  of  persons  “convicted  of, \namong other offenses, ‘any crime  . . .  involving moral \nturpitude,’ ”  was  invalid  because  it  had  been  adopted \nwith the purpose of disenfranchising black voters.  471 \nU.S.  at  223.   In defending the  constitutionality  of that \nprovision, Alabama urged that the passage of time, cou-\npled  with  intervening  judicial  rulings  narrowing  the \npredicate crimes giving rise to disenfranchisement, had \nvitiated any intentional discrimination.   \n\nThis Court rejected that proposition, explaining that \nthe prior judicial invalidation of “[s]ome of the more bla-\ntantly  discriminatory  selections”  of  crimes  (including \n“miscegenation”) did not cure the intentional discrimi-\nnation  motivating  other  then-surviving  provisions.  \nHunter,  471 U.S.  at  233.    But  Hunter  specifically  con-\ntemplated  that  a  different  analysis  would  apply  if  the \n\n \n\f34 \n\nchallenged  provisions  had  been  reenacted  at  a  later \ntime, and reserved the question whether the challenged \nprovision “would be valid if enacted today without any \nimpermissible motivation.”  Ibid.; see City of Cleburne \nv.  Cleburne  Living  Ctr.,  473  U.S.  432,  465  n.17  (1985) \n(Marshall,  J.,  concurring  in  the  judgment  in  part  and \ndissenting  in  part)  (describing  Hunter  as  “h[olding] \nthat  extant  laws  originally  motivated  by  a  discrimina-\ntory  purpose  continue  to  violate  the  Equal  Protection \nClause,  even  if  they  would  be  permissible  were  they \nreenacted without a discriminatory motive”); Cotton v. \nFordice,  157  F.3d  388,  391 (5th  Cir.  1998)  (noting  that \nHunter “left open the possibility that by amendment, a \nfacially neutral provision  * * *  might overcome its odi-\nous origin”).   \n\nConsistent with that understanding of Hunter, sev-\neral  courts  of  appeals  have  recognized  that,  when  a \nState reenacts a particular voting provision that was in-\ntentionally  discriminatory  when  first  enacted,  the  ulti-\nmate focus in any subsequent litigation must be the in-\ntent  of  the  reenacting  legislature,  not  the  original  one.  \nSee  Hayden,  594  F.3d  at  166-167  (addressing  felon- \ndisenfranchisement law); Johnson v. Governor, 405 F.3d \n1214,  1223-1224  (11th  Cir.)  (en  banc)  (same),  cert.  de-\nnied, 546 U.S. 1015 (2005); Cotton, 157 F.3d at 391-392 \n&  n.7  (same);  Chen  v.  City  of  Houston,  206  F.3d  502, \n520-521  (5th  Cir.  2000)  (addressing  racial-gerryman-\ndering claim), cert. denied, 532 U.S. 1046 (2001).  Those \ncourts also have rejected the proposition that prior in-\ntent “remains legally operative” unless and until some \naffirmative  contrary  showing  is  made.    Johnson,  405 \nF.3d at 1223; see Hayden, 594 F.3d at 166-167 (quoting \nand  citing  Johnson  with  approval);  accord Cotton,  157 \nF.3d  at  392  (reaffirming  that  plaintiff  was  required  to \n\n \n\f35 \n\nshow that the “current version” of the law was “adopted \nout of a desire to discriminate”) (emphasis added). 13  \n\n13  The district court declared that the “most relevant case” sup-\nporting  its  analysis  was  Chen  v.  City  of  Houston,  supra,  but  that \ndecision is fully consistent with the above-stated principles.  C.J.S. \nApp. 35a; cf. id. at 35a-39a.  In Chen, the plaintiffs alleged that the \nCity’s  1997  districting  plan  was  a  racial  gerrymander  insofar  as  it \n“substantially maintained the borders of previous plans” from 1991, \n1993, and 1995 in which race had allegedly predominated.  206 F.3d \nat 513.  The Fifth Circuit explained that, although “evidence of in-\ntent garnered from [those] prior plans” was relevant, “the state of \nmind involved in the prior plans [was] not of itself what is precisely \nand directly the ultimate issue before the [c]ourt in this case.”  Id. \nat 521.  Rather, the court recognized that the “state of mind of the \nreenacting  body” controls  the  analysis,  and  observed that  the  “in-\ntervening reenactment with meaningful alterations may render the \ncurrent law valid” even if the prior law was unconstitutional.  Ibid.  \nThe court also applied a “presumption in favor of the Council’s good \nfaith,” id. at 520, and ultimately found that race had not predomi-\nnated either in 1997 or in the prior years at issue. \n\nThe district court also invoked Kirksey v. Board of Supervisors, \n554 F.2d 139 (5th Cir.) (en banc), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 968 (1977), \nwhich reasoned that the “benign nature” of a new redistricting plan \n“cannot insulate the redistricting government entity from the exist-\ning taint” of a prior “intentional and purposeful discriminatory de-\nnial  of  access.”   Id.  at  146-147;  see  C.J.S.  App.  33a n.34,  45a.   But \nKirksey  dates  from  the  pre-City  of  Mobile  era  in  which  the  Fifth \nCircuit had concluded that a constitutional vote-dilution claim could \nbe  proven  by  either  discriminatory  purpose  or  discriminatory  ef-\nfects.  Cf. Jones v. City of Lubbock, 727 F.2d 364, 369, 377-378 (5th \nCir. 1984) (describing history).  And to the extent “th[e] [Kirksey] \ncourt determined that a [constitutional] voting dilution case did not \nnecessarily  require  intent  where  a  political  system  demonstrably \ncontinued the effects of historical discrimination,” the Fifth Circuit \nlater rejected that approach, recognizing that a constitutional vote-\ndilution claim must “satisfy the purpose standard generally applica-\nble in equal protection cases.”  Id. at 377.   \n\n \n                                                      \n \n \n\f36 \n\n2.  In imposing a legal obligation on the Legislature \nto “ensure that the 2013 plans cured any taint from the \n2011 plans,” C.J.S. App. 40a, the district court also ef-\nfectively  shifted  the  burden  of  proof  to  Texas.    As  ex-\nplained  above,  the  burden  rests  on  the  “plaintiff [s]”  \nto “establish that the State  * * *  acted with a discrim-\ninatory  purpose.”    Bossier  Parish,  520  U.S.  at  481.   \nAlthough  the  court  did  not  expressly  state  that  it  was \nshifting the burden of proof, its conclusions that “[t]he \ndiscriminatory  taint  was  not  removed  by  the  Legisla-\nture’s  enactment  of  the  Court’s  interim  plans,”  C.J.S. \nApp.  46a  (emphasis  added),  and  that  “the  Legislature \ndid not engage in a deliberative process to ensure that \nthe 2013 plans cured any taint from the 2011 plans,” id. \nat 40a (emphasis added), rest on the evident assumption \nthat it was the State’s obligation to disprove discrimina-\ntory  intent  in  2013 rather  than plaintiffs’  obligation  to \nprove  it.14    In  shifting  that  burden,  the  district  court \noverrode  the  strong  “presumption  of  good  faith”  that \nthe State’s enactments should have enjoyed in these cir-\ncumstances.  Miller, 515 U.S. at 916; see p. 27, supra.   \nThe district court suggested that, absent a burden on \nTexas to show it has “removed” its prior bad intent, the \n2013  plans  would  be  “insulate[d]”  from  challenge  and \nplaintiffs would have “no remedy” for any “discrimina-\ntion  or  unconstitutional  effects” in  those  plans.   C.J.S. \nApp. 44a-45a & n.45.  That is incorrect:  plaintiffs here \ncould  have  attempted  to  prove  their  case  in  the  same \n\n14  The district court’s burden-shifting was invited by some plain-\ntiffs, who argued that the “State has the burden [in the litigation] to \nprove that its chosen remedy cures all of the defects found by the \nCourt”  in  the  2011  plan.    D. Ct.  Doc.  1525,  at  49  (July  31,  2017) \n(MALC post-trial brief ); see id. at 21, 40-42. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f37 \n\nway  as  all  other  similarly  situated  plaintiffs  in  redis-\ntricting  cases—namely,  by  establishing  that  the  2013 \nLegislature  enacted  the  2013  plans  for  impermissible \nracial  purposes.    And  to  do  that,  because  the  Legisla-\nture  adopted  court-ordered  remedial  plans,  plaintiffs \nshould  be  required  to  adduce  particularly  persuasive \nevidence in order to surmount the presumption that the \nLegislature  acted  lawfully.    But  the  possibility  that  a \nlegislature might act with nefarious motives in enacting \na court-approved plan cannot justify relieving plaintiffs \nof their burden to show that those motives exist.15 \n\nC.  This  Court  Should  Reject  The  Basis  For  The  District \n\nCourt’s Findings Of Intentional Discrimination \n\nIt  was  only  by  relying  on  the  flawed  premises  de-\nscribed above that the district court reached its conclu-\nsion  that  the  2013  plans  were  the  unlawful  product  of \nintentional discrimination.  Although the determination \nof  legislative  motive  is  a  “factual  question,” Hunt,  526 \nU.S. at 549, this Court retains “full power to correct a \ncourt’s errors of law,” including any “legal mistake[s]” \nunderlying factual findings.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464-\n1465,  1474;  see  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  427  (“Where  ‘the \nultimate finding of dilution’ is based on ‘a misreading of \nthe  governing  law’    * * *    there  is  reversible  error.”) \n\n15  The district court’s “insulat[ion]” concern also reflects its con-\nflation of the concepts of discriminatory intent and unlawful vote-\ndilutive  effect.    Although  success  on  plaintiffs’  intentional  vote- \ndilution claims would require proof that the 2013 Legislature acted \nfor a discriminatory purpose, plaintiffs’ Section 2 “results” claims \nrequire no such showing.  See pp. 4-5, supra.  Thus, as Texas has \nacknowledged, the fact that a re-enacting legislature does not act \nwith unlawful intent does not foreclose the possibility that “imper-\nmissible discriminatory effect may be carried over  * * *  from one \nversion of a law to another.”  C.J.S. 17.  \n\n \n                                                      \n\f38 \n\n(quoting  Johnson  v.  De  Grandy,  512  U.S.  997,  1022 \n(1994)).  This Court should correct those legal errors.   \n\n1.   Application  of  a strong  presumption  of  good  faith is \n\nappropriate in this case \n\nThe  circumstances  of  this  case  confirm  the  sound-\nness of applying a strong presumption that the Legisla-\nture did not act with an impermissible racial purpose in \nadopting the 2013 redistricting plans.   \n\nFirst, the 2013 Legislature enacted plans that were \neither  identical  (for  the  congressional  plan)  or  nearly \nidentical (for the State House plan) to the interim plans \nthat  the district court  ordered  to be used  for  the  2012 \nelections.  A legislature’s adoption, entirely or substan-\ntially  without  amendment,  of  plans  that  have  received \njudicial approval indicates the legislature’s reliance on \nthe district court’s factual and legal determinations that \nthose plans are likely lawful.  \n\nSecond, in approving the 2012 interim plans, the dis-\ntrict court expressly considered each of plaintiffs’ chal-\nlenges under this Court’s Perry decision and concluded \nthat they either were “insubstantial” or had no “likeli-\nhood of success.”  Perry, 565 U.S. at 394-395.  The three-\njudge district court’s approval of the districts that were \nunchanged from the 2011 plan to the 2012 interim plan \nwas based on extensive evidentiary proceedings, includ-\ning a ten-day trial in 2011; a three-day hearing in 2011 \nregarding the first set of interim maps; a two-day hear-\ning in 2012 concerning the revised set of interim maps \non remand from Perry; and the court’s review of post-\ntrial briefing from the nine-day preclearance trial in the \nD.C.  district  court.    C.J.S.  App.  380a.    The  district \ncourt’s evaluation of plaintiffs’ claims under Perry, and \nits determination that the 2012 interim plans were law-\n\n \n\f39 \n\nful under that standard, gave the Legislature good rea-\nson to believe that the court’s 2012 interim plans were a \nlawful basis for the 2013 plans.   \n\nAs to the congressional plan, the district court found \nthat  CD27  likely  did  not  violate  Section  2  of  the  VRA \nbecause  the  court  had  restored  CD23  as  a  Latino  \nopportunity district.  C.J.S. App. 421a.  With respect to \nCD35, the court found that race had not predominated \nin its creation and that the district would not fail strict \nscrutiny in any event.  Id. at 409a-415a.  The court like-\nwise stated that in preserving the unaltered districts in \nthe  State  House  plan,  it  was  “following  the  Supreme \nCourt’s direction to leave undisturbed any district that \nis  free  from  legal  defect.”    H.J.S.  App.  303a  (citing \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 393-394).  The court thus adopted the \n2012 interim plans only after considering, albeit prelim-\ninarily, the merits of all pending VRA and constitutional \nchallenges.   \n\nThird,  the  district  court’s  2012  interim  plans  made \nnumerous ameliorative changes to other districts, which \nsupported the Legislature’s conclusion that the interim \nplans  had  likely  cured  any  defects  in  the  2011  plans.  \nThe \ninterim  congressional  plan  made  significant \nchanges to nine congressional districts, which included \nrestoring CD23 as a Latino opportunity district.  C.J.S. \nApp. 417a-421a.  The court concluded that the restora-\ntion of CD23 “substantially addresse[d]” any Section 2 \nviolation  involving  Latino  voters  in  South  and  West \nTexas,  including  those  residing  in  Nueces  County \n(CD27).  Id. at 421a.  After that change, there were at \nleast eleven congressional districts in the 2012 interim \nplan  in  which  minority  voters  had  the  opportunity  to \nelect their candidates of choice, as opposed to only ten \nsuch districts in the 2011 plan.  Id. at 297a, 399a. \n\n \n\f40 \n\nSimilarly,  in  the  interim  State  House  plan, the  dis-\ntrict  court  made  “substantial[]”  changes  to  21  State \nHouse districts.  H.J.S. App. 314a.  The number of mi-\nnority opportunity districts in the State House plan was \nthereby increased  from 45  or  46 in  the  2011  map  to  at \nleast 50 in the 2013 map.  See 11-cv-1303 Docket entry \nNo.  79-2,  at  8  (D.D.C.  Oct.  25,  2011)  (comparing  num-\nbers in 2011 map to those in benchmark pre-2011 map); \nH.J.S.  App.  308a-309a  (noting  that  2012  interim  plan \n“offset” any “retrogression” in the 2011 plan). \n  Fourth,  the  court-ordered  2012  plans  were  created \nas compromise maps acceptable to both the State and to \nseveral plaintiffs.  C.J.S. App. 6a, 368a; see D. Ct. Doc. \n660  (Feb.  16,  2012)  ( joint  advisory  filed by defendants \nand  by  the  Texas  Latino  Redistricting  Task  Force \nplaintiffs proposing interim congressional plan); D. Ct. \nDoc. 668 (Feb. 21, 2012) (same for interim State House \nplan).16  That some (although not all) plaintiffs approved \nof  the  interim  plans  further  supports  the  reasonable-\nness  of  the  Legislature’s  belief  that  those  plans  were \nlawful.   \n\n2.  Neither  the  district  court  nor  plaintiffs’  filings  to \ndate in this Court have identified sufficient evidence \nto rebut the strong presumption of good faith \nThe  district  court’s  orders  and  the  plaintiffs’  \njurisdictional-stage filings in this Court do not point to \nevidence  that  would  be  sufficient  to  rebut  the  strong \n\n16  Although the Texas Latino Redistricting Task Force plaintiffs \nhad alleged that the 2011 State House and congressional plans “di-\nlut[ed] Latino voting strength statewide,” D. Ct. Doc. 68, ¶ 21 (July \n25, 2011), those plaintiffs brought no challenges to the 2013 congres-\nsional plan, and as to the 2013 State House plan those plaintiffs chal-\nlenged only a single district (HD90, which was modified in 2013 from \nthe district court’s interim plan).  C.J.S. App. 12a-13a. \n\n \n                                                      \n\f41 \n\npresumption of good faith that applies to the 2013 Leg-\nislature’s  re-adoption  of  the  unchanged  districts  from \nthe district court’s interim plan.  The district court re-\nlied  on  its  assessment  that  the  “Legislature  did  not \nadopt the [2012 interim] plans with the intent to adopt \nlegally compliant plans free from discriminatory taint,” \nC.J.S. App. 40a, but rather as a “litigation strategy de-\nsigned  to  insulate the 2011  or  2013 plans  from  further \nchallenge,” id. at 41a.  Plaintiffs endorse that rationale \nin their filings in this Court.  See 17-586 Mot. to Dismiss \n12, 21 n.9; 17-626 MALC Mot. to Dismiss 29.  But those \nassertions appear not to rest on evidence, but rather on \na misunderstanding of the law.   \n\nTo  the  extent  Texas  adopted  the  2013  plans  with  a \nview  to  resolving  existing  litigation  against  the  2011 \nplans, it is unclear why the district court regarded that \nstrategy as inherently pernicious.  An intent to end liti-\ngation,  without  more,  is  not  an  intent  to  discriminate.  \nIndeed, the best way to end litigation is to adopt a re-\ndistricting  plan  that  complies  with  the  Voting  Rights \nAct and the Constitution.  And if a federal court has pro-\nvisionally determined that a particular action is unlawful \nand imposes an interim remedy, and if a legislature per-\nmanently adopts that remedy in lieu of continuing to con-\ntest the lawfulness of the original action, the State’s ac-\nceptance  of  the  judicial  plan  presumptively  furthers—\nnot frustrates—Congress’s goal in enacting the VRA of \nameliorating unlawful discrimination.   \n\nMoreover, even when a State replaces a judicial rem-\nedy without fully adopting it, this Court’s decisions re-\nquire  that  federal  courts  treat  such  plans  with  defer-\nence.  See pp. 28-29, supra.  It follows that a State that \nenacts a court-approved plan in order to obviate a need \nfor litigation concerning prospective compliance should \n\n \n\f42 \n\nreceive,  at  a  minimum,  the  same  deference.  Were  the \nlaw  otherwise,  every  state  legislative  remedy  under-\ntaken  against  the  backdrop  of  redistricting  litigation \nwould  be  presumptively  improper,  in  contravention  of \nthis Court’s “presumption of good faith” for state legis-\nlative  enactments,  Miller,  515  U.S.  at  915,  and  its  en-\ncouragement  of  state  legislative  remedies,  Wise,  437 \nU.S. at 540 (principal opinion).  Cf. Ricci v. DeStefano, \n557 U.S. 557, 581 (2009) (recognizing value of “voluntary \ncompliance” in Title VII context).   \n\nIn  any  event,  the  district  court  did  not  identify  the \nevidence  that  it  believed  supported  its  assertion  that \nthe  2013  Legislature  acted  with  an  intent  to  discrimi-\nnate  rather  than  an  “intent  to  adopt  legally  compliant \nplans.”  C.J.S. App. 40a.  Rather, the court’s statement \nappears to rest on its mistaken belief that the Legisla-\nture was under an affirmative obligation to undertake a \n“deliberative process to ensure that the 2013 plan cured \nany taint from the 2011 plans,” ibid., and an ensuing in-\nference that the Legislature’s failure to discharge that \nobligation was proof of ill motive.  But to the extent that \nthe 2013 Legislature relied on the district court’s legal \nand  factual  judgments  rather  than  second-guessing \nthem,  such  reliance  is  more  naturally  understood  as  a \nsign of good faith.  Indeed, the Legislature’s refusal to \nadopt significant changes is consistent with a legislative \nintent to avoid creating (even inadvertently) new viola-\ntions of the VRA.   \n\nThe district court also cited evidence that the Legis-\nlature’s  counsel,  Jeff  Archer,  advised  legislators  that \nthe district court’s 2012 findings were preliminary and \ntherefore  not  “full  determinations”  on  the  merits  of \nevery claim.  C.J.S. App. 43a; see 17-586 Mot. to Dismiss \n21  (relying  on  same  evidence).    But  the  district  court’s \n\n \n\f43 \n\norders  on  the  2012  interim  plans  were,  at  a  minimum, \nhighly relevant in assessing Texas’s legal obligations and \nthe likely merits of plaintiffs’ claims.  The fact that the \nLegislature  knew  that  the  court-ordered  interim  maps \nwere not based on a final adjudication of plaintiffs’ claims \nconcerning the 2011 plans, and yet adopted those maps \nanyway, can quite reasonably be understood as reflect-\ning  the  Legislature’s  judgment  that  the  court-ordered \nmaps provided the best evidence available as to what re-\nmedial plans would comply with federal law.17  But in any \nevent, the non-final nature of the district court’s deter-\nminations  underlying  its  interim  plans  is  not,  without \nmore, affirmative evidence of discriminatory intent. \n\nThe district court also observed that the 2013 Legis-\nlature had “steadfast[ly] refus[ed]” to consider the pos-\nsibility  of  drawing  new  “coalition”  districts,  which  the \ndistrict court had earlier found “could be required” by \nthe VRA.  C.J.S. Pet. App. 40a; cf. p. 10 n.5, supra.  But \nthe  Legislature  may  have  believed  that  the  necessary \nfactual  predicate,  including  proof  of  cohesive  voting \namong  Hispanic  and  African-American  voters,  did  not \nexist  to  require  drawing  new  coalition  districts.   This \nCourt  had  stated  in  Perry  that  if  the  district  court,  in \nadopting its 2011 interim plans, had set out to create a \n\n17  Texas’s post-trial briefing before the district court cited sev-\neral pieces of record evidence consistent with this understanding.  \nSee,  e.g.,  JX-10.4  at  26  (Representative  Drew  Darby,  Chairman, \nHouse  Select  Committee  on  Redistricting)  (“[T]he  interim  maps \nrepresent the District Court’s best judgment as to  * * *  fully legal \nand  constitutional  redistricting  plans.”);  JX-13.4  at  151  (Repre-\nsentative Travis Clardy, Member, House Select Committee on Re-\ndistricting) (“[I]nterim means interim, I understand that, but it’s \na  good, fair  map  drawn  by  three  hard-working  impartial  federal \njudges who are very well acquainted with the law.  Don’t you think \nit’s reasonable that  * * *  we use those maps?”). \n\n \n                                                      \n\f44 \n\nminority coalition district, “it had no basis for doing so.”  \n565 U.S. at 399.  The district court also did not include \nany new coalition districts in its 2012 interim plans.  And \nthe  district  court  ultimately  rejected  plaintiffs’  claims \nthat the Legislature should have created additional co-\nalition districts in 2013.  See H.J.S. App. 7a, 9a-12a, 14a, \n16a, 20a-22a, 24a-26a, 85a; C.J.S. App. 49a-51a, 53a-85a.  \nFinally, the district court noted that the 2013 Legis-\nlature “pushed the redistricting bills through quickly in \na special session,” C.J.S. App. 40a, which began on May \n27, 2013, and ended on June 25, 2013.  But the Governor \nconvened a special session only because the Legislature \nhad  ended  its  regular  session  in  May  2013  without  any \nnew  redistricting  plans  to  replace  the  2011  plans,  for \nwhich  the  D.C.  district  court  had  denied  preclearance.  \nAnd because  the  Legislature  sits  in regular session  for \nonly 140 days every two years, see Tex. Const. art. III, \n§§ 5(a), 24(b), a special session was necessary if the Leg-\nislature was to adopt new redistricting plans before the \n2014 elections.  The “quick[ness]” of the special session \nmay  reflect  only  that  “no  [special]  session  shall  be  of \nlonger duration than thirty days.”  Id. § 40.  \n\nIII.  THE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  IN  CONCLUDING \nIS  AN  \n\nTHAT  CONGRESSIONAL  DISTRICT  35 \nUNCONSTITUTIONAL RACIAL GERRYMANDER \n  A.  This Court  applies  a two-step  analysis in deter-\nmining whether a State has violated the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause through racial gerrymandering.  At the first \nstep, plaintiffs must prove that “race was the predomi-\nnant factor motivating the legislature’s decision to place \na significant number of voters within or without” a par-\nticular  district.   Alabama Legislative Black Caucus  v. \nAlabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1267 (2015) (citation omitted).  \nAt  the  second  step,  the  burden  shifts  to  the  State  to \n\n \n\f45 \n\n“prove  that  its  race-based  sorting  of  voters  serves  a \n‘compelling  interest’  and  is  ‘narrowly  tailored’  to  that \nend.”  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (quoting Bethune-Hill, \n137  S. Ct.  at  800).    When  a  State  invokes  compliance \nwith the Voting Rights Act as the “compelling interest” \njustifying  its  race-based  apportionment,  it  must  show \nthat  it had  “ ‘good  reasons’ ”  for  concluding that  its  ac-\ntions  were  required  by  the  VRA.    Ibid.    (quoting  Ala-\nbama, 135 S. Ct. at 1274). \n\nB.  The district court erred in finding a racial gerry-\nmander in CD35.  As an initial matter, the 2013 Legisla-\nture  adopted  CD35 in its  present  form  in  2013  because \nthat  district  had  received  judicial  endorsement  in  the \ncourt-ordered  interim  congressional  plan.    Thus,  the \n“predominant” consideration in establishing the bounda-\nries of CD35 in 2013 was that they matched the district \nprovisionally deemed lawful by the three-judge court.  \n\nIn any event, the State had “good reasons” to believe \nthat  the  VRA  required  it  to  draw  CD35  in  2011  and \nmaintain it in 2013.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464.  The dis-\ntrict court’s own decision in 2012 concluded that Texas \nhad good reasons for drawing CD35 as it did.  Although \nthe  district  court  provisionally  concluded  in  2012  that \nrace did not predominate in drawing the district, it also \nfound  that  “[p]laintiffs  [had  not]  demonstrated  a  sub-\nstantial likelihood that CD35 would fail a strict scrutiny \nanalysis  [even]  if  strict  scrutiny  applies.”    C.J.S.  App. \n415a.  The court noted that Texas had defended CD35 \nin  the  preclearance  proceedings  as  a  “minority  oppor-\ntunity district,” id. at 411a, and it observed that CD35 \nhad been designed to have  a  “Hispanic  majority”  with \n“ ‘above 50 percent of [Hispanic citizen voting age pop-\nulation],’ ”  ibid.  (citation  omitted).    Indeed,  the  court \ncounted  CD35  among  the  seven  “Latino  opportunity \n\n \n\f46 \n\ndistricts” that it perceived as necessary to satisfy plain-\ntiffs’  Section  2  “results”  claims  in  South  and  West \nTexas.    Id.  at  409a.    Although  the  district  court’s  ap-\nproval  of  CD35  in  2012  was  provisional,  that  endorse-\nment  provided  at  least  “breathing  room”  for  Texas  to \nconclude, in 2013, that CD35 addressed a VRA need and \nthat maintaining it would not violate the Equal Protec-\ntion Clause.  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation omitted).  \nIn  addition  to  the  district  court’s  endorsement  of \nCD35 in 2012, there were other “good reasons” for Texas \nto  believe  that  Section  2  of  the  VRA  required  drawing \nCD35 as a Hispanic-majority district.  It is uncontested \nthat Section 2 required no fewer than seven Latino op-\nportunity  districts  in  South  and  West  Texas.    C.J.S. \nApp. 112a & n.85, 126a-127a, 176a.  And the State had \nreason to believe that CD35 would satisfy Gingles; map-\ndrawers and members of the Legislature in 2011 were \naware of substantial Hispanic populations in Austin and \nSan  Antonio,  and  were  furnished  with  analyses  of  ra-\ncially  polarized  voting  (RPV)  showing  information \nabout polarization statewide and in each district, includ-\ning  District  35.    See  C.J.S.  Supp.  App.  67a-69a,  201a, \n366a, 467a-469a, 481a-482a.  Indeed, one group of plain-\ntiffs  proposed  and  supported  the  creation  of  CD35  as \n“an appropriate § 2” Latino opportunity district during \nthe  2011  redistricting  process.    C.J.S.  App.  174a;  see \nC.J.S.  Supp.  App.  158a  (describing  CD35  as  a  “[n]ew \nHispanic VRA district”); C.J.S. Supp. App. 152a, 316a-\n317a, 319a-320a.  \n  C.  The district court’s ruling that CD35 failed “strict \nscrutiny review” because it was “not narrowly tailored to \nthe  State’s  professed  interest  in  avoiding  § 2  liability,” \nC.J.S.  App.  113a,  177a,  rests  on  misunderstandings  of \n\n \n \n\f47 \n\nSection 2’s requirements, the trial record, and the strict-\nscrutiny standards articulated by this Court.   \n  As explained (pp. 4-5, supra), to make a prima facie \nshowing of vote dilution under Section 2, a plaintiff must \nprove,  inter  alia,  that  the  majority  group  would  vote \n“sufficiently as a bloc to enable it  * * *  usually to defeat \nthe  minority’s  preferred  candidate.”    Thornburgh  v. \nGingles,  478  U.S.  30,  51  (1986)  (citation  omitted).    The \ndistrict court concluded that that precondition could not \nbe met for CD35 because “[e]vidence from county-level \nelections”  in  Travis  County  “shows  substantial  Anglo \ncrossover  voting,”  such  that  “the  Anglo  majority  does \nnot  usually  defeat  the  minority-preferred  candidate.” \nC.J.S.  App.  175a.    But  only  a  small  share  (21%)  of  the \ntotal  population  of  Travis  County  is  included  in  CD35.  \nId. at 181a.  The district court did not address whether \nvoting patterns were racially polarized within the par-\nticular portion of Travis County included in CD35, nor \ndid it address whether voting patterns were racially po-\nlarized across CD35 as a whole (i.e., including both ar-\neas inside and outside Travis County).  And the district \ncourt cited no precedent in support of its apparent as-\nsumption that a State necessarily lacks good reasons to \ndraw a Section 2 district any time that a district includes \n(or,  as  here,  partially  overlaps  with)  a  community  in \nwhich  racial  polarization  is  not  apparent.    To  the  con-\ntrary, this Court has recently reaffirmed that “the basic \nunit of analysis for racial gerrymandering claims  * * *  \nis the district,” and has stated that “[c]oncentrating on \nparticular portions [of the district] in isolation may ob-\nscure  the  significance  of  relevant  districtwide  evi-\ndence.”  Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 799-800. \n  Applying a “holistic analysis,” Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. \nat 800, the record confirms that it would be inappropriate \n\n \n\f48 \n\nto deem CD35 an improper Section 2 district solely be-\ncause of a purported lack of racially polarized voting in \nTravis  County.    See  D.  Ct.  Doc.  681-3,  at  7  (Feb.  28, \n2012).  The total population of CD35 is 698,488.  Ibid.  The \ntotal  Hispanic  population  of  CD35  is  438,819  persons, \nmore  than  two-thirds  of  whom  reside  outside  Travis \nCounty.    Ibid.    The  total  Anglo  population  of  CD35  is \n175,726  persons,  nearly  three-quarters  of  whom  reside \noutside  Travis  County.    Ibid.    Within  CD35,  the  Anglo \npopulation  from  Travis  County  is  only  45,272  persons.  \nIbid.  Thus, even assuming a showing that Anglos in the \ncovered  portion  of Travis  County did  not  engage in  ra-\ncially  polarized  voting,  that  would  fail  to  establish  that \nAnglos districtwide would not vote so as “usually to de-\nfeat  the  minority’s  preferred  candidate.”    Gingles,  478 \nU.S. at 51.  And it is uncontroverted that racially polar-\nized  voting  existed  throughout  the  counties  making  up \nthe majority of CD35.  See C.J.S. App. 21a (stating that \nthe existence of racially polarized voting outside Travis \nCounty was “essentially undisputed” and “supported by \nall the expert testimony in the case”). \n\nIn any event, even if the absence of racially polarized \nvoting  in  Travis  County  meant  that  CD35  was  not  re-\nquired  to  be  drawn  as  a  Section  2 district, the  district \ncourt  erred  in  finding  that  CD35  failed  strict  scrutiny \nfor that reason.  This Court’s precedents afford a State \n“ ‘breathing  room’  to  adopt  reasonable  compliance \nmeasures  that  may  prove,  in  perfect  hindsight,  not  to \nhave been needed.”  Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464 (citation \nomitted).  Here, because the State had, at a minimum, \n“good  reason  to  think  that  all  the  ‘Gingles  precondi-\ntions’ [were] met,” “so too it ha[d] good reason to believe \nthat  §  2  require[d]  drawing  a  majority-minority  dis-\ntrict.”  Id. at 1470.   \n\n \n \n \n \n\f49 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  the  Court  should  reject \nthe  bases  for  the  district  court’s  findings  of  intentional \ndiscrimination  as  to  eight  unchanged  districts  (CD27, \nHD32,  HD34,  HD54,  HD55,  HD103,  HD104,  and \nHD105), and it should reverse the finding of a racial ger-\nrymander  as  to  the  remaining  unchanged  district \n(CD35). \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\n  NOEL J.
