        "QUESTIONS PRESENTED \n\nThe  district  court  found  that  two  congressional \ndistricts  (“CDs”)  created  by  the  Texas  Legislature  in \n2011, and subsequently retained by the Legislature in \n2013, are legally infirm: CD35 as an unconstitutional \nracial gerrymander, and CD27 as an intentional and \neffective  dilution  of  Latino  voting  rights  under  §2  of \nthe Voting Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment. \n\n1.  Does the Court have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§  1253  to  hear  the  State’s  appeal  prior  to  entry  of \ninjunctive relief? \n\n2.  Did  the  district  court  commit  clear  error  in \ncarefully considering the substantial factual record of \nracial predominance in the drawing of CD35, or in con-\ncluding  no  narrowly  tailored  or  compelling  justifica-\ntion supported such racial predominance? \n\n3.  Did  the  district  court  properly  find  that  CD27 \nviolates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  and  §2  of  the \nVoting Rights Act by diluting Latino voting rights? \n\n(i)",

        "INTRODUCTION \n\nThis appeal is not about a statewide congressional \nmap called Plan C235. Nor is it about a “court-drawn” \nredistricting plan at all. Rather, this appeal is about \ntwo  specific  congressional  districts,  both  drawn  line-\nby-line and block-by-block by the Texas Legislature in \n2011 in the exact configuration they maintain to this \nday.  Whether  the  plan-wide  label  slapped  onto  the \ncongressional map is C185 or C235, these two districts \nare  the  same,  occupying  the  same  territory  and  con-\ntaining  the  same  voters  that  the  2011  Legislature \ncorralled into them. \n\nIn  the  State’s  telling,  there  was  a  brief,  shining \nmoment in 2013 when Texas history reversed course \nand the Texas Legislature fell all over itself to conform \nstate conduct to a federal court’s provisional observa-\ntions. The district court rightly saw through the 2013 \nmasquerade.  \n\nBy and large, the days are long past when racially \ninvidious policies are openly declared. Instead they are \ncouched  in  pretext,  and  the  only  way  to  unmask \npretext is to pull back the curtain and see what facts \nlie  behind  it.  This  task—distinguishing  appearance \nfrom  reality—is  assigned  to  district  courts,  charged \nwith sorting through the purported facts and witness \ntestimony to ferret out unlawful racial classifications \nand racial discrimination. \n\nThe  State  and  its  new  United  States  ally  are \nopportunistically  inconsistent  in  their  treatment  of \nappearance  versus  reality.  In  asking  this  Court  to \nreview this premature appeal, they argue that regard-\nless  of  the  outward  appearance  of  the  lower  court’s",
        "2 \n\nruling,  this  Court  should  look  beyond  the  words  and \ngive it a “practical” reading to find it has jurisdiction. \nTheir emphasis on the practical effects of government \naction, however, falls away in their substantive argu-\nment. There they argue that the Court must proceed \nformalistically  and  take  at  face  value  whatever  the \nState  purveys  as  justification  for  its  redistricting \nactions.  This  Court,  they  contend,  must  accept  the \nLegislature’s ritualistic 2013 ratification of the district \ncourt’s  plainly  provisional  interim  map  order  as  a \nslate-wiping exercise and not as what the district court \nsaw  it  to  be:  an  effort  to  throw  up  a  smokescreen  to \nobscure  the  motives  underlying  the  2011  legislative \nredistricting plan as to two congressional districts left \nentirely unaltered by the 2013 bill. \n\nThe State further insists that this Court accept its \nformalistic  accounting  method  for  creating  minority \nopportunity  districts,  that,  if  accepted  at  face  value, \ngives the technical appearance of compliance with the \nVoting  Rights  Act  and  masks  the  practical  reality—\nand practical effect—of a legislative attempt to under-\nmine the Act. Much as the Legislature used a demo-\ngraphic  “nudge  factor”  to  paint  a  false  picture  of  \nthe  2011  version  of  CD23  as  a  minority  opportunity \ndistrict  when  it  was  specifically  micro-designed  to \nachieve the opposite result, the State argues that its \ndrawing  of  CD35  was  tailored  to  comply  with  its \nobligations under §2, when the reality, unearthed by \nthe  district  court,  was  that  CD35  was  designed  to \nachieve  a  double-whammy:  eliminate  a  preexisting \ncrossover  district  where  minority  voters’  rights  were \nalready protected and trade away the voting rights of \nnearly a quarter million Latinos in Nueces County two \nhundred  miles  away  by  stranding  them  in  a  new \ndistrict  where  they  are  submerged  in  a  sea  of  Anglo \nbloc voting.",
        "3 \n\nAppellees lay out the facts below in significant detail \nbecause, in a case like this where appearance is pitted \nagainst reality, the facts are all the more important. \n\nSTATEMENT \n\nAt the center of this appeal are two Texas congres-\nsional  districts  in  the  statewide  map  labeled  Plan \nC235: CDs 27 and 35. The district court found consti-\ntutional  and  statutory  violations  in  the  two  districts \nbut  has  not  yet  determined  an  appropriate  remedy. \nThe State, now joined by the United States, seeks pre-\nremedy reinstatement of the districts. \n\nCDs 27 and 35 are creatures of the 2011 Legislature. \nSections  27  and  35  of  Article  II  of  the  2011  congres-\nsional redistricting bill establish the two districts and \nspecify their census geography. Act of June 20, 2011, \n82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 1, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 5091-\n5180. When the Legislature amended the bill in 2013, \nit bypassed these two sections altogether, leaving CDs \n27 and 35 in the “exact same configuration” since 2011. \nC.J.S. App. 113a.1 \n\nA.  In League of United Latin American Citizens v. \nPerry,  548  U.S.  399  (2006)  (“LULAC  v.  Perry”),  the \nCourt  invalidated  Texas  Congressional  District  23  \nas a violation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \n§  10301.  On  remand,  the  district  court  remedied  the \nviolation, adjusting the boundaries of five Texas con-\ngressional  districts.  457  F.  Supp.  2d  716  (E.D.  Tex. \n2006).  The  court’s  changes  were  incorporated  into  a  \n\n1  “C.J.S.  App.”  refers  to  the  appendix  to  the  Jurisdictional \nStatement in Case No. 17-586. “Supp. App.” refers to the supple-\nmental appendix (containing the findings of fact) to the Motion to \nDismiss or Affirm in Case No. 17-586. “J.A.” refers to the Joint \nAppendix.",
        "4 \n\nstatewide  map  called  Plan  C100  (the  “benchmark” \nplan). It contained six Latino opportunity districts in \nthe region of the state with the heaviest concentration \nof Latino voters.2 This is the large swath of South and \nWest Texas radiating in a fan south- and southwest-\nward from Travis County—but not including it—that \nis referred to in this litigation as the South and West \nTexas “envelope.” 457 F. Supp. 2d at 720; Supp. App. \n428a.3 The benchmark plan remained in effect through \n2010.  \n\nBenchmark  CD27  ran  south  along  the  Texas  Gulf \nCoast,  from  Nueces  County  in  the  north  to  Cameron \nCounty  on  the  Mexican  border.  It  had  been  in  this \nsouthern  orientation—and  had  been  a  Latino  oppor-\ntunity district under §2—since 1982. Supp. App. 287a-\n88a,  299a.  Until  2010,  Nueces  County  Latinos  had \nbeen electing their congressional candidates of choice \nfor more than a quarter century. Id. 294a. \n\n2  A  minority  opportunity  district  under  §2  is  one  in  which \nminority voters comprise a majority of eligible voters and have a \nreasonable  opportunity  to  elect  candidates  of  their  choice.  See, \ne.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1014 n.11 (1994). As to \nterminology, this brief uses the term “Latino” instead of the term \n“Hispanic” often used in the proceedings below, but quotes and \nshorthand references, such as “HCVAP,” derived from “Hispanic” \nare left in the form used below. \n\n3  The  district  court  described  the  South  and  West  Texas \nenvelope as the “large triangular area contained by a line starting \nin Nueces County, running south to Cameron County, then along \nthe  Rio  Grande  River  to  El  Paso  County,  then  from  El  Paso \nCounty  to  Bexar  County,  then  northeast  to  the  Hays/Travis \nCounty  line,  and  back  to  Nueces  County.”  Supp.  App.  298a. \nTravis County lies north of the envelope in Central Texas. There \nis  a  seventh  Latino  opportunity  district  in  another  part  of  the \nstate—CD29  in  Harris  County—that  is  not  at  issue  in  this \nappeal.",
        "5 \n\nBenchmark  CD25  was  anchored  in  Travis  County \n(home to Austin) in Central Texas and ran southeast \nfrom  there  through  less  populated  counties.  Most  of  \nits population was in Travis County. Supp. App. 301a. \nIt functioned as a “crossover district.” Id. 340a, 428a; \nC.J.S. App. 175a-76a; Br. for State Appellants (“Br.”) \n47 n.12. \n\nThe last round of congressional elections conducted \nunder  Plan  C100  in  2010  was  a  wave  election  for \nRepublicans.  Supp.  App.  25a.  One  exception  was  in \nbenchmark CD25, where the Anglo Democratic incum-\nbent  was  reelected  with  the  support  of  Latino  and \nAfrican-American  voters.  Id.  301a,  428a.  But  else-\nwhere, Democratic incumbents fared poorly, including \nin  districts  in  South  and  West  Texas  where  Latino \nvoters who had an opportunity to elect candidates of \ntheir  choice  failed  to  do  so  in  2010.  In  benchmark \nCD27,  an  Anglo  Republican,  Blake  Farenthold,  won \nagainst  the  Latino  candidate  of  choice,  Democratic \nincumbent  Solomon  Ortiz,  by  a  less  than  1  percent \nmargin.  Id.  26a,  291a-92a.  In  benchmark  CD23,  a \nLatino opportunity district spread across West Texas \nfrom  San  Antonio  to  El  Paso,  the  Latino-preferred \nDemocratic incumbent also lost to a Republican chal-\nlenger. Id. 25a. \n\nB.  Release  of  the  2010  decennial  census  showed \nthat  the  state’s  population  had  increased  by  4.2 \nmillion  over  the  previous  decade.  Supp.  App.  457a.  \nIts population contained no racial or ethnic majority. \nDkt. No. 277 at 22 (Stip. 76). The surge in population \nyielded  Texas  four  new  congressional  seats.  Perry  v. \nPerez, 565 U.S. 388, 390 (2012). \n\nThis  massive  growth  in  population  was  dispro-\nportionately  African-American,  Latino,  and  Asian-\nAmerican. Ninety percent of the statewide population",
        "6 \n\ngrowth  was  attributable  to  minorities,  with  Latinos \nalone  accounting  for  65  percent  of  the  growth.  Supp. \nApp.  16a,  457a.  Minorities  further  accounted  for  70 \npercent of the growth in citizen voting age population \n(“CVAP”). Id. 459a. The Anglo share of CVAP, mean-\nwhile, declined in every benchmark district. Id. 460a. \n\nIn  the  South  and  West  Texas  envelope,  Latinos \naccounted  for  almost  all  of  the  CVAP  growth.  Supp. \nApp.  461a.  All  six  of  the  benchmark  plan’s  Latino \nopportunity  districts  in  the  envelope  were  overpop-\nulated. Id. 430a-31a. Collectively, they were so overpop-\nulated that enough population was left over to compose \nnearly three-quarters of a new ideal-size district. Id. \n\nTravis County also had significant population growth \nbut, in contrast to other major areas of the state, the \npace  of  Anglo  growth  essentially  equaled  the  pace  of \nLatino growth.  Supp. App. 460a-61a. \n\nC.  As the 2011 redistricting process began, Republi-\ncans  held  overwhelming  majorities  in  the  Texas \nLegislature  and  were  “hostile  to  the  creation  of  any \nminority  districts.”  Supp.  App.  38a,  476a.  They  and \ntheir  redistricting  leaders—Representative  Solomons \nin  the  House  and  Senator  Seliger  in  the  Senate—\nequated  minority  opportunity  districts  with  Demo-\ncratic districts and therefore opposed creation of any \nnew congressional district that would be dominated by \nvoters  of  color  unless  they  deemed  it  required  by  §2. \nId. 438a, 476a.4  \n\n4 Solomons and Seliger, along with Solomons’ chief mapdrawer \nRyan  Downtown,  were  “the  primary  persons  responsible  for \ndrawing  and  making  decisions  about  the  congressional  map.” \nSupp. App. 431a.",
        "7 \n\nThe  actual  mapdrawing  job  fell  to  the  House \nredistricting  committee,  chaired  by  Representative \nSolomons.  Supp.  App.  152a.  Chairman  Solomons, \nunfamiliar  with  redistricting  law  and  Voting  Rights \nAct  requirements,  appointed  staffer  Ryan  Downton, \nalso  lacking  in  redistricting  experience,  the  primary \nmapdrawer. Id. 44a, 46a, 152a. \n\nFour  foundational  principles  set  the  stage  for  the \ndrawing of the new congressional plan. First, Downton, \nwith Solomons’ and Seliger’s acquiescence, used an auto-\nmatic numerical metric for deciding what constituted \na  minority  opportunity  district  under  §2.  His  “sole \ncriterion” for determining the existence of such a dis-\ntrict was whether its population was majority CVAP \nfor  a  single  minority,  “even  if  it  never  elected  the \nminority’s  candidate  of  choice.”  Supp.  App.  437a. \nThus,  to  classify  a  district  as  a  Latino  opportunity \ndistrict, the Legislature’s chief mapdrawer set a quota \nof 50 percent or more HCVAP, regardless of actual or \nanticipated election outcomes. See, e.g., id. 383a. \n\nSecond,  the  proposal  to  create  a  new  minority \nopportunity district in the Dallas-Fort Worth (“DFW”) \narea,  Supp.  App.  253a,  256a,  was  rejected  as  not \nrequired by §2. Id. 258a-59a, 260a, 286a. \n\nThird, after the decision not to draw a new minority \nopportunity district in the DFW area, Solomons estab-\nlished a “3-1 rule” for the new districts. Regardless of \npopulation  growth,  only  one  of  the  four  new  seats \nwould be a district favoring Democrats and, perforce, \nit would be a minority opportunity district. Supp. App. \n286a, 435a. “Once Solomons was advised that only one \nnew VRA district was required, Solomons would only \nconsider  a  map  that  increased  the  net  number  of \nRepublican districts by three.” Id. 439a; see also C.J.S. \nApp.  172a  (objective  was  to  create  a  3-1  map  that",
        "8 \n\n“increased  the  number  of  Republican  seats  by  three \nand  Democrat  seats  by  only  one”);  id.  220a  n.73 \n(mapdrawers “adhere[d] to a 3-1 map policy”). \n\nFourth,  there  was  a  political  imperative  to  protect \ntwo Republican incumbents when drawing districts in \nthe  South  and  West  Texas  envelope.  Those  incum-\nbents, Canseco and Farenthold, had won unexpected \nvictories  in  2010  in  Latino  opportunity  districts \n(benchmark CDs 23 and 27, respectively) but neither \nwas the Latino voters’ candidate of choice. Supp. App. \n25a-26a.  The  mapdrawers  knew  that  these  districts \nhad  to  be  reconfigured  to  protect  the  Republican \nincumbents, Supp. App. 151a, 293a, 342a; C.J.S. App. \n143a, 191a-92a, 393a, and that the key to this was to \ndraw in Anglo voters—and draw out Latino voters—in \nand near the envelope.5  \n\nD.  Downton, the mapdrawer, was assigned the task \nof  incorporating  these  four  basic  instructions  into  a \nstatewide map. Specifically, he was to eschew any new \ndistrict for minorities in the DFW area, use the bright-\nline 50 percent metric to measure what constitutes a \nminority opportunity district, allow a net gain of only \n\n5 These problems were highlighted as redistricting strategizing  \ngot  underway  in  late  2010  in  two  memos  by  Eric  Opiela,  the \nRepublican  congressional  delegation’s  redistricting  emissary  to \nthe Legislature and a regular confidante of Downton. Supp. App. \n442a. The first memo, directed primarily at CD23, suggested the \nuse  of  a  “nudge  factor”  to  protect  Canseco  by  “nudging”  high \nturnout  Latino  voters  out  of  the  district  and  swapping  in  low \nturnout Latino voters, increasing the total HCVAP of benchmark \nCD23 but lowering the likelihood the Latino-preferred candidate \nwould win. Id. 27a-28a, 431a-32a. The second memo, issued a few \ndays later, highlighted the “problems inherent in trying to protect \nboth  Farenthold  and  Canseco”  and  identified  the  need  to  find \nmore “Anglo voters”—a term used four times in the short memo—\nsomewhere in or near the envelope. Id. 29a.",
        "9 \n\none  Democratic  district  (deemed  synonymous  with  a \nminority opportunity district) in or near the South and \nWest  Texas  envelope,  and  protect  both  Canseco  and \nFarenthold’s incumbencies by drawing new districts in \nwhich enough Anglos were added so they would win. \nHis  solution  in  drawing  CDs  27  and  35—adopted  by \nthe 2011 Legislature, signed by the Governor, and left \nuntouched  ever  since—is  the  one  invalidated  by  the \ndistrict court and now before this Court for review. \n\n1.  DFW  Area.  As  set  forth  above,  the  proposal  to \ncreate a minority opportunity district in the DFW area \nhad  been  flatly  rejected.  Implementing  this  instruc-\ntion, however, was no easy feat in light of the massive \nminority  population  growth  in  the  area,  which \naccounted  for  adding  a  new  seat  there,  Supp.  App. \n286a.  Using  racial  data,  the  mapdrawers  sliced  and \ndiced the minority population to “decrease current and \nfuture  minority  voting  strength,”  and  district  lines \n“pulled  strangely-shaped  minority  population  areas \nout  of  certain  districts  in  order  to  submerge  them  \nin  larger  Anglo  populations  and  to  reduce  minority \nvoting strength.” C.J.S. App. 400a; Supp. App. 286a. \n\n2.  CD23.  In  CD23,  two  of  the  basic  instructions \nconverged. Mapdrawers used the bright-line 50 percent \nHCVAP  metric  for  what  would  be  deemed  a  Latino \nopportunity  district  and,  working  within  that  frame-\nwork, assiduously traded precincts in and out to imple-\nment  the  “nudge  factor”  concept  to  protect  Canseco’s \nincumbency.  Working  closely  with  others,  Downton \nput the nudge factor to work, painstakingly identifying \nprecincts  with  high  Latino  presence  and  low  Latino \nturnout, and then artfully manipulating district lines \nto  increase  HCVAP  percentage  while  excluding  high \nturnout Latino precincts from the district. C.J.S. App.",
        "10 \n106a,  145a;  Supp.  App.  391a.6  The  Legislature  then \nassigned CD23 to the category of “Latino opportunity \ndistrict,”  even  though  it  was  drawn  for  the  specific \npurpose of ensuring that the Latino-preferred candidate \nwould  not  win.  C.J.S.  App.  146a.  In  other  words, \nborrowing  from  the  2003  legislative  playbook,  the \nLegislature reconfigured benchmark CD23 “to protect \na Republican candidate who was not the Latino candi-\ndate of choice from the Latino voting majority in the \ndistrict.” Id. 144a; see also id. 147a-48a (CD23 recon-\nfigured  to  “create  the  facade  of  a  Latino  opportunity \ndistrict”).  The  district  had  been  “nudged”  from  one \nthat performed for Latino voters to one that would not. \n\nEven with the putative Latino opportunity district \nin CD23, the Legislature knew that §2 would require \none more Latino opportunity district in the South and \nWest Texas envelope, for a total of seven. Supp. App. \n435a; C.J.S. App. 176a, 392a.  \n\n3.  CD27 and Nueces County. Nueces County (home \nto Corpus Christi) contains 206,000 Latinos, 133,370 \nof them citizens of voting age, and is overwhelmingly \nLatino in total population. Supp. App. 294a; JX-100.2. \nBenchmark  CD27,  which  housed  the  entirety  of \nNueces County, was a Latino opportunity district that, \nas of 2011, was overpopulated by only 43,500 people. \nSupp.  App.  293a.  Voting  in  Nueces  County  is  highly \npolarized along racial lines. Id. 300a; C.J.S. App. 183a, \n185a.  \n\nThe mapdrawers knew that the obvious solution to \nthe §2 problem the State faced in the South and West \nTexas envelope was to leave Nueces County, or most \nof  it,  in  the  envelope  and  in  its  long-time  southward \n\n6  The  district  court  found  Downton’s  denials  of  the  cohesion \n\nand turnout manipulation “not credible.” C.J.S. App. 146a n.20.",
        "11 \n\norientation.  Supp.  App.  297a.  As  the  district  court \nexplained: “Including the population of Nueces County \nin the envelope makes it easier to draw seven Latino \nopportunity  districts  under  §2,”  without  extending \nbeyond the envelope into Travis County. Id. 300a.  \n\nInstead, however, Downton removed Nueces County \nentirely from the South and West Texas districts and \ndrew it into a district oriented northward, out of the \nenvelope. Supp. App. 293a, 298a-99a; see J.A. 450a.7  \n\n7  The  geographic  details,  down  to  street  level,  of  individual \ndistricts  in  Plan  C235  are  available  online  at  the  public  Texas \nRedistricting  website  maintained  by  the  Texas  Legislative \nCouncil. See District Viewer interactive map: Plan C235, http:// \nwww.tlc.state.tx.us/redist/districts/congress.html.",
        "12 \n\nWhile  mapdrawers  and  legislators  understood  that \nthey could have protected Farenthold in a northward-\noriented district while at the same time retaining most \nof Nueces County—and nearly all of its Latinos—in an \nopportunity  district  oriented  southward,  Supp.  App. \n297a, they deliberately chose not do so, id. 299a-300a. \n\nThe  “primary  and  dominant  motive”  driving  this \ndecision “was to place the incumbent Farenthold, who \nlived in Nueces County and would likely be ousted by \nthe  existing  Latino  majority,  into  an  Anglo-majority \ndistrict (and thus to take away the opportunity to elect \nthat Nueces County Latinos had enjoyed).” C.J.S. App. \n191a.  The  method  chosen  to  effectuate  this  purpose \nwas  to  strand  all  Nueces  County  Latinos—nearly  a \nquarter of a million of them—in a new majority-Anglo \nCD27  where  they  have  “no  opportunity”  to  elect \ncandidates of their choice. Id. 190a; Supp. App. 294a-\n96a, 433a.  \n\nTo ensure that the purposeful elimination of bench-\nmark  CD27  as  a  Latino  opportunity  district  would  \nnot  result  in  one  less  such  district  in  the  envelope, \nDownton  and  the  Legislature  substituted  a  new \nCD34—a  Latino  opportunity  district—running  north \nalong  the  Gulf  coast  from  Cameron  County  on  the \nMexican  border  south  of  Nueces  County.  Supp.  App. \n299a.  Having  satisfied  their  objective  of  protecting \nFarenthold by drawing Nueces County Latinos out of \nthe  envelope,  the  mapdrawers  set  to  the  task  of \ncreating the §2-mandated seventh Latino opportunity \ndistrict. \n\n4.  CD35,  Benchmark  CD25,  and  Travis  County.  \nFor  their  new  Latino  opportunity  district,  Downton \nand  the  Legislature  looked  to  Travis  County.  To  be \nsure,  the  Legislature  had  “no  reasonable  basis”  for \nconcluding that a §2 Latino opportunity district should",
        "13 \n\nbe  drawn  in  the  county.  Supp.  App.  340a,  342a.  Nor \nwas it necessary to draw any of Travis County into a \nnew Latino opportunity district in order to reach the \nobjective of adding one in the South and West Texas \nenvelope.  Id.  340a,  440a.8  But  the  Legislature  did  \nit  anyway.  It  used  race  as  a  tool  not  to  comply  with  \n§2,  but  to  obtain  political  advantage  by  creating  the \n“facade of complying with § 2 while actually minimiz-\ning the number of districts in which minorities could \nelect  their  candidates  of  choice  despite  the  massive \nminority  population  growth  that  had  occurred \nthroughout  the  state.”  C.J.S.  App.  178a;  see  also  id. \n110a  (putting  Travis  County  population  into  CD35 \n“use[d] race as a tool for partisan goals”). \n\nUnder the benchmark plan, Travis County already \nanchored  benchmark  CD25,  the  crossover  district \nwhere,  with  Anglo  crossover  support,  Latinos  and \nAfrican  Americans  were  able  to  elect  their  congres-\nsional  candidate  of  choice.  Supp.  App.  306a.  And,  in \nstark contrast to the burgeoning Latino growth in the \nSouth and West Texas envelope, which had the most \nconcentrated HCVAP increase in the State, id. 461a, \nTravis County was not an area where Latino growth \nhugely outpaced other growth. C.J.S. App. 169a.  \n\nEven  more  importantly,  Travis  County  is  the  only \nlocale  in  the  state  with  legally  insignificant  levels  of \nracially polarized voting as a whole. C.J.S. App. 175a. \n“Anglo voters do not show high levels of cohesion and \ndo  not  vote  as  a  bloc  against  the  minority-preferred \ncandidates.” Supp. App. 340a. In short, Travis County \n\n8  Downton  “did  not  think  CD35  was  necessary  for  §  5 \ncompliance, and he was not sure if it was required by § 2.” C.J.S. \nApp. 178a-79a n.45. He did not have “any evidence . . . to support \nthe  inclusion  of  Travis  County  in  the  new  §  2  district  when  he \ndecided to place the district there.” Id.",
        "14 \n\nis  the  notable  exception  to  the  pattern  of  racially \npolarized voting that pervades Texas. C.J.S. App. 21a. \n\nDespite  these  facts,  the  mapdrawers  deliberately \ndismantled  benchmark  CD25  by  drawing  the  state’s \nonly  new  Latino  opportunity  district,  CD35,  into \nTravis County. C.J.S. App. 110a (CD35 placement was \nto “intentionally destroy” benchmark CD25). The new \nplan  divided  Travis  County,  and  its  more  than  one \nmillion  residents,  into  five  congressional  districts, \nnone anchored in the county. Supp. App. 333a. \n\nThe mechanism used to draw CD35 so as to destroy \nCD25, moreover, was race. Downton testified that he \npurposely selected Anglo Democrats in the county and \nseparated  them  into  different  districts.  Supp.  App. \n318a.  He  turned  on  the  software’s  block-level  racial \nshading function to search out Latinos in Travis County. \nId.  337a-38a.  Using  this  capability,  he  reached  into \nnorth central Austin with a narrow “squiggle” that had \nno other purpose than to grab an area that was 90-100",

He \ndisregarded  state  House  district  lines,  and  carved \nthose areas into several congressional pieces, because \nthe  House  lines  did  not  mesh  with  his  racial  line-\ndrawing  objective.  Supp.  App.  320a.  Analysis  of  the \nTravis County divisions show that race was twice as \nlikely  as  party  vote  to  predict  whether  a  voting \nprecinct  ended  up  in  CD35.  Id.  337a.  “The  higher \npercent  Hispanic  a  VTD,  the  more  likely  it  was \nincluded  in  CD35,  and  the  higher  percent  Anglo  a \nVTD,  the  less  likely  it  was  included  in  CD35.”  Id.9 \nCongressional district lines in the county did not align \n“with any recognizable communities other than race.” \nId. 320a. The net effect of the mapdrawers’ race-based \nconfiguration of CD35 in Travis County was to reduce \nby 63,000 the number of Travis County Latino voters \nwith  the  opportunity  to  elect  their  candidates  of \nchoice. Id. 336a.  \n\nThe  southern  end  of  CD35,  in  south  San  Antonio, \nwas equally race-based in its design. C.J.S. App. 169a. \nThe  district  runs  south  out  of  Travis  County  in  a  3-\nmile wide strip along Interstate 35 for fifty miles, then \nfunnels through a narrow neck in northeastern Bexar \nCounty because the area contains low concentrations \nof Latinos. Id. 414a; Supp. App. 318a. The district then \nwidens to include a large concentration of Latinos on \nthe south side of San Antonio.  \n\nAs the district court concluded, CD35 was also the \nleast  compact  of  all  of  the  districts  drawn  in  2011. \nSupp.  App.  339a.  It  retained  this  distinction  in  Plan \n\n9 The expert analysis by Dr. Ansolabehere in his 2014 report is \n\nthe underpinning for these court findings. See J.A. 494a-97a.",

After  one  plaintiff  group  petitioned  for  a  stay  of  the \ninterim plan order, the State successfully opposed the stay pri-\nmarily on the ground of short-term necessity. LULAC v. Texas, \nNo.  12A234.  “The  interim  maps  were  designed  to  provide  an \ninterim solution for the upcoming elections. . . and need to be used \nfor  the  purpose  for  which  they  were  designed.”  Opposition  to \nApplication  for  Emergency  Stay  3  (Sept.  12,  2012)  (emphasis \nadded).  According  to  the  State,  “[t]he  whole  point  of  drawing \ninterim maps was to . . . have certainty about the shape of their \ndistricts for the upcoming election process.” Id. at 10.",
        "19 \n\nclaims,  particularly  with  respect  to  CDs  27  and  35.  \nId. 6a (quoting 2012 interim order). \n\nSeveral months later, in late August 2012, the D.C. \ncourt  denied  preclearance,  unanimously  concluding \nthat Plan C185, including CDs 27 and 35, “was enacted \nwith a discriminatory purpose.” Texas v. United States, \n887  F.  Supp.2d  133,  159  (D.D.C.  2012),  vacated  on \nother  grounds,  570  U.S.  928  (2013).  Pointedly,  the \ncourt explained that “[t]he parties have provided more \nevidence of discriminatory intent than we have space, \nor need, to address here,” id. at 161 n.32, and that it \nwas “persuaded by the totality of the evidence that the \nplan  was  enacted  with  discriminatory  intent,”  id.  at \n161. The court further determined that Texas had vio-\nlated  §5  by  dismantling  the  Travis  County-anchored \nbenchmark  CD25,  which  was  home  to  a  “tri-ethnic \ncrossover coalition” where minority voters had had an \nopportunity  to  elect  their  congressional  candidate  of \nchoice. Id. at 184, 190. Texas appealed. \n\nF.  In  2013,  while  the  preclearance  appeal  was \npending with this Court, the Governor called a special \nlegislative  session—on  one  day’s  notice—for  the \nexpress purpose of repealing Plan C185 and adopting \nPlan C235. Supp. App. 231a; C.J.S. App. 40a. This was \nonly  two  years  after  Plan  C185’s  enactment;  legisla-\ntive leadership was the same and so were 75 percent \nof the legislators. C.J.S. App. 38a n.37; Dkt. No. 1442, \nStips. 1-4 (June 28, 2017). The Legislature effectively \namended Plan C185 by adopting the changes made in \nPlan  C235.  Half  of  Plan  C185’s  districts,  including \nCDs 27 and 35, were left in place.13 \n\n13  The  census  block  assignments  in  ten  districts,  including \nCD35,  are  the  same  in  Plans  C185  and  C235.

        "20 \n\nThe district court found that “[t]he Legislature did \nnot  adopt  the  Court’s  plans  with  the  intent  to  adopt \nlegally compliant plans free from discriminatory taint, \nbut as part of a litigation strategy.” C.J.S. App. 40a.14 \nThat  litigation  strategy  was  to  evade  the  same  find-\nings of discriminatory intent in the San Antonio court \nthat had already been made by the D.C. court, and to \nclaim protection from the district court’s preliminary \napproval of the interim plan to insulate the State from \nfurther liability. By adopting the interim plan, “how-\never  flawed,”  the  State  sought  to  “prevent  Plaintiffs \nfrom obtaining relief for purposeful racial discrimina-\ntion.” Id. 44a. \n\nThe district court’s express warnings about the limi-\ntations of its 2012 interim plan did not go unnoticed \nby the Legislature’s own attorney. See J.A. 437a-48a. \nIn public testimony, he meticulously walked the legis-\nlators  through  the  court’s  caveats  and  their  implica-\ntions  for  the  legislative  action  under  consideration. \nThe  Legislature,  he  explained,  could  not  rely  on  \nthe  district  court’s  2012  interim  plan  order  as  proof  \nthe  plan  complied  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act  or \nConstitution. The district court, he said, had been “in \na little bit [of a] tricky [position] because [it] had not \nmade  full  determinations,  .  .  .  had  not  made  fact \nfindings on every issue, had not thoroughly analyzed \nall the evidence but they had to make some best-case \nguesses.” C.J.S. App. 43a (citation omitted). \n\ndistricts,  including  CD27,  are  assigned  the  same  populated \ncensus blocks in both plans. Dkt. No. 1442, Stips. 7-8. \n\n14 This unanimous finding was based in part upon documents \npreviously  withheld  by  the  State  but  ordered  released  in  the \nmiddle  of  trial,  and  upon  the  district  court’s  assessment  of  the \ntrial  testimony  of  Rep.  Drew  Darby—a  redistricting  committee \nchairman for the 2013 special session.  C.J.S. App. 44a-45a n.45.",
        "21 \n\n“[W]illfully ignor[ing] those who pointed out deficien-\ncies,” C.J.S. App. 45a n.45, including its own attorney, \non June 24, 2013, the Legislature ratified Plan C235, \nincluding the 2011 versions of CDs 27 and 35.  \n\nG.  The  district  court  subsequently  conducted  two \nweek-long  trials,  first  on  Plan  C185  in  2014,  then  \non  Plan  C235  in  2017.  In  both,  the  issues  as  to  CDs  \n27 and 35 remained the same, because the “exact same \nconfiguration  of  CD35  and  CD27  remains  in  Plan \nC235” as in Plan C185. C.J.S. App. 113a. The district \ncourt’s  March  2017  ruling  on  Plan  C185  established \nthat  intentional  discrimination  infected  the  2011 \nredistricting  plan,  describing  the  intentional  frac-\nturing  of  communities  of  color  and  race-based  line \ndrawing  across  the  state.  See,  e.g.,  id.  289a  (in  the \nDFW  area  “race  was  used  as  a  proxy  for  political \naffiliation  .  .  .  intentionally  to  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength”);  id.  148a-49a  (mapdrawers’  “intentional[] \ntargeting [of] Hispanic voter turnout and cohesion” in \nCD23 “bears the mark of intentional discrimination”).  \n\nThe court’s August 2017 ruling on Plan C235 effec-\ntively upheld the interim map’s compromise changes \nto  CD23  and  the  DFW-area  districts.  But  the  court \nfound differently for CDs 27 and 35. It sustained the \nchallenges  leveled  against  these  districts  since  the \ncase’s beginning in 2011. It explained that the Legisla-\nture could have complied with its §2 obligation to draw \nseven  Latino  opportunity  districts  in  the  South  and \nWest  Texas  envelope  without  extending  into  Travis \nCounty  by  retaining  Nueces  County  in  the  envelope \ndistricts.  Supp.  App.  300a.  In  finding  that  the  legis-\nlature’s  “offset”  Latino  opportunity  district,  CD35,  \nwas an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, the court \nfound  that  CD35’s  location  “was  not  to  address  §  2 \nconcerns,  but  to  intentionally  destroy  an  existing",
        "22 \n\ndistrict  [benchmark  CD25]  with  significant  minority \npopulation.” C.J.S. App. 110a.15 \n\nThe court struck down CD35 as a racial gerryman-\nder  in  both  plans.  See  C.J.S.  App.  115a  (“Although \nPlan  C235  was  enacted  in  2013,  the  decision  as  to \nwhich  voters  to  include  within  CD35  was  made  in \n2011, and that remains the proper time for evaluating \nthe district[.]”). The court found that the core African-\nAmerican  community  in  Austin  was  divided  from \nhistorical  communities  of  interest  and  “effectively \nneutered” by grouping it with a distant metropolitan \narea with which it did not share interests. Supp. App. \n335a.  It  concluded  that  “race  subordinated  other \nredistricting  principles”  in  Travis  County,  id.  339a, \n342a, where minority populations were “fractured” and \nLatino  voters  carved  out  for  inclusion  in  a  new \nmajority-minority  district  without  any  Voting  Rights \nAct \nin \njustification  because  Anglo  bloc  voting \nopposition to minority voter preferences is absent, id. \n334a, 340a. \n\nAs  to  CD27,  the  court  found  that  it  had  been \nconverted from a Latino opportunity district into one \nwhere “Latino voters have no opportunity to elect their \npreferred candidates.” C.J.S. App. 190a. The effect was \nto dilute the voting strength of the more than 200,000 \nNueces  County  Latinos  stranded  in  the  district.  Id. \n191a. And the choice was purposeful, made “to protect \nan incumbent who was not the candidate of choice of \n\n15 The court incorporated the findings of fact and opinion that \nissued  with  its  Plan  C185  ruling  a  few  months  earlier  into  the \nPlan  C235  ruling,  and  the  original  dissenting  panel  member \nagreed that the opinion and those findings constitute the law of \nthe case. C.J.S. App. 14a n.13.  The district court was unanimous \nin  its  new  factual  findings  regarding  the  purpose  of  the  2013 \nLegislature’s litigation strategy.",
        "23 \n\nthose  Latino  voters.”  Id.  190a.  After  the  Plan  C235 \ntrial,  the  court  found  that  this  discriminatory  intent \n“carr[ied]  over”  to  the  2013  adoption  of  identical  dis-\ntrict  lines,  “purposefully  .  .  .  depriv[ing]  plaintiffs  of \nany remedy.” Id. 46a, 116a. \n\nH.  The district court explained at the end of its Plan \nC235  ruling  that  its  previous  bifurcation  of  the  case \ninto separate liability and remedial phases meant that \nits ruling was only addressing the legal violations in \nC235.  C.J.S.  App.  119a.  It  gave  the  Legislature  an \nopportunity  to  remedy  those  violations  found  in  the \nruling.  This  was  hardly  the  first  time  it  had  issued \nsuch  an  invitation.  Four  months  earlier,  after  it  had \nissued  its  Plan  C185  ruling,  the  court  indicated  that \nthe  State  should  be  prepared  to  discuss  whether  the \nLegislature—then sitting in regular session—“intends \nto  take  up  redistricting  .  .  .  to  remedy  any  [C185 \nviolations]  that  persist  in  the  2013  plans”  at  an \nupcoming  hearing.  Dkt.  No.  1352.  This  request  was \nmet  with  legislative  silence.  The  court  again  invited \nthe Legislature to act following this Court’s decision in \nCooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455 (2017), see Dkt. No. \n1395, but the Legislature again declined.  \n\nAt  a  scheduling  hearing  for  the  C235  trial,  the \nState’s  attorney  told  the  court  that  October  1,  2017, \nwas a fixed date for any remedial plan to be in place. \nHr’g  Tr.  66  (Apr.  2,  2017).  Thus,  when  it  issued  the \nC235  ruling,  the  court  knew  that  the  state-declared \ndeadline  was  only  a  month  and  a  half  away.  Even \nthough the State had turned a deaf ear to its earlier \ninquiries  about  a  legislative  remedy,  the  court  once \nagain invited a legislative solution, asking the State to \nadvise  within  three  business  days—by  August  18—\nwhether a special session would be called to consider \nremedying  the  violations.  C.J.S.  App.  118a.  Absent",
        "24 \n\nsuch notification, the court indicated that it intended \nto hold a remedy hearing on September 5. Id.  \n\nUpon the State’s petition, this Court stayed further \n\nproceedings. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nTexas  appeals  from  an  order  that  found  two  legal \nviolations  in  a  redistricting  map.  The  order  enjoined \nnothing. Nor did it provide a remedy for the violations \nit found. Whether and when to issue an injunction and \nwhat remedy was needed for the two legal violations \nwere deferred so the court could hold hearings where \nthose  matters  could  be  addressed.  This  Court  lacks \njurisdiction over an appeal of this sort. \n\nIf  the  Court  decides  that  it  has  jurisdiction,  then  \nit  will  be  reviewing  the  constitutional  and  statutory \nvalidity of two specific districts, CDs 27 and 35, in a \nstatewide congressional map labeled Plan C235. Both \ndistricts were in the same place with the same people \nin the earlier statewide map labeled Plan C185. \n\nThe  Court’s  review  of  the  two  districts’  validity  \nis  under  the  clearly  erroneous  standard  set  out  in  \nRule  52(a)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  \nThe State cannot escape review under that standard \nby  the  ploy  of  using  a  perfunctory  2013  legislative \n“ratification” of an interim court map that did not even \ntouch the two districts at issue on appeal. The State \nand the United States try to change the Court’s focus \nby claiming that the plan is “court-drawn” and, hence, \nthe State is owed judicial deference in having adopted \nit. But only half of the districts in the court’s one-time-\nonly plan were “court-drawn.” The other half, includ-\ning the two districts at issue here, were “legislatively-\ndrawn”  by  the  2011  Texas  Legislature.  The  2013 \ngambit is nothing but a ruse.",
        "25 \n\nThe district court painstakingly reviewed the facts \nabout  the  Legislature’s  formation  of  these  districts, \nthe  reasons  for  their  configuration,  and  the  effects  \nof  their  creation  on  minority  voters.  And  what  its \nexhaustive  review  of  the  evidence  showed  is  that \nTexas’s  motivation  for  its  design  of  CD35,  and  its \nchoice of who was in and who was out of it, was over-\nwhelmingly racial. Further, the State had no cogniz-\nable  compelling  interest  in  creating  CD35.  Travis \nCounty,  the  locus  of  the  State’s principal fine-tuning \nof the district, is the one major area of the State where \nracially polarized voting is legally insignificant. While \nthe requirements of §2 of the Voting Rights Act may \nbe  the  raison  d’etre  for  a  race-based  district,  those \nrequirements are simply absent here. Indeed, far from \nhaving “good reasons” to believe that §2 compelled the \nrace-based configuration of CD35 into Travis County, \nAla. Leg. Black Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, \n1274  (2015),  the  Legislature  was  motivated  by  the \nundisputedly  bad  reason  of  “destroy[ing]  [an]  other-\nwise  effective  crossover  district[]”  where  minorities \nalready  were  electing  their  candidates  of  choice  \nwith  the  help  of  crossover  Anglo  voters,  Bartlett  v. \nStrickland, 556 U.S. 1, 24 (2009).  \n\nSection 2 further provides no refuge for the config-\nuration  of  CD35  where  the  Legislature  knew  it  had \nreadily at hand an alternative place to draw a Latino \nopportunity district where §2 requirements were easily \nmet.  Unlike \nin  Travis  County,  Nueces  County  \nis  home  to  extensive  racially  polarized  voting,  and  a \nsouthward running Latino opportunity district anchored \nin Nueces County would have satisfied the State’s §2 \nobligation. But the State not only refused to take that \nready route, it affirmatively worked to undo the rights \nof Latinos in that part of the state. And it succeeded in \nits objective. For no reason other than to advance the",
        "26 \n\nelection  prospects  of  an  Anglo  incumbent,  it  drew  a \nnew district which by its very design would drown out \nthe  votes  of  the  Latino  voters  who  had  §2  rights.  In \nshort,  the  State  cynically  eliminated  the  §2  rights  of \nLatino voters in one part of the State and ostensibly \nassigned those rights to voters in another part of the \nState  where  §2  required  no  remedy.  The  intentional \nvote  dilution  of  Nueces  County  Latinos  in  CD27  had \nits  desired  effect  and  therefore  violates  §2  from  any \nangle. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  THE  COURT  LACKS  JURISDICTION \n\nOVER THIS APPEAL \n\nThis Court has no jurisdiction to entertain Texas’s \npremature  appeal  because  the  district  court  has  not \nordered  injunctive  relief.  Under  28  U.S.C.  § 1253, \nappeals to this Court from three-judge district courts \nmay only occur “from an order granting or denying . . . \nan interlocutory or permanent injunction.” There has \nbeen no such injunction here, as made clear in both the \norder on appeal, see C.J.S. App. 119a, and the court’s \nsubsequent  order  denying  Texas’s  motion  for  stay \npending  appeal,  see  Dkt.  No.  1538  (Aug.  18,  2017) \n(“Although  the  Court  found  violations  in  Plan  C235, \nthe  Court  has  not  enjoined  its  use  for  any  upcoming \nelections.”) (emphasis added). Under the plain text of \n§ 1253, this Court lacks jurisdiction. \n\nThe  “practical  effects”  test  used  in  Carson  v. \nAmerican  Brands,  Inc.,  450  U.S.  79  (1981),  to  deter-\nmine whether there had been the denial of an injunc-\ntion  for  purposes  of  appealability  under  28  U.S.C.  \n§  1292  is  inapposite  here  for  at  least  three  reasons. \nFirst, the State’s argument not only finds no basis in \nthe plain text of § 1253, it directly contradicts the plain",
        "27 \n\ntext of § 1292, which expressly excludes from its ambit \ninstances  “where  a  direct  review  may  be  had  in  the \nSupreme  Court.”  Second,  grants  of  injunctive  relief \nand denials of injunctive relief are measured by differ-\nent  standards,  the  former  requiring  far  more  detail \nand  precision.  See  Gunn  v.  Univ.  Comm.  to  End  the \nWar in Viet Nam, 399 U.S. 383, 388 (1970) (citing Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(d)). Third, even if the two provisions were \nconstrued  the  same  way,  the  liability  ruling  in  the \ncourt  below  did  not  grant  injunctive  relief  in  any \n“practical” sense where the “practical effect” of what a \nremedy would entail, who it would affect, and when it \nwould be implemented remain, to this day, unknown \nand unknowable. \n\nTo avoid repetition, the Appellees on this brief adopt \nby  reference  the  arguments  made  in  opposition  to \njurisdiction  in  Part  I  of  the  Appellees’  brief  on  state \nlegislative districts, Abbott v. Perez, Case No. 17-626. \n\nII.  THE  2013  LEGISLATIVE \n\nINACTION \nWITH RESPECT TO CDS 27 AND 35 DOES \nNOT  SUPPLANT  THE  2011  LEGISLA-\nTIVE  RECORD  FROM  WHICH  THOSE \nDISTRICTS DERIVED \n\nThe State’s central argument is that “any threat of \ninjury  from  the  2011  redistricting  plans  disappeared \nwhen  the  Legislature  repealed  them.”  Br.  44.  With \nrespect to CDs 27 and 35, this is transparently false. \nWhere  these  two  districts  were  first  placed  by  the \nLegislature when it enacted them in 2011, and where \nthey  have  remained  untouched  ever  since,  voters  \nin  those  districts  have  continued  to  suffer  from  the \nunlawful intent that drove their configuration and the \ndiscriminatory  effects  that  have  persisted  in  every \ncongressional election this decade.",
        "28 \n\nA.  In  2013,  the  Legislature  did  precisely  nothing \nwith respect to CDs 27 and 35. Instead, each and every \ncensus block that was pieced together to form CDs 27 \nand  35  in  2011  was  left  untouched.  Each  and  every \nvoter  who  was  drawn  into  those  districts  in  2011 \nremained  in  those  districts  in  2013.  In  fact,  the  only \nofficial place to find a geographical definition of these \ndistricts  is  in  the  intricacies  of  the  2011  legislation.  \nAct of June 20, 2011, 82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 1, 2011 \nTex.  Gen.  Laws  5091-5180.16  The  2013  redistricting \nbill  does  not  amend  these  districts  in  any  fashion. \nContrary  to  Appellants’  contention,  legislative  inac-\ntion does not magically erase prior legislative intent. \nIf  anything,  a  legislature’s  ratification  of  previous \nactions is nothing more than adoption of them, along \nwith  their  underlying  intentions.  CDs  27  and  35  did \nnot undergo a rebirth in 2013, only a continuation. \n\nAs a practical matter, judicial sanction of the State’s \npurported “make-over” here would invite legislatures \nto  manufacture  new  legislative  records  for  blatantly \ndiscriminatory  laws.  Under  the  State’s  logic,  for \ninstance,  where  a  challenge  to  legislatively  enacted \ndistricts  culminates  in  a  trial  riddled  with  damning \nevidence of discriminatory intent, a legislature could \nsimply  erase  the  record  by  reconvening  before  \na  judicial  ruling  is  entered  and  reenacting  the  same \ndistricts,  this  time  citing  a  purported  effort  to \n“cleanse” the districts of their discriminatory origins, \nor  even  to  “bring  [the]  existing  litigation  to  an  end,” \nBr.  36.  See  C.J.S.  App.  115a  (under  State’s  theory,  \n“a  Legislature  could  always  insulate  itself  from  a \nShaw-type  challenge  simply  by  re-enacting  its  plan \n\n16  As  explained  above,  supra  n.13,  Plan  C235  made  an \ninconsequential change to CD27 by removing a few unpopulated \ncensus blocks.",
        "29 \n\nand claiming that it made no decisions about who to \ninclude  in  the  district  at  the  time  of  re-enactment”). \nThere can be little doubt that, in such circumstances, \nthe  Legislature  would  and  should  be  unable  to \nsupplant  the  original  legislative  record  with  a  newly \nmanufactured  record  that  results  in  purposeful  rein-\nstatement of the status quo. \n\nAs a legal matter, the fact that Plan C235 nominally \nrepealed  Plan  C185  rather  than  amended  it  does  \nnot  provide  legislative  cover  for  those  districts  that \nremained  the  same.  In  Oneida  County  v.  Oneida \nIndian Nation of New York State, 470 U.S. 226 (1985), \nthis  Court  held  that  a  repeal  in  name  only  has  no \nimpact on the substantive provisions that remain the \nsame.  \n\nAlthough there is a formal repeal of the old by \nthe new statute, still there never has been a \nmoment of time since the passage of the [old] \nact  .  .  .  when  these  similar  provisions  have  \nnot been in force. Notwithstanding, therefore, \nthis formal repeal, it is . . . entirely correct to \nsay that the new act should be construed as a \ncontinuation of the old[.] \n\nId. at 246 n.18 (quoting Bear Lake & River Waterworks \n& Irrigation Co. v. Garland, 164 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1896)); \nsee  also  Posadas  v.  Nat’l  City  Bank  of  N.Y.,  296  \nU.S.  497,  505  (1936).  Technical  canons  of  statutory \nconstruction only reinforce application of this principle \nto the statutory provisions at issue here. “[W]hen an \nexisting  statute  is  reenacted  by  a  later  statute  in \nsubstantially  the  same  terms,  .  .  .  [t]he  unchanged \nprovisions  which  are  repeated  in  the  new  enactment \nare  construed  to  have  been  continuously  in  force.”  \n1A Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes \nand Statutory Construction (“Sutherland on Statutory",
        "30 \nConstruction”)  §  23:29  at  542-43  (7th  ed.  2009).  The \nnominal  repeal  of  Plan  C185  in  2013  is  thus  of  no \nmoment  with  respect  to  the  legal  analysis  of  those \ndistricts that have remained in effect since 2011. \n\nIn this situation, the district court properly relied on \nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), to conclude \nthat the portions of the 2011 plan the court found had \nbeen  drawn  with  an  impermissible  motive  “remain \nunlawful”  if  “those  lines  remain  unchanged”  in  Plan \nC235 because the “discrimination continues to have its \nintended effect.” C.J.S. App. 35a. Appellants’ attempt \nto distinguish Hunter, see Br. 32; U.S. Br. 33, rests on \nthe same flawed premise that the Legislature actually \ntook  action  on  CDs  27  and  35  in  2013—which  it  did \nnot.  Hunter  was  unequivocal  on  the  constitutional  \nrule  that  governs  analysis  of  CDs  27  and  35  here:  If \nthe  “original  enactment  was  motivated  by”  invidious \ndiscriminatory  intent  “and  the  section  continues  to \nthis day to have that effect,” it violates equal protec-\ntion  under  the  test  laid  down  in  Village  of  Arlington \nHeights  v.  Metropolitan  Housing  Development  Corp., \n429 U.S. 252 (1977). Hunter, 471 U.S. at 233. \n\nThis  case  is  indistinguishable.  At  the  beginning  of \nthe decade, Texas enacted a redistricting plan riddled \nwith discriminatory intent. While judicial intervention \nmitigated  some  of  the  discriminatory  effect  flowing \nfrom that improper intent, acquiescing to that limited \nand preliminary judicial intervention by enacting Plan \nC235’s  changes  to  the  DFW  districts  and  CD23  does \nnot erase the intent with which CDs 27 and 35 were \nenacted or do anything to ameliorate how that intent",
        "31 \n\ncontinued to produce the same effect in those districts \nin 2013 and beyond.17 \n\nThe State’s insistence that any analysis of the dis-\ntricts as drawn in 2011 is moot thus strains credulity \nin  light  of  the  fact  that  CDs  27  and  35  have  been \n“continuously  in  force”  since  2011.  Sutherland  on \nStatutory Construction § 23:29 at 542-43. A challenged \nstatute does not become moot just because it is volun-\ntarily repealed (and reenacted, unchanged) in the mid-\ndle of a lawsuit. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, \nInc., 455 U.S. 283, 288-89 n.10 (1982). Here, the Legis-\nlature not only left open the possibility that it might \nreenact  the  2011  redistricting  statute,  it  effectively \ndid reenact—or more precisely, “ratify”—that statute \nwith  respect  to  the  only  districts  at  issue  in  this \nappeal.  See  Ne.  Fla.  Chapter  of  Associated  Gen. \nContractors  of  Am.  v.  City  of  Jacksonville,  508  U.S. \n656,  662  (1993)  (“There  is  no  mere  risk  that \nJacksonville will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; \nit has already done so.”); id. at 662 n.3 (controversy is \nnot mooted where a new statute is “sufficiently similar \nto the repealed [statute] that it is permissible to say \nthat the challenged conduct continues”).  \n\n17  Indeed,  the State’s  contention  that  the  reenactment  of the \nidentical  configurations  of  CDs  27  and  35  in  2013  saved  the \ndistricts  from  invalidity  under  the  Constitution  and  Voting \nRights Act is refuted by this Court’s interpretation of the Voting \nRights Act itself. In Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, 520 U.S. \n471 (1997), this Court was faced with an argument that the 1982 \nrenewal of §5 changed a prior interpretation of the Act’s reach. \nThe  Court  rejected  the  argument  on  the  ground  that  not \namending the statute does not constitute a change in the way the \nstatute should be interpreted. “Quite obviously, reenacting pre-\ncisely  the  same  language  would  be  a  strange  way  to  make  a \nchange.” Id. at 484 (quoting Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, \n567 (1988)).",
        "32 \n\nB.  Nor  can  the  State  seek  refuge  in  the  district \ncourt’s  purported  “blessing”  of  CDs  27  and  35  in  its \n2012 interim plan order. The State’s defense is unpre-\ncedented,  boiling  down  to  this  putative  rule:  a  legis-\nlature  that  successfully  masks  its  discriminatory \nmotives  during  preliminary  injunction  proceedings \ncan  permanently  erase  a  discriminatory  legislative \nrecord  by  simply  repealing  and  reenacting  its  law—\nshifting  the  responsibility  for  its  creation  from  the \nlegislature to the court.  \n\nAmple authority shows the opposite to be true. The \nCourt  only  recently  explained  the  characteristics  of \npreliminary  rulings  in  terms  contradicting  Texas’s \nargument: \n\nCrafting a preliminary injunction is an exer-\ncise of discretion and judgment, often depend-\nent as much on the equities of a given case as \nthe substance of the legal issues it presents. \nThe  purpose  of  such  interim  equitable  relief \nis  not  to  conclusively  determine  the  rights  of \nthe parties, but to balance the equities as the \nlitigation moves forward. \n\nTrump  v.  Int’l  Refugee  Assistance  Project,  137  S.  Ct. \n2080, 2087 (2017) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \nThis  echoes  decades  of  precedent  establishing  that  a \npreliminary injunction ruling has limited significance \nfor the ultimate disposition of a claim. \n\nThe  purpose  of  a  preliminary  injunction  is \nmerely  to  preserve  the  relative  positions  of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be \nheld.  Given  this  limited  purpose,  and  given \nthe  haste  that  is  often  necessary  if  those \npositions  are  to  be  preserved,  a  preliminary \ninjunction is customarily granted on the basis",
        "33 \n\nof  procedures  that  are  less  formal  and \nevidence that is less complete than in a trial \non  the  merits.  A  party  thus  is  not  required  \nto  prove  his  case  in  full  at  a  preliminary \ninjunction  hearing,  and  the  findings  of  fact \nand conclusions of law made by a court grant-\ning a preliminary injunction are not binding \nat trial on the merits. \n\nUniv. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) \n(citations  omitted);  see  also  Walters  v.  Nat’l  Ass’n  of \nRadiation  Survivors,  473  U.S.  305,  317  (1985)  (“any \nconclusions  reached  at  the  preliminary  injunction \nstage  are  subject  to  revision”).  The  State’s  gambit  of \nclaiming safe harbor in the district court’s preliminary \nruling “improperly equates ‘likelihood of success’ with \n‘success,’  and  .  .  .  more  important  .  .  .  ignores  the \nsignificant  procedural  differences  between  prelimi-\nnary  and  permanent  injunctions.”  Camenisch,  451 \nU.S. at 394. \n\nThe  State  can  hardly  feign  surprise  that  prelimi-\nnary  court  rulings  cannot  be  used  to  justify  the \nreenactment  of  identical  districts.  Not  only  did  the \nLegislature’s  own  lawyer  caution  against  this  shell-\ngame strategy for hiding the State’s unconstitutional \nconduct in 2013, but also the district court expressly \ntold  Texas  that  its  interim  ruling  was  “not  a  final \nruling  on  the  merits  of  any  claims  asserted  by  the \nPlaintiffs  in  this  case.”  C.J.S.  App.  367a.  The  State  \nhad no basis to believe the §2 and constitutional issues \nhad  been  fully  addressed  or  finally  resolved  where  \nthe district court had cited a variety of “difficult and \nunsettled  legal  issues  as  well  as  numerous  factual \ndisputes”  that  were  made  all  the  more  “difficult  to \ndetermine” in light of the “necessarily expedited and",
        "34 \ncurtailed”  time  frame  for  analysis.  Id.  367a-368a.18 \nThe  district  court’s  repeated  caveats,  moreover,  that \nthe  interim  plan  was  acceptable  only  to  the  extent  it \nwas  interim  provided  the  Legislature  no  excuse  for \navoiding a considered analysis of its own and cement-\ning CDs 27 and 35 for the remainder of the decade.19 \n\nIn  short,  the  State’s  boast  that  it  simply  “took  the \ncourt at its word,” Br. 2, is an empty one. The district \ncourt’s  “word”  to  Texas  was  that  the  interim  plan \nruling  contained  only  “preliminary  determinations” \nfor  one  election  cycle  that  “may  be  revised  upon  full \nanalysis.”  C.J.S.  App.  367a-68a.  The  State  paid  no \nheed. \n\nThis  Court  should  not  sanction  the  State’s  gaming \nof  the  judicial  process.  The  Legislature’s  inaction  in \n2013 with respect to CDs 27 and 35 left those district \nlines,  and  the  circumstances  of  their  origin,  in  full \nforce  and  effect.  Accordingly,  the  district  court  pro-\nperly grounded its analysis of the districts in the 2011 \nredistricting process.20 \n\n18 Indeed, the only federal court that had carefully considered \nthe  legality  of  the  original  plan  found  rampant  discriminatory \nintent planwide. Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d at 159, \n161 & n.32. \n\n19 See, e.g., C.J.S. App. 417a (“For purposes of an interim plan, \nthe Court concludes that C235 adequately addresses the claims \nrelating  to  the  Central  Texas  districts.”)  (emphasis  added);  id. \n423a (deeming Plan C235 “an appropriate interim plan”); id. 368a \n(“accept[ing]  the  compromise  plan”  because  it  “would  signifi-\ncantly  benefit  the  voters,  candidates,  election  administrators, \ncounties, and political parties” for the 2012 elections). \n\n20 Even were the Court to determine that the proper focus of \nthe questions of motive, intent, and purpose is the action of the \n2013  Legislature  instead  of  the  2011  Legislature,  the  district \ncourt unanimously found that the 2013 Legislature displayed the",
        "35 \n\nIII.  CD35  HAS  BEEN  A  RACIAL  GERRY-\nMANDER EVER SINCE IT WAS DRAWN \nIN 2011 \n\nThe  district  court  struck  down  CD35  as  a  racial \ngerrymander  in  violation  of  the  Equal  Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In accordance \nwith  this  Court’s  precedent,  it  found  that  race  pre-\ndominated  over  traditional  districting  principles  in \n“the drawing of district lines and selection of district \npopulation”  in  CD35,  C.J.S.  App.  166a,  which  main-\ntained  the  “exact  same  configuration”  in  Plans  C185 \nand  C235,  id.  113a.  The  court  further  concluded  \nthat the Legislature’s race-based redistricting of CD35 \nwas  not  tailored  to  a  compelling  state  interest; \nmapdrawers set out “not to substantially address the \n§ 2 requirement, but to use race as a tool for partisan \ngoals.”  Id.  110a.  The  district  court’s  assessment  of \nCD35 in accordance with the “two-step” racial gerry-\nmandering inquiry “warrants significant deference on \nappeal to this Court.” Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464.21  \n\ninvidious  intent  and  dominant  motive  necessary  to  invalidate \nCDs 27 and 35. Its findings are not clearly erroneous and should \nnot be overturned by the Court. The Appellees on this brief adopt \nby reference the arguments made on this point in Part II.B of the \nAppellees’ brief on state legislative districts, Abbott v. Perez, Case \nNo. 17-626. \n\n21  The  district  court’s  racial  gerrymandering  finding  did  not \nhinge  on  the  State’s  discriminatory  intent.  The  district  court \ncorrectly noted that “[d]iscriminatory purpose is not an element \nof a Shaw-type claim.” C.J.S. App. 37a n.36 (referring to Shaw v. \nReno,  509  U.S.  630  (1993));  see  also  id.  164a  n.31  (“The  harm \nflows  from  being  ‘personally  .  .  .  subjected  to  [a]  racial \nclassification,’  not  from  vote  dilution  or  intentional  discrimina-\ntion.”) (quoting Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1265); Covington v. North \nCarolina, 316 F.R.D. 117, 124 n.1 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (“In reaching \nthis  conclusion  [that  race  predominated],  we  make  no  finding",
        "36 \n\nTexas does not even attempt an argument that race \ndid  not  predominate  in  the  actual  line  drawing  of \nCD35  or  that  the  district  court’s  extensive  factual \nfindings on this score are clear error. For good reason: \nthe evidence of racial predominance in the selection of \npopulation within and without CD35 is overwhelming.  \n\nThe  district  court  found  that  nearly  every  tradi-\ntional districting principle in CD35 was subordinated \nto  race.  In  Travis  County,  the  lines  were  drawn  in \ncomplete  disregard  of  city  boundaries,  state  House \ndistrict  boundaries,  and  “any  other  recognizable \ncommunities of interest other than race.” C.J.S. App. \n168a; Supp. App. 320. Race subordinated party vote—\nby a factor of two—in the shuffling of voting tabulation \ndistricts  in  the  five  new  congressional  districts  tat-\ntooed onto Travis County. Supp. App. 337a. Precincts \nwere split to lasso the heavily-Latino dorms of a local \nCatholic university into CD35, apart from the rest of \nthe school, and to send an “arrowhead” extension into \nnorthern  parts  of  Austin  to  bring  Latino  apartment \nrenters  into  a  district  running  along  the  interstate \nthen looping into the south side of San Antonio eighty \nmiles  away.  C.J.S.  App.  167a;  see  Bush  v.  Vera,  517 \n\nthat  the  General  Assembly  acted  in  bad  faith  or  with  dis-\ncriminatory intent in drawing the challenged districts[.]”), aff’d, \n137 S. Ct. 2211 (2017). That analysis comports with this Court’s \narticulation  of  the  racial  predominance  standard  as  one  which \nexamines  the  use  of  race  in  the  placement  of  voters  in  various \ndistricts.  Alabama,  135  S.  Ct.  at  1271  (“[T]he  ‘predominance’ \nquestion concerns which voters the legislature decides to choose, \nand specifically whether the legislature predominantly uses race \nas opposed to other, ‘traditional’ factors when doing so.”); see also \nMiller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). It is the race-based \nplacement of voters without a strong basis in evidence for doing \nso, rather than any intent to discriminate through vote dilution, \nthat defines a Shaw claim.",
        "37 \n\nU.S.  952,  970-71  (1996)  (“split[]  voter  tabulation \ndistricts”  provide  “objective  evidence”  of  racial  pre-\ndominance since “the districting software used by the \nState  provided  only  racial  data  at  the  block-by-block \nlevel”). \n\nNor were these deviations from traditional district-\ning  criteria  limited  to  the  north  half  of  CD35.  See \nC.J.S.  App.  170a  n.36  (district  court’s  “finding  that \nrace predominated in the drawing of [CD35] applies to \nthe district as a whole”). Race was similarly the basis \nfor  selecting  voters  in  Bexar  County,  where,  after \nsnaking  south  along  the  interstate,  CD35  first \nnarrows  in  low-density  Latino  areas  then  widens  to \nembrace  the  large  Latino  community  in  South  San \nAntonio.  Id.  169a.  Along  the  way,  county  and  small \ncity  boundaries  gave  way  to  race.  Supp.  App.  328a-\n29a;  C.J.S.  App.  170a.  The  end  result  of  this  race-\nbased  carving  of  voters  from  north  central  Austin  to \nthe south side of San Antonio is a district that remains \nthe  least  compact  congressional  district  in  the  state. \nSupp. App. 339a; see also C.J.S. App. 162a-63a.  \n\nWhere,  as  here,  race  predominates,  the  burden \nshifts  to  the  State  to  demonstrate  that  the  district’s \nconfiguration  was  narrowly  tailored  to  a  compelling \ngovernment interest. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464. Based \non  all  available  evidence,  the  district  court  rightly \nconcluded  that  Texas  had  not  satisfied  its  strict \nscrutiny  burden  with  respect  to  CD35.  While  Texas \nleaned on §2 of the Voting Rights Act to justify its race-\nbased  redistricting  of  CD35,  the  district  court  found \nnot only that CD35 was not “actually . . . necessary” to \navoid a §2 violation, Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1274, but \nalso that the Legislature had “no reasonable basis” for \nbelieving it was, Supp. App. 340a.",
        "38 \n\nThe  district  court  found—and  Texas  does  not \ndispute—that  “the  third  Gingles  precondition  is  not \npresent in a significant portion of the district,” namely \nTravis  County.  C.J.S.  App.  175a.  See  Thornburg  \nv.  Gingles,  478  U.S.  30,  51  (1986)  (requiring  as  \nprecondition  for  §2  liability  that  “the  white  majority \nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to \ndefeat  the  minority’s  preferred  candidate”).  Unlike \nmost  other  areas  of  Texas,  “Travis  County  does  not \nhave  Anglo  bloc  voting.”  C.J.S.  App.  110a.  Rather, \nTravis  County  Anglos  lack  cohesion  and  split  their \nvote, Supp. App. 308a, and therefore “do not vote as a \nbloc  against  the  minority-preferred  candidates.”  Id. \n340a.  African-American  and  Latino  voters  in  Travis \nCounty “have the ability to elect their preferred candi-\ndates  precisely  because  Anglo  voters  vote  at  suffi-\nciently high rates for minority-preferred candidates.” \nId. Without evidence that racial bloc voting compelled \nthe extension of CD35 into Travis County, Texas’s §2 \njustification falls flat.22 \n\nThe  district  court  further  found  that  “mapdrawers \nknew”  that  the  third  Gingles  precondition  was  not \nsatisfied in Travis County. C.J.S. App. 110a (emphasis \nadded). To be sure, “[t]here is no indication that [the \nmapdrawer]  had  any  evidence,  much  less  a  strong \nbasis  in  evidence,  to  support  the  inclusion  of  Travis \nCounty in the new §2 district when he decided to place \n\n22 While the district court was “inclined to find that CD35 is \nnot compact for §2 purposes,” it deferred the issue since the third \nGingles precondition was found lacking. C.J.S. App. 175a. Indeed, \nthe mapdrawer himself believed that CD35 was “borderline” on \nthe compactness scale and “had his doubts that the district was \nrequired by § 2,” C.J.S. App. 162a, and the State’s own experts \ntestified that CD35 is “definitely not a compact district” and “not \n‘compelling from a Section 2 standpoint,’” id. 162a-63a & n.30.",
        "39 \n\na  district  there.”  Id.  179a  n.46.  Nor  was  there  any \nevidence “that any member of the Legislature, includ-\ning Chairmen Solomons and Seliger, had any basis in \nevidence for believing that CD35 was required by § 2 \nother than its HCVAP-majority status.” Id.; see also id. \n(mapdrawer “repeatedly testified that his sole criteria \nfor  a  §  2  district  was  whether  it  was  above  50% \nHCVAP”);  id.  178a  (“There  is  no  indication  that \nmapdrawers or the Legislature drew CD35 in Travis \nCounty  because  they  felt  that  Hispanic  voters  there \nhad  a  §  2  right  that  needed  a  remedy.”).  The  State \ncannot now seek refuge in §2 where its configuration \nof CD35 was not even informed by, let alone grounded \nin, an inquiry into §2 requirements. See Shaw v. Hunt \n(“Shaw  II”),  517  U.S.  899,  908  n.4  (1996)  (“To  be  a \ncompelling  interest,  the  State  must  show  that  the \nalleged objective was the legislature’s ‘actual purpose’ \nfor  the  discriminatory  classification,  and  the  legisla-\nture  must  have  had  a  strong  basis  in  evidence  to \nsupport  that  justification  before  it  implements  the \nclassification.”)  (citation  omitted).  The  State’s  willful \nfailure to examine even minimally the critical issue of \nracial bloc voting for purposes of assessing potential §2 \nliability falls far short of its strict scrutiny burden to \nestablish  narrow  tailoring.  See  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at \n1472 (refusing to “approve a racial gerrymander whose \nnecessity is supported by no evidence”). \n\nIn  fact,  the  district  court  found  as  a  fact  that  the \n“actual  purpose”  of  Texas’s  race-based  drawing  of \nCD35 was never based on a legislative belief that §2 \nrequired  its  configuration,  but,  rather,  on  the  race-\nbased  carve-up  of  Travis  County  and  dismantlement \nof the existing crossover district there. \n\n[T]hey  drew  CD35  as  an  HCVAP-majority \ndistrict that extended into Travis County for",
        "40 \n\nthe  purpose  of  eliminating  the  existing  dis-\ntrict  [CD25]  in  which  minorities  and  Anglos \ntogether elected a Democratic candidate (and \nto  unseat  that  candidate).  In  this  way,  they \nwere  able  to  create  the  facade  of  complying \nwith  §  2  while  actually  minimizing  the \nnumber of districts in which minorities could \nelect  their  candidates  of  choice  despite  the \nmassive minority population growth that had \noccurred throughout the state. \n\nC.J.S. App. 178a; see also id. 110a. This finding is fully \nsupported by the record. See Cooper, 137 S.Ct. at 1465 \n(district court’s findings of fact “are subject to review \nonly for clear error”). The Legislature decided in advance \nthat  any  new  minority  opportunity  district  in  Texas \nhad to yield a net gain of three Republican seats. Supp. \nApp. 439a. “Although [the mapdrawer] could have drawn \na new central Texas Latino opportunity district with-\nout  including  Travis  County  or  disrupting  CD25,  he \nchose this configuration to ensure a 3-1 map.” C.J.S. \nApp. 440a. Thus, the district court concluded, “[a]lthough \na  new  Latino  opportunity  district  was  required  in \nSouth and West Texas, . . . mapdrawers’ placement of \nsignificant population from Travis County into CD35 \nwas not to substantially address the §2 requirement, \nbut to use race as a tool for partisan goals.” Id. 110a.23 \n\n23 To be sure, the State has no compelling interest in achieving \nracially invidious objectives by purposely destroying a crossover \ndistrict. Shortly before this decade’s redistricting cycle, this Court \nadmonished states against such constitutionally suspect conduct. \nSee Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 24 (a showing that a state “intentionally \ndrew  district  lines  in  order  to  destroy  otherwise  effective \ncrossover  districts”  would  “raise  serious  questions”  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment). The district court discussed the consti-\ntutional  problem  with  the  deliberate  destruction  of  the  Travis \nCounty-based crossover district but refrained from directly ruling",
        "41 \n\nThe State’s principal argument in defense of CD35’s \nrace-based  configuration  is  that  the  district  court’s \ninterim map did not alter it. Br. 45-46. But as set forth \nabove, supra Part II, Texas’s decision to maintain the \nstatus  quo  in  CD35  by  doing  nothing  at  all  in  2013 \ncannot  replace  the  actual  decisions  made  when  the \nactual  lines  were  drawn  by  the  Legislature  in  2011.  \nSee  also  C.J.S.  App.  115a.  The  district  court’s  2012 \npreliminary  inquiry,  moreover,  can  hardly  be  the \njustification for the State’s action where that inquiry \nshifted  the  strict  scrutiny  burden  to  Appellees.  The \ncourt  asked  whether  Appellees  had  “demonstrated  a \nsubstantial  likelihood  that  CD35  would  fail  a  strict \nscrutiny  analysis  if  strict  scrutiny  applies,”  id.  415a, \nnot whether the State would meet its burden to satisfy \nstrict  scrutiny.  Texas’s  glib  contention  that  “[i]f  the \ndistrict court had ‘good reasons’ to believe that CD35 \nneeded to be drawn as a minority-opportunity district \nto  address  potential  VRA  §2  claims,  then  surely  the \nLegislature  did  too,”  Br.  48,  improperly  equates  the \ndistrict  court’s  standard  of  review  under  Perry  with \nthe  State’s  more  exacting  standard  under  strict \nscrutiny.24 \n\non the question because its finding that CD35 is a racial gerry-\nmander would necessitate reconfiguring the area anyway. C.J.S. \nApp. 111a n.83, 172a n.38. Nonetheless, the intentional destruc-\ntion  of  benchmark  CD25  under  the  Bartlett  constitutional  test \noffers  an  alternative  basis  for  invalidating  Plan  C235’s  racial \ncarve-up of Travis County.  \n\n24 Even if the 2013 Legislature’s motivations were relevant, the \ndistrict  court  specifically  warned  the  State  not  to  rely  on  its \n“preliminary  determinations.”  C.J.S.  App.  367a.  The  abundant \ncaveats accompanying the interim plan provided Texas no legal \nor factual basis, let alone a “strong basis in evidence,” Alabama, \n135  S.  Ct.  at  1274,  to  believe  that  §2  required  CD35’s \nconfiguration.",
        "42 \n\nThe  State’s  only  substantive  argument  on  strict \nscrutiny  is  that  §2  required  the  creation  of  seven \nLatino opportunity districts in south/west Texas. But \nwhile the Legislature “may have had a strong basis in \nevidence for believing” this undisputed fact, it “had no \nbasis  in  evidence  to  believe  that  the  Gingles  precon-\nditions  were  satisfied  in  Travis  County  such  that  \na  race-based  majority-Hispanic  district  should  be  \ndrawn there.” C.J.S. App. 176a. The mere fact that §2 \nrequired  the  creation  of  seven  Latino  opportunity \ndistricts  does  not  give  the  State  license  to  “draw  a \nmajority-minority district anywhere,” even where the \nGingles  preconditions  are  not  present.  Shaw  II,  517 \nU.S. at 916. The inclusion of Travis County “would not \naddress  the  professed  interest  of  relieving  the  vote \ndilution, much less be narrowly tailored to accomplish \nthe goal.” Id. at 917. \n\nAs  detailed  above,  the  mapdrawers  knew  full  well \nthat seven majority-minority districts could be drawn \nin the region—in satisfaction of §2—without the race-\nbased carving of Travis County and the destruction of \nbenchmark  CD25.  C.J.S.  App.  181a  n.47.  Like  the \ndistrict court, this Court should reject Texas’s invita-\ntion to bless its drawing of any old race-based district \nin any old configuration in purported service of §2. The \nquestion before the Court is not whether the State had \ngood reasons to believe that §2 required seven Latino \nopportunity  districts  in  south/west  Texas,  “one  of \nwhich  was  CD35,”  Br.  47,  but  rather  whether  the \nlegislature had good reasons to believe “that the race-\nbased calculus it employed in [CD35] was necessary to \navoid  violating”  §2,  Bethune-Hill  v.  Va.  State  Bd.  of \nElections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 801 (2017); see also Cooper, \n137 S. Ct. at 1469 (“race-based districting is narrowly \ntailored”  to  Voting  Rights  Act  compliance  “if  a  State",
        "43 \n\nhad ‘good reasons’ for thinking that the Act demanded \nsuch steps”).  \n\nIn its recent strict scrutiny analysis in Cooper, this \nCourt  rejected  the  State’s  proposed  unconstrained \napproach  to  drawing  majority-minority  districts  in \npurported service of §2. There this Court affirmed the \nlower court’s finding that the State of North Carolina \nhad  no  basis  for  revamping  an  existing  crossover \ndistrict in ostensible service to §2 requirements where \nevidence of the third Gingles precondition was lacking. \n137  S.  Ct.  at  1470.  Similarly  here,  the  State  had  no \nreason to think that §2 required it to draw CD35 all \nthe way into Travis County, where the Anglo popula-\ntion  “did  not  ‘vote[]  sufficiently  as  a  bloc’  to  thwart \n[minority]  voters’  preference,”  id.  (quoting  Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 51), and dismantle the existing crossover \ndistrict CD25. In short, “experience gave the State no \nreason  to  think”  that  §2  required  Travis  County \nLatinos to be drawn out of their preexisting crossover \ndistrict and into a new majority-minority district. Id. \n\nIndeed,  just  as  North  Carolina  pursued  a  single-\nminded  focus  on  achieving  50  percent  minority  VAP \nwithout  reference  to  the  third  Gingles  precondition, \nsee id. at 1472, Texas mapdrawers pursued a single-\nminded focus on achieving 50 percent HCVAP in CD35 \nwithout  regard  to  the  presence  of  Anglo  bloc  voting, \nC.J.S.  App.  179a  n.45.  The  incidence  of  racial  bloc \nvoting  in  some  areas  of  south/west  Texas  does  not \nsupport the State’s avowed need to extend CD35 into \nTravis  County  to  avoid  §2  liability.  This  Court  has \nconsistently rejected—and should once again reject—\nthe misguided notion that because there is racial bloc \nvoting  somewhere,  the  State  can  draw  a  §2  remedy \nanywhere.",
        "44 \n\nTexas cannot take advantage of either its procedural \nmaneuvers or §2 to justify its race-based configuration \nof CD35. The voters of CD35 have cast ballots in this \nunconstitutional district in every election this decade. \nThis Court should affirm the district court’s invalida-\ntion of CD35 as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.  \n\nIV.  CD27 HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS \n\nIN VIOLATION OF §2 \n\nThe  district  court  expressly  found  that  “the \nLegislature violated §2 in both result and intent” in its \nconfiguration  of  CD27.  C.J.S.  App.  112a  (emphasis \nadded).  The  State  provides  no  basis  for  overturning \neither finding. While the State points to other possible \nexplanations  for  the  Legislature’s  decision  to  excise \nNueces  County  Latinos  from  the  majority-minority \ndistrict they enjoyed for over 25 years, it cannot escape \nthe  testimony  from  its  own  witnesses  affirming  the \nprimary  intent  to  protect  the  Anglo  incumbent  by \ndrowning out the votes of Nueces County Latinos. The \nState’s myopic focus on its creation of seven majority-\nminority  districts  in  purported  satisfaction  of  §2, \nmoreover, falls away in the face of the unlawful racial \ngerrymander  of  CD35  and  ignores  this  Court’s  well-\nestablished rule that a state cannot skirt the §2 rights \nof minority voters by substituting in a new opportunity \ndistrict where §2 does not require it. \n\nA.  CD27 Intentionally Dilutes the Vote of \n\nNueces County Latinos \n\nThe district court’s findings lifted the veil from the \nState’s  defense  of  what  it  did  to  the  nearly  quarter \nmillion  Latino  voters  in  Nueces  County.  As  detailed \nabove,  while  voting  in  the  county  is  highly  racially \npolarized,  Latinos  there  had  had  the  opportunity  for",
        "45 \n\nmore  than  a  quarter  century  to  elect  their  congres-\nsional  candidates  of  choice.  But  the  Legislature \ndeliberately and cynically eliminated that ability, and \nintentionally  diluted  the  votes  of  Nueces  Latinos,  by \nstranding  them  in  the  new  Anglo-dominated  district \nwhere  they  lost  their  voting  rights  opportunity.  The \nevidence showed that this was by legislative design “to \nprotect  an  incumbent  who  was  not  the  candidate  of \nchoice of those Latino voters.” C.J.S. 191a. \n\nThe court based its finding on a meticulous exami-\nnation of the extensive trial evidence, including testi-\nmony  from  the  mapdrawers  themselves.  See  Supp. \nApp. 287a-300a; C.J.S. App. 191a-92a. The mapdraw-\ners  were  well  aware  that  Representative  Farenthold \nwould likely not survive reelection in majority-Latino \nbenchmark  CD27,  so  they  reoriented  the  district  to \npave  the  way  to  his  victory  and  ensure  defeat  of  the \nLatino-preferred candidate. In the Legislature’s view, \nthe long-acknowledged voting rights of Nueces County \nLatinos  had  to  be  sacrificed  because  they  voted  the \nwrong  way.  See  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  440 \n(2006)  (“In  essence  the  State  took  away  the  Latinos’ \nopportunity because Latinos were about to exercise it. \nThis bears the mark of intentional discrimination[.]”). \n\nThe  State  does  not  even  attempt  to  justify  the \nLegislature’s  decision  to  carve  out  Nueces  County \nLatinos from their previous majority-minority district \nin  service  of  Farenthold’s  reelection.  To  be  sure,  this \nCourt has already rejected the State of Texas’s argu-\nment  that  vote  dilution  is  an  acceptable  means  of \nincumbency protection. See LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. \nat 440-41. Over a decade ago, Texas argued that the \nreason  for  excising  Latino  voters  from  CD23  was  to \nprotect the incumbent “from a constituency that was \nincreasingly  voting  against  him.”  Id.  at  440.  This",
        "46 \n\nCourt clarified that incumbency protection may not be \npursued at all costs. \n\nIf the justification for incumbency protection \nis  to  keep  the  constituency  intact  so  the \nofficeholder is accountable for promises made \nor broken, then the protection seems to accord \nwith  concern  for  the  voters.  If,  on  the  other \nhand,  incumbency  protection  means  exclud-\ning  some  voters  from  the  district  simply \nbecause  they  are  likely  to  vote  against  the \nofficeholder,  the  change  is  to  benefit  the \nofficeholder,  not  the  voters.  By  purposely \nredrawing  lines  around  those  who  opposed \n[the  incumbent],  the  state  legislature  took  \nthe  latter  course.  This  policy,  whatever  its \nvalidity in the realm of politics, cannot justify \nthe effect on Latino voters. \n\nId.  at  441.  Indeed,  similar  to  LULAC  v.  Perry,  the \nlegislative  policy  here  “becomes  even  more  suspect,” \nid., when considered in light of the evidence that the \nState “replaced” CD27 with CD35 in purported satis-\nfaction  of  §2  knowing  full  well  that  the  contorted \nextension  into  Travis  County  had  no  §2  basis.  See \nsupra  Part  III;  C.J.S.  App.  178a  (“In  this  way,  they \nwere  able  to  create  the  facade  of  complying  with  §2 \nwhile  actually  minimizing  the  number  of  districts  in \nwhich minorities could elect their candidates of choice \ndespite the massive minority population growth that \nhad occurred throughout the state.”); LULAC v. Perry, \n548 U.S. at 441 (“This use of race to create the facade \nof a Latino district also weighs in favor of appellants’ \nclaim.”).  \n\nNotwithstanding the testimony from the mapdraw-\ners,  the  State  contends  that  the  real  motivation  for \nincluding Nueces County in majority-Anglo CD27 was",
        "47 \n\n“to  keep  Nueces  County  whole  as  the  anchor  of  a \ncongressional  district”  while  establishing  a  new  dis-\ntrict  anchored  in  Cameron  County.  Br.  51,  53.25  In \nparticular,  the  State  points  to  “hearings  held  before \nthe  2011  legislative  session”  as  the  source  for  the \nreorientation  of  Nueces  County  and  the  concomitant \nelectoral  isolation  of  its  206,000  Latino  residents.  \nBr. 51. But the district court pored over the abundant \ntestimony  from  those  hearings  and  found  significant \ninconsistencies with both the State’s proffered expla-\nnation  and  the  resulting  map.  See  Supp.  App.  295a. \nIndeed, “no one suggested” that Nueces County should \nbe  grouped  with  the  host  of  majority-Anglo  counties  \nto its north, id., yet that is precisely the configuration \nthe  mapdrawers  chose—and  precisely  the  means  of \ndiluting  the  vote  of  Nueces  County  Latinos.  C.J.S. \nApp. 189a-190a.  \n\nThe State’s contention that it was driven by a desire \nfor Nueces County to anchor a district is further belied \nby the actual configuration and performance of CD27. \nWhile  Nueces  County  voters  controlled  the  outcome  \nof  CD27  elections  in  the  benchmark  plan,  see  Supp. \n\n25  The  State’s  citation  to  Personnel  Administrator  of \nMassachusetts v. Feeney as the governing standard for discrim-\ninatory intent conveniently omits two important qualifiers. First, \nthe  Feeney  test  asks  whether  the  government  decision  was  “at \nleast  in  part  ‘because  of’”  its  adverse  effects  on  an  identifiable \ngroup. 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979) (emphasis added). Feeney further \nnotes  that  when  the  adverse  consequences  of  the  law  at  issue  \non  an  identifiable  group—here,  minority  voters—are  virtually \ninevitable,  “a  strong  inference  that  the  adverse  effects  were \ndesired  can  reasonably  be  drawn.”  Id.  at  279  n.25.  Where  the \nState  equated  minorities  with  Democrats,  and  then  used  the \ndivision of minority communities as the tool to harm Democrats, \nthe inference is unavoidable that the adverse effects on minorities \nalso were intended.",
        "48 \n\nApp.  296a  (“In  benchmark  CD27,  Nueces  County’s \nregistered  voters  made  up  just  over  50%  of  the  total \nregistered  voters.”);  Rod.  Ex.  955  (63.3  percent  of  \nvotes cast in 2010 general election in benchmark CD27 \nwere from Nueces County), Nueces County voters lost \ncontrol of the election once the district was reoriented \nto include “twelve heavily Anglo Central Texas coun-\nties,”  Supp.  App.  294a,  296a  (“In  new  CD27,  Nueces \nCounty voters are no longer the majority of registered \nvoters  in  the  district.”);  Rod.  Ex.  956  (65.1  percent  \nof  votes  cast  in  2012  general  election  in  CD27  were \nfrom outside Nueces County). Indeed, the mapdrawers  \n“did no analysis to see whether Nueces County could \ncontrol the election in the new CD27 and did not know \nif it could.” Supp. App. 296a. The fact that mapdrawers \nmanaged  to  fail  in  meeting  what  the  State  now \nproffers  as  the  main  goal  driving  CD27  reveals  the \npretextual nature of that claim.26 \n\nThe  State’s  alternative  explanation  for  the  con-\nfiguration  of  CD27  was  thoroughly  considered  and \nultimately  rejected  by  the  district  court.  C.J.S.  App. \n193a. Even if the State’s argument found some support \nin the record, the State provides this Court no basis for \nfinding “clear error.” See Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1465 (“A \nfinding that is ‘plausible’ in light of the full record—\neven if another is equally or more so—must govern.”) \n(quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575 \n\n26  The  State’s  contention  that  there  were  other  ways  “a \nnefarious  mapdrawer”  could  have  diluted  the  vote  of  Nueces \nCounty  Latinos  hardly  exonerates  it  for  choosing  its  preferred \nmethod of vote dilution. Br. 53. The dilution of minority voting \nstrength  “may  be  caused  by  the  dispersal  of  [Latinos]  into  dis-\ntricts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters,” \nas was done in CD27, “or from the concentration of [Latinos] into \ndistricts  where  they  constitute  an  excessive  majority.”  Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 46 n.11 (emphasis added).",
        "49 \n\n(1985)); see also Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74 (“If the \ndistrict court’s account of the evidence is plausible in \nlight of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of \nappeals may not reverse it even though convinced that \nhad  it  been  sitting  as  the  trier  of  fact,  it  would  have \nweighed the evidence differently. Where there are two \npermissible  views  of  the  evidence,  the  factfinder’s \nchoice  between  them  cannot  be  clearly  erroneous.”). \nThis  longstanding  rule  of  deference  is  surely  applic-\nable  here,  where  the  district  court’s  ultimate  conclu-\nsion of discriminatory intent came after it heard weeks \nof  testimony  and  made  credibility  determinations  of \nmultiple  decisionmakers  central  to  the  design  of  the \nchallenged districts. See Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1478 (“A \nchoice to believe ‘one of two or more witnesses, each of \nwhom has told a coherent and facially plausible story \nthat  is  not  contradicted  by  extrinsic  evidence,’  can \n‘virtually  never  be  clear  error.’”)  (quoting  Anderson, \n470 U.S. at 575).  \n\nUltimately,  the  mapdrawers  themselves  acknowl-\nedged that creating a separate Cameron County-based \ndistrict,  protecting  Representative  Farenthold,  and \nrespecting  the  §2  voting  rights  of  Nueces  County \nLatinos  was  not  a  zero  sum  game.  See  Supp.  App. \n297a. Despite the multitude of options, and consistent \nwith their statewide approach of using race to achieve \nmaximum political gain for Anglo Republicans, map-\ndrawers chose the one configuration that unnecessarily \nisolates  Nueces  County  Latinos  from  an  opportunity \ndistrict and drowns out their electoral power in Anglo-\ndominated CD27. \n\nB.  CD27 Violates § 2’s Effects Test \n\nRegardless  of  the  motivation  behind  CD27,  the \ndiscriminatory  impact  on  Latino  voters  in  Nueces",
        "50 \n\nCounty  who  have  been  unlawfully  deprived  of  the \nequal  opportunity  to  elect  their  candidates  of  choice \nin  CD27.  The  “approximately  200,000 \npersists \nHispanic voters in Nueces County (a majority-HCVAP \ncounty)  [who]  had  a  §2  right  that  could  be  remedied \nbut was not” have suffered from the practical effects of \nvote dilution in every election held this decade. C.J.S. \nApp. 181a. \n\nAfter examining each of the necessary elements for \na §2 violation, the district court found that CD27 “has \nthe effect of diluting Nueces County Hispanic voters’ \nelectoral  opportunity,”  C.J.S.  App.  190a-91a.  Specifi-\ncally,  it  found  that  (1)  “a  district  could  be  drawn  in \nwhich Hispanics, including Nueces County Hispanics, \nare sufficiently numerous and geographically compact \nto  constitute  a  majority  HCVAP”;  (2)  “racially  polar-\nized voting exists such that an Anglo-majority would \nusually  defeat”  the  Latino-preferred  candidate;  and  \n(3)  “[a]  searching  practical  evaluation  of  ‘past  and \npresent reality’ and a functional view of the political \nprocesses indicates that the political processes are not \nequally open to Hispanics.” Id. 190a. \n\nThe State does not dispute that the discriminatory \neffects  of  CD27  “may  be  carried  over  .  .  .  from  one \nversion of a law to another.” Br. 31-32. It argues only \nthat Plan C235’s incorporation of seven Latino oppor-\ntunity districts in south/west Texas satisfies the first \nprong  of  the  Gingles  test  and  therefore  forecloses  a  \n§2 claim. Br. 49-50. To be sure, Appellants, Appellees, \nand the district court all agree that §2 requires seven \nLatino  opportunity  districts  in  the  area.  See  C.J.S. \nApp.  112a.  But  that  conclusion  is  the  beginning,  not \nthe end, of the §2 inquiry. \n\nThe  State’s  argument  falters  because  it  fails  to \naccount  for  the  invalid  racial  gerrymander  of  CD35.",
        "51 \n\nThe  State  itself  acknowledges  that  to  establish  the \neffects prong of a vote dilution claim, a plaintiff must \nprove  that  there  is  “‘the  possibility  of  creating  more \nthan  the  existing  number  of  reasonably  compact \ndistricts with a sufficiently large minority population \nto  elect  candidates  of  [the  minority  group’s]  choice.’” \nBr.  49  (quoting  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  at  430) \n(emphasis added). Once the CD35 constitutional viola-\ntion is unraveled, removing the Travis County Latinos \nthat were gerrymandered into the district, the “exist-\ning  number”  of  Latino  opportunity  districts  falls  one \nshort of the undisputed §2 requirement, and a Latino \nopportunity  district  still  must  be  established  some-\nwhere  in  the  South  and  West  Texas  envelope  to \nreplace  it.  This  means  that  Nueces  County  and  its \nlarge Latino population must be pulled back into the \nenvelope in order to satisfy the State’s §2 obligation. \nSee  Supp.  App.  300a  (“Including  the  population  of \nNueces County in the envelope makes it easier to draw \nseven  Latino  opportunity  districts  under  §2  without \nincluding Travis County.”). \n\nThis is the very thing the Legislature chose not to do \nwhen  it  designed  CDs  27  and  35.  It  took  Nueces \nCounty  Latinos  who  had  a  §2  right  and  put  them  in  \nan Anglo-dominated district where their rights could \nnot be exercised. In exchange, mapdrawers carved up \nTravis County racially, placing nearly 150,000 Travis \nCounty  Latinos  in  CD35,  even  though  they  did  not \nhave  a  §2  right.  In  short,  it  engineered  a  trade  that \ntook §2 rights from those who have them to provide a \n§2 remedy to those who do not. LULAC v. Perry holds \nthat such a trade is itself a §2 violation. \n\nThe  Court  has  rejected  the  premise  that  a \nState can always make up for the less-than-\nequal  opportunity  of  some  individuals  by",
        "52 \n\nproviding  greater  opportunity  to  others.  .  .  . \n[T]hese  conflicting  concerns  are  resolved  \nby  allowing  the  State  to  use  one  majority-\nminority  district  to  compensate  for  the \nabsence of another only when the racial group \nin each area had a §2 right and both could not \nbe accommodated. \n\n548 U.S. at 429. “Simply put, the State’s creation of an \nopportunity district for those without a §2 right offers \nno  excuse  for  its  failure  to  provide  an  opportunity \ndistrict  for  those  with  a  §2  right.”  C.J.S.  App.  181a \n(quoting LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. at 430).  \n\nThe  State  offers  little  in  response  to  the  obvious \nparallels  to  LULAC  v.  Perry.  According  to  the  State, \nbecause  the  trade  in  LULAC  v.  Perry  was  deemed \nunlawful for the new district’s failure to comply with \nthe first Gingles prong, it has no bearing here, where \nthe district court found the new district (CD35) failed \nto comply with the third Gingles prong. Br. 50. This is \na distinction without a difference. This Court’s holding \nin LULAC v. Perry rests not on the presence or absence \nof  a  specific  precondition  but  on  the  presence  or \nabsence of “a §2 right.” 548 U.S. at 430; see also Shaw \nII, 517 U.S. at 917 (“The vote-dilution injuries suffered \nby  [individuals  with  a  §2  right]  are  not  remedied  by \ncreating a safe majority-[minority] district somewhere \nelse in the State.”). Texas’s failure to grapple with the \nbasis for the district court’s §2 effects ruling is fatal to \nits appeal of the §2 invalidation of CD27. “Under § 2, \nthe State must be held accountable for the effect of [its] \nchoices in denying equal opportunity to Latino voters.” \nLULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. at 441-42 (emphasis added).",

Does the Court have jurisdiction under 28 U.S.C. \n§  1253  to  hear  the  State’s  appeal  prior  to  entry  of \ninjunctive relief? \n\n2.  Did  the  district  court  commit  clear  error  in \ncarefully considering the substantial factual record of \nracial predominance in the drawing of CD35, or in con-\ncluding  no  narrowly  tailored  or  compelling  justifica-\ntion supported such racial predominance? \n\n3.  Did  the  district  court  properly  find  that  CD27 \nviolates  the  Fourteenth  Amendment  and  §2  of  the \nVoting Rights Act by diluting Latino voting rights? \n\n(i) \n\n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n\fii \n\nRULE 29.6 STATEMENT \n\nThe  Mexican  American  Legislative  Caucus,  Texas \nHouse of Representatives (“MALC”) is an official caucus \nof the Texas House of Representatives.

Shambie Singer, \nStatutes and Statutory Construction (7th \ned. 2009) ............................................... 29-30, 31 \n\n\fINTRODUCTION \n\nThis appeal is not about a statewide congressional \nmap called Plan C235. Nor is it about a “court-drawn” \nredistricting plan at all. Rather, this appeal is about \ntwo  specific  congressional  districts,  both  drawn  line-\nby-line and block-by-block by the Texas Legislature in \n2011 in the exact configuration they maintain to this \nday.  Whether  the  plan-wide  label  slapped  onto  the \ncongressional map is C185 or C235, these two districts \nare  the  same,  occupying  the  same  territory  and  con-\ntaining  the  same  voters  that  the  2011  Legislature \ncorralled into them. \n\nIn  the  State’s  telling,  there  was  a  brief,  shining \nmoment in 2013 when Texas history reversed course \nand the Texas Legislature fell all over itself to conform \nstate conduct to a federal court’s provisional observa-\ntions. The district court rightly saw through the 2013 \nmasquerade.  \n\nBy and large, the days are long past when racially \ninvidious policies are openly declared. Instead they are \ncouched  in  pretext,  and  the  only  way  to  unmask \npretext is to pull back the curtain and see what facts \nlie  behind  it.  This  task—distinguishing  appearance \nfrom  reality—is  assigned  to  district  courts,  charged \nwith sorting through the purported facts and witness \ntestimony to ferret out unlawful racial classifications \nand racial discrimination. \n\nThe  State  and  its  new  United  States  ally  are \nopportunistically  inconsistent  in  their  treatment  of \nappearance  versus  reality.  In  asking  this  Court  to \nreview this premature appeal, they argue that regard-\nless  of  the  outward  appearance  of  the  lower  court’s  \n\n \n \n \n \n\f2 \n\nruling,  this  Court  should  look  beyond  the  words  and \ngive it a “practical” reading to find it has jurisdiction. \nTheir emphasis on the practical effects of government \naction, however, falls away in their substantive argu-\nment. There they argue that the Court must proceed \nformalistically  and  take  at  face  value  whatever  the \nState  purveys  as  justification  for  its  redistricting \nactions.  This  Court,  they  contend,  must  accept  the \nLegislature’s ritualistic 2013 ratification of the district \ncourt’s  plainly  provisional  interim  map  order  as  a \nslate-wiping exercise and not as what the district court \nsaw  it  to  be:  an  effort  to  throw  up  a  smokescreen  to \nobscure  the  motives  underlying  the  2011  legislative \nredistricting plan as to two congressional districts left \nentirely unaltered by the 2013 bill. \n\nThe State further insists that this Court accept its \nformalistic  accounting  method  for  creating  minority \nopportunity  districts,  that,  if  accepted  at  face  value, \ngives the technical appearance of compliance with the \nVoting  Rights  Act  and  masks  the  practical  reality—\nand practical effect—of a legislative attempt to under-\nmine the Act. Much as the Legislature used a demo-\ngraphic  “nudge  factor”  to  paint  a  false  picture  of  \nthe  2011  version  of  CD23  as  a  minority  opportunity \ndistrict  when  it  was  specifically  micro-designed  to \nachieve the opposite result, the State argues that its \ndrawing  of  CD35  was  tailored  to  comply  with  its \nobligations under §2, when the reality, unearthed by \nthe  district  court,  was  that  CD35  was  designed  to \nachieve  a  double-whammy:  eliminate  a  preexisting \ncrossover  district  where  minority  voters’  rights  were \nalready protected and trade away the voting rights of \nnearly a quarter million Latinos in Nueces County two \nhundred  miles  away  by  stranding  them  in  a  new \ndistrict  where  they  are  submerged  in  a  sea  of  Anglo \nbloc voting. \n\n \n\f3 \n\nAppellees lay out the facts below in significant detail \nbecause, in a case like this where appearance is pitted \nagainst reality, the facts are all the more important. \n\nSTATEMENT \n\nAt the center of this appeal are two Texas congres-\nsional  districts  in  the  statewide  map  labeled  Plan \nC235: CDs 27 and 35. The district court found consti-\ntutional  and  statutory  violations  in  the  two  districts \nbut  has  not  yet  determined  an  appropriate  remedy. \nThe State, now joined by the United States, seeks pre-\nremedy reinstatement of the districts. \n\nCDs 27 and 35 are creatures of the 2011 Legislature. \nSections  27  and  35  of  Article  II  of  the  2011  congres-\nsional redistricting bill establish the two districts and \nspecify their census geography. Act of June 20, 2011, \n82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 1, 2011 Tex. Gen. Laws 5091-\n5180. When the Legislature amended the bill in 2013, \nit bypassed these two sections altogether, leaving CDs \n27 and 35 in the “exact same configuration” since 2011. \nC.J.S. App. 113a.1 \n\nA.  In League of United Latin American Citizens v. \nPerry,  548  U.S.  399  (2006)  (“LULAC  v.  Perry”),  the \nCourt  invalidated  Texas  Congressional  District  23  \nas a violation of §2 of the Voting Rights Act, 52 U.S.C. \n§  10301.  On  remand,  the  district  court  remedied  the \nviolation, adjusting the boundaries of five Texas con-\ngressional  districts.  457  F.  Supp.  2d  716  (E.D.  Tex. \n2006).  The  court’s  changes  were  incorporated  into  a  \n\n1  “C.J.S.  App.”  refers  to  the  appendix  to  the  Jurisdictional \nStatement in Case No. 17-586. “Supp. App.” refers to the supple-\nmental appendix (containing the findings of fact) to the Motion to \nDismiss or Affirm in Case No. 17-586. “J.A.” refers to the Joint \nAppendix. \n\n \n \n                                                            \n\f4 \n\nstatewide  map  called  Plan  C100  (the  “benchmark” \nplan). It contained six Latino opportunity districts in \nthe region of the state with the heaviest concentration \nof Latino voters.2 This is the large swath of South and \nWest Texas radiating in a fan south- and southwest-\nward from Travis County—but not including it—that \nis referred to in this litigation as the South and West \nTexas “envelope.” 457 F. Supp. 2d at 720; Supp. App. \n428a.3 The benchmark plan remained in effect through \n2010.  \n\nBenchmark  CD27  ran  south  along  the  Texas  Gulf \nCoast,  from  Nueces  County  in  the  north  to  Cameron \nCounty  on  the  Mexican  border.  It  had  been  in  this \nsouthern  orientation—and  had  been  a  Latino  oppor-\ntunity district under §2—since 1982. Supp. App. 287a-\n88a,  299a.  Until  2010,  Nueces  County  Latinos  had \nbeen electing their congressional candidates of choice \nfor more than a quarter century. Id. 294a. \n\n2  A  minority  opportunity  district  under  §2  is  one  in  which \nminority voters comprise a majority of eligible voters and have a \nreasonable  opportunity  to  elect  candidates  of  their  choice.  See, \ne.g., Johnson v. De Grandy, 512 U.S. 997, 1014 n.11 (1994). As to \nterminology, this brief uses the term “Latino” instead of the term \n“Hispanic” often used in the proceedings below, but quotes and \nshorthand references, such as “HCVAP,” derived from “Hispanic” \nare left in the form used below. \n\n3  The  district  court  described  the  South  and  West  Texas \nenvelope as the “large triangular area contained by a line starting \nin Nueces County, running south to Cameron County, then along \nthe  Rio  Grande  River  to  El  Paso  County,  then  from  El  Paso \nCounty  to  Bexar  County,  then  northeast  to  the  Hays/Travis \nCounty  line,  and  back  to  Nueces  County.”  Supp.  App.  298a. \nTravis County lies north of the envelope in Central Texas. There \nis  a  seventh  Latino  opportunity  district  in  another  part  of  the \nstate—CD29  in  Harris  County—that  is  not  at  issue  in  this \nappeal. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f5 \n\nBenchmark  CD25  was  anchored  in  Travis  County \n(home to Austin) in Central Texas and ran southeast \nfrom  there  through  less  populated  counties.  Most  of  \nits population was in Travis County. Supp. App. 301a. \nIt functioned as a “crossover district.” Id. 340a, 428a; \nC.J.S. App. 175a-76a; Br. for State Appellants (“Br.”) \n47 n.12. \n\nThe last round of congressional elections conducted \nunder  Plan  C100  in  2010  was  a  wave  election  for \nRepublicans.  Supp.  App.  25a.  One  exception  was  in \nbenchmark CD25, where the Anglo Democratic incum-\nbent  was  reelected  with  the  support  of  Latino  and \nAfrican-American  voters.  Id.  301a,  428a.  But  else-\nwhere, Democratic incumbents fared poorly, including \nin  districts  in  South  and  West  Texas  where  Latino \nvoters who had an opportunity to elect candidates of \ntheir  choice  failed  to  do  so  in  2010.  In  benchmark \nCD27,  an  Anglo  Republican,  Blake  Farenthold,  won \nagainst  the  Latino  candidate  of  choice,  Democratic \nincumbent  Solomon  Ortiz,  by  a  less  than  1  percent \nmargin.  Id.  26a,  291a-92a.  In  benchmark  CD23,  a \nLatino opportunity district spread across West Texas \nfrom  San  Antonio  to  El  Paso,  the  Latino-preferred \nDemocratic incumbent also lost to a Republican chal-\nlenger. Id. 25a. \n\nB.  Release  of  the  2010  decennial  census  showed \nthat  the  state’s  population  had  increased  by  4.2 \nmillion  over  the  previous  decade.  Supp.  App.  457a.  \nIts population contained no racial or ethnic majority. \nDkt. No. 277 at 22 (Stip. 76). The surge in population \nyielded  Texas  four  new  congressional  seats.  Perry  v. \nPerez, 565 U.S. 388, 390 (2012). \n\nThis  massive  growth  in  population  was  dispro-\nportionately  African-American,  Latino,  and  Asian-\nAmerican. Ninety percent of the statewide population \n\n \n\f6 \n\ngrowth  was  attributable  to  minorities,  with  Latinos \nalone  accounting  for  65  percent  of  the  growth.  Supp. \nApp.  16a,  457a.  Minorities  further  accounted  for  70 \npercent of the growth in citizen voting age population \n(“CVAP”). Id. 459a. The Anglo share of CVAP, mean-\nwhile, declined in every benchmark district. Id. 460a. \n\nIn  the  South  and  West  Texas  envelope,  Latinos \naccounted  for  almost  all  of  the  CVAP  growth.  Supp. \nApp.  461a.  All  six  of  the  benchmark  plan’s  Latino \nopportunity  districts  in  the  envelope  were  overpop-\nulated. Id. 430a-31a. Collectively, they were so overpop-\nulated that enough population was left over to compose \nnearly three-quarters of a new ideal-size district. Id. \n\nTravis County also had significant population growth \nbut, in contrast to other major areas of the state, the \npace  of  Anglo  growth  essentially  equaled  the  pace  of \nLatino growth.  Supp. App. 460a-61a. \n\nC.  As the 2011 redistricting process began, Republi-\ncans  held  overwhelming  majorities  in  the  Texas \nLegislature  and  were  “hostile  to  the  creation  of  any \nminority  districts.”  Supp.  App.  38a,  476a.  They  and \ntheir  redistricting  leaders—Representative  Solomons \nin  the  House  and  Senator  Seliger  in  the  Senate—\nequated  minority  opportunity  districts  with  Demo-\ncratic districts and therefore opposed creation of any \nnew congressional district that would be dominated by \nvoters  of  color  unless  they  deemed  it  required  by  §2. \nId. 438a, 476a.4  \n\n4 Solomons and Seliger, along with Solomons’ chief mapdrawer \nRyan  Downtown,  were  “the  primary  persons  responsible  for \ndrawing  and  making  decisions  about  the  congressional  map.” \nSupp. App. 431a. \n\n \n \n                                                            \n\f7 \n\nThe  actual  mapdrawing  job  fell  to  the  House \nredistricting  committee,  chaired  by  Representative \nSolomons.  Supp.  App.  152a.  Chairman  Solomons, \nunfamiliar  with  redistricting  law  and  Voting  Rights \nAct  requirements,  appointed  staffer  Ryan  Downton, \nalso  lacking  in  redistricting  experience,  the  primary \nmapdrawer. Id. 44a, 46a, 152a. \n\nFour  foundational  principles  set  the  stage  for  the \ndrawing of the new congressional plan. First, Downton, \nwith Solomons’ and Seliger’s acquiescence, used an auto-\nmatic numerical metric for deciding what constituted \na  minority  opportunity  district  under  §2.  His  “sole \ncriterion” for determining the existence of such a dis-\ntrict was whether its population was majority CVAP \nfor  a  single  minority,  “even  if  it  never  elected  the \nminority’s  candidate  of  choice.”  Supp.  App.  437a. \nThus,  to  classify  a  district  as  a  Latino  opportunity \ndistrict, the Legislature’s chief mapdrawer set a quota \nof 50 percent or more HCVAP, regardless of actual or \nanticipated election outcomes. See, e.g., id. 383a. \n\nSecond,  the  proposal  to  create  a  new  minority \nopportunity district in the Dallas-Fort Worth (“DFW”) \narea,  Supp.  App.  253a,  256a,  was  rejected  as  not \nrequired by §2. Id. 258a-59a, 260a, 286a. \n\nThird, after the decision not to draw a new minority \nopportunity district in the DFW area, Solomons estab-\nlished a “3-1 rule” for the new districts. Regardless of \npopulation  growth,  only  one  of  the  four  new  seats \nwould be a district favoring Democrats and, perforce, \nit would be a minority opportunity district. Supp. App. \n286a, 435a. “Once Solomons was advised that only one \nnew VRA district was required, Solomons would only \nconsider  a  map  that  increased  the  net  number  of \nRepublican districts by three.” Id. 439a; see also C.J.S. \nApp.  172a  (objective  was  to  create  a  3-1  map  that \n\n \n\f8 \n\n“increased  the  number  of  Republican  seats  by  three \nand  Democrat  seats  by  only  one”);  id.  220a  n.73 \n(mapdrawers “adhere[d] to a 3-1 map policy”). \n\nFourth,  there  was  a  political  imperative  to  protect \ntwo Republican incumbents when drawing districts in \nthe  South  and  West  Texas  envelope.  Those  incum-\nbents, Canseco and Farenthold, had won unexpected \nvictories  in  2010  in  Latino  opportunity  districts \n(benchmark CDs 23 and 27, respectively) but neither \nwas the Latino voters’ candidate of choice. Supp. App. \n25a-26a.  The  mapdrawers  knew  that  these  districts \nhad  to  be  reconfigured  to  protect  the  Republican \nincumbents, Supp. App. 151a, 293a, 342a; C.J.S. App. \n143a, 191a-92a, 393a, and that the key to this was to \ndraw in Anglo voters—and draw out Latino voters—in \nand near the envelope.5  \n\nD.  Downton, the mapdrawer, was assigned the task \nof  incorporating  these  four  basic  instructions  into  a \nstatewide map. Specifically, he was to eschew any new \ndistrict for minorities in the DFW area, use the bright-\nline 50 percent metric to measure what constitutes a \nminority opportunity district, allow a net gain of only \n\n5 These problems were highlighted as redistricting strategizing  \ngot  underway  in  late  2010  in  two  memos  by  Eric  Opiela,  the \nRepublican  congressional  delegation’s  redistricting  emissary  to \nthe Legislature and a regular confidante of Downton. Supp. App. \n442a. The first memo, directed primarily at CD23, suggested the \nuse  of  a  “nudge  factor”  to  protect  Canseco  by  “nudging”  high \nturnout  Latino  voters  out  of  the  district  and  swapping  in  low \nturnout Latino voters, increasing the total HCVAP of benchmark \nCD23 but lowering the likelihood the Latino-preferred candidate \nwould win. Id. 27a-28a, 431a-32a. The second memo, issued a few \ndays later, highlighted the “problems inherent in trying to protect \nboth  Farenthold  and  Canseco”  and  identified  the  need  to  find \nmore “Anglo voters”—a term used four times in the short memo—\nsomewhere in or near the envelope. Id. 29a. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f9 \n\none  Democratic  district  (deemed  synonymous  with  a \nminority opportunity district) in or near the South and \nWest  Texas  envelope,  and  protect  both  Canseco  and \nFarenthold’s incumbencies by drawing new districts in \nwhich enough Anglos were added so they would win. \nHis  solution  in  drawing  CDs  27  and  35—adopted  by \nthe 2011 Legislature, signed by the Governor, and left \nuntouched  ever  since—is  the  one  invalidated  by  the \ndistrict court and now before this Court for review. \n\n1.  DFW  Area.  As  set  forth  above,  the  proposal  to \ncreate a minority opportunity district in the DFW area \nhad  been  flatly  rejected.  Implementing  this  instruc-\ntion, however, was no easy feat in light of the massive \nminority  population  growth  in  the  area,  which \naccounted  for  adding  a  new  seat  there,  Supp.  App. \n286a.  Using  racial  data,  the  mapdrawers  sliced  and \ndiced the minority population to “decrease current and \nfuture  minority  voting  strength,”  and  district  lines \n“pulled  strangely-shaped  minority  population  areas \nout  of  certain  districts  in  order  to  submerge  them  \nin  larger  Anglo  populations  and  to  reduce  minority \nvoting strength.” C.J.S. App. 400a; Supp. App. 286a. \n\n2.  CD23.  In  CD23,  two  of  the  basic  instructions \nconverged. Mapdrawers used the bright-line 50 percent \nHCVAP  metric  for  what  would  be  deemed  a  Latino \nopportunity  district  and,  working  within  that  frame-\nwork, assiduously traded precincts in and out to imple-\nment  the  “nudge  factor”  concept  to  protect  Canseco’s \nincumbency.  Working  closely  with  others,  Downton \nput the nudge factor to work, painstakingly identifying \nprecincts  with  high  Latino  presence  and  low  Latino \nturnout, and then artfully manipulating district lines \nto  increase  HCVAP  percentage  while  excluding  high \nturnout Latino precincts from the district. C.J.S. App. \n\n \n\f10 \n106a,  145a;  Supp.  App.  391a.6  The  Legislature  then \nassigned CD23 to the category of “Latino opportunity \ndistrict,”  even  though  it  was  drawn  for  the  specific \npurpose of ensuring that the Latino-preferred candidate \nwould  not  win.  C.J.S.  App.  146a.  In  other  words, \nborrowing  from  the  2003  legislative  playbook,  the \nLegislature reconfigured benchmark CD23 “to protect \na Republican candidate who was not the Latino candi-\ndate of choice from the Latino voting majority in the \ndistrict.” Id. 144a; see also id. 147a-48a (CD23 recon-\nfigured  to  “create  the  facade  of  a  Latino  opportunity \ndistrict”).  The  district  had  been  “nudged”  from  one \nthat performed for Latino voters to one that would not. \n\nEven with the putative Latino opportunity district \nin CD23, the Legislature knew that §2 would require \none more Latino opportunity district in the South and \nWest Texas envelope, for a total of seven. Supp. App. \n435a; C.J.S. App. 176a, 392a.  \n\n3.  CD27 and Nueces County. Nueces County (home \nto Corpus Christi) contains 206,000 Latinos, 133,370 \nof them citizens of voting age, and is overwhelmingly \nLatino in total population. Supp. App. 294a; JX-100.2. \nBenchmark  CD27,  which  housed  the  entirety  of \nNueces County, was a Latino opportunity district that, \nas of 2011, was overpopulated by only 43,500 people. \nSupp.  App.  293a.  Voting  in  Nueces  County  is  highly \npolarized along racial lines. Id. 300a; C.J.S. App. 183a, \n185a.  \n\nThe mapdrawers knew that the obvious solution to \nthe §2 problem the State faced in the South and West \nTexas envelope was to leave Nueces County, or most \nof  it,  in  the  envelope  and  in  its  long-time  southward \n\n6  The  district  court  found  Downton’s  denials  of  the  cohesion \n\nand turnout manipulation “not credible.” C.J.S. App. 146a n.20. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f11 \n\norientation.  Supp.  App.  297a.  As  the  district  court \nexplained: “Including the population of Nueces County \nin the envelope makes it easier to draw seven Latino \nopportunity  districts  under  §2,”  without  extending \nbeyond the envelope into Travis County. Id. 300a.  \n\nInstead, however, Downton removed Nueces County \nentirely from the South and West Texas districts and \ndrew it into a district oriented northward, out of the \nenvelope. Supp. App. 293a, 298a-99a; see J.A. 450a.7  \n\n7  The  geographic  details,  down  to  street  level,  of  individual \ndistricts  in  Plan  C235  are  available  online  at  the  public  Texas \nRedistricting  website  maintained  by  the  Texas  Legislative \nCouncil. See District Viewer interactive map: Plan C235, http:// \nwww.tlc.state.tx.us/redist/districts/congress.html. \n\n \n \n                                                            \n\f12 \n\nWhile  mapdrawers  and  legislators  understood  that \nthey could have protected Farenthold in a northward-\noriented district while at the same time retaining most \nof Nueces County—and nearly all of its Latinos—in an \nopportunity  district  oriented  southward,  Supp.  App. \n297a, they deliberately chose not do so, id. 299a-300a. \n\nThe  “primary  and  dominant  motive”  driving  this \ndecision “was to place the incumbent Farenthold, who \nlived in Nueces County and would likely be ousted by \nthe  existing  Latino  majority,  into  an  Anglo-majority \ndistrict (and thus to take away the opportunity to elect \nthat Nueces County Latinos had enjoyed).” C.J.S. App. \n191a.  The  method  chosen  to  effectuate  this  purpose \nwas  to  strand  all  Nueces  County  Latinos—nearly  a \nquarter of a million of them—in a new majority-Anglo \nCD27  where  they  have  “no  opportunity”  to  elect \ncandidates of their choice. Id. 190a; Supp. App. 294a-\n96a, 433a.  \n\nTo ensure that the purposeful elimination of bench-\nmark  CD27  as  a  Latino  opportunity  district  would  \nnot  result  in  one  less  such  district  in  the  envelope, \nDownton  and  the  Legislature  substituted  a  new \nCD34—a  Latino  opportunity  district—running  north \nalong  the  Gulf  coast  from  Cameron  County  on  the \nMexican  border  south  of  Nueces  County.  Supp.  App. \n299a.  Having  satisfied  their  objective  of  protecting \nFarenthold by drawing Nueces County Latinos out of \nthe  envelope,  the  mapdrawers  set  to  the  task  of \ncreating the §2-mandated seventh Latino opportunity \ndistrict. \n\n4.  CD35,  Benchmark  CD25,  and  Travis  County.  \nFor  their  new  Latino  opportunity  district,  Downton \nand  the  Legislature  looked  to  Travis  County.  To  be \nsure,  the  Legislature  had  “no  reasonable  basis”  for \nconcluding that a §2 Latino opportunity district should \n\n \n\f13 \n\nbe  drawn  in  the  county.  Supp.  App.  340a,  342a.  Nor \nwas it necessary to draw any of Travis County into a \nnew Latino opportunity district in order to reach the \nobjective of adding one in the South and West Texas \nenvelope.  Id.  340a,  440a.8  But  the  Legislature  did  \nit  anyway.  It  used  race  as  a  tool  not  to  comply  with  \n§2,  but  to  obtain  political  advantage  by  creating  the \n“facade of complying with § 2 while actually minimiz-\ning the number of districts in which minorities could \nelect  their  candidates  of  choice  despite  the  massive \nminority  population  growth  that  had  occurred \nthroughout  the  state.”  C.J.S.  App.  178a;  see  also  id. \n110a  (putting  Travis  County  population  into  CD35 \n“use[d] race as a tool for partisan goals”). \n\nUnder the benchmark plan, Travis County already \nanchored  benchmark  CD25,  the  crossover  district \nwhere,  with  Anglo  crossover  support,  Latinos  and \nAfrican  Americans  were  able  to  elect  their  congres-\nsional  candidate  of  choice.  Supp.  App.  306a.  And,  in \nstark contrast to the burgeoning Latino growth in the \nSouth and West Texas envelope, which had the most \nconcentrated HCVAP increase in the State, id. 461a, \nTravis County was not an area where Latino growth \nhugely outpaced other growth. C.J.S. App. 169a.  \n\nEven  more  importantly,  Travis  County  is  the  only \nlocale  in  the  state  with  legally  insignificant  levels  of \nracially polarized voting as a whole. C.J.S. App. 175a. \n“Anglo voters do not show high levels of cohesion and \ndo  not  vote  as  a  bloc  against  the  minority-preferred \ncandidates.” Supp. App. 340a. In short, Travis County \n\n8  Downton  “did  not  think  CD35  was  necessary  for  §  5 \ncompliance, and he was not sure if it was required by § 2.” C.J.S. \nApp. 178a-79a n.45. He did not have “any evidence . . . to support \nthe  inclusion  of  Travis  County  in  the  new  §  2  district  when  he \ndecided to place the district there.” Id. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f14 \n\nis  the  notable  exception  to  the  pattern  of  racially \npolarized voting that pervades Texas. C.J.S. App. 21a. \n\nDespite  these  facts,  the  mapdrawers  deliberately \ndismantled  benchmark  CD25  by  drawing  the  state’s \nonly  new  Latino  opportunity  district,  CD35,  into \nTravis County. C.J.S. App. 110a (CD35 placement was \nto “intentionally destroy” benchmark CD25). The new \nplan  divided  Travis  County,  and  its  more  than  one \nmillion  residents,  into  five  congressional  districts, \nnone anchored in the county. Supp. App. 333a. \n\nThe mechanism used to draw CD35 so as to destroy \nCD25, moreover, was race. Downton testified that he \npurposely selected Anglo Democrats in the county and \nseparated  them  into  different  districts.  Supp.  App. \n318a.  He  turned  on  the  software’s  block-level  racial \nshading function to search out Latinos in Travis County. \nId.  337a-38a.  Using  this  capability,  he  reached  into \nnorth central Austin with a narrow “squiggle” that had \nno other purpose than to grab an area that was 90-100 \n\n \n \n\f15 \n\npercent Latino. Id. 318a; C.J.S. App. 167a. He divided \na  Catholic  university  precinct  to  carve  its  Latino-\ndominated  dorms  into  CD35.  C.J.S.  App.  167a.  He \ndisregarded  state  House  district  lines,  and  carved \nthose areas into several congressional pieces, because \nthe  House  lines  did  not  mesh  with  his  racial  line-\ndrawing  objective.  Supp.  App.  320a.  Analysis  of  the \nTravis County divisions show that race was twice as \nlikely  as  party  vote  to  predict  whether  a  voting \nprecinct  ended  up  in  CD35.  Id.  337a.  “The  higher \npercent  Hispanic  a  VTD,  the  more  likely  it  was \nincluded  in  CD35,  and  the  higher  percent  Anglo  a \nVTD,  the  less  likely  it  was  included  in  CD35.”  Id.9 \nCongressional district lines in the county did not align \n“with any recognizable communities other than race.” \nId. 320a. The net effect of the mapdrawers’ race-based \nconfiguration of CD35 in Travis County was to reduce \nby 63,000 the number of Travis County Latino voters \nwith  the  opportunity  to  elect  their  candidates  of \nchoice. Id. 336a.  \n\nThe  southern  end  of  CD35,  in  south  San  Antonio, \nwas equally race-based in its design. C.J.S. App. 169a. \nThe  district  runs  south  out  of  Travis  County  in  a  3-\nmile wide strip along Interstate 35 for fifty miles, then \nfunnels through a narrow neck in northeastern Bexar \nCounty because the area contains low concentrations \nof Latinos. Id. 414a; Supp. App. 318a. The district then \nwidens to include a large concentration of Latinos on \nthe south side of San Antonio.  \n\nAs the district court concluded, CD35 was also the \nleast  compact  of  all  of  the  districts  drawn  in  2011. \nSupp.  App.  339a.  It  retained  this  distinction  in  Plan \n\n9 The expert analysis by Dr. Ansolabehere in his 2014 report is \n\nthe underpinning for these court findings. See J.A. 494a-97a. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f16 \n\nC235, where it remained exactly as it has been since \ndrawn in 2011. JX-100.10. \n\nIn short, as the district court found, it is “clear” that \nrace predominated in drawing CD35. C.J.S. App. 170a; \nsee also id. 166a. This finding “applies to the district \nas a whole.” Id. 170a n.36.  \n\nE.  The 2011 regular legislative session ended with-\nout  enactment  of  a  congressional  plan,  but  on  that \nsame  day  the  Governor  called  a  special  session  to \nbegin immediately. Supp. App. 154a. The Legislature \npassed its 2011 congressional redistricting bill 24 days \nlater, labeling it Plan C185, and the Governor signed \nit in mid-July. Id. 228a-29a. Because §5 of the Voting \nRights  Act  was  still  operative  at  the  time,  the  State \nfiled suit in federal court in the District of Columbia \nseeking preclearance of its plan. Id. 229a. \n\nLawsuits challenging the enacted congressional and \nstate House plans under §2 and the Equal Protection \nClause  also  were  filed  in  federal  district  courts  in \nTexas. Ultimately, nine separate plaintiff groups were \njoined in one consolidated case before the three-judge \ndistrict court in San Antonio.10  \n\nThe San Antonio court held initial hearings regard-\ning the congressional and House plans in September \n2011. But by late October, the district court in the D.C. \npreclearance lawsuit had not yet ruled, and it became \nincreasingly  clear  that  the  San  Antonio  court  would \nhave to craft interim plans for the upcoming elections. \nThe  court  was  forced  to  modify  parts  of  the  election \n\n10  The  United  States  joined  the  plaintiffs  in  challenging  the \n2011 plan but did not challenge the 2013 plan. One of the United \nStates’ claims was that CD27 constituted intentional vote dilu-\ntion in violation of §2 and the Constitution. U.S. Post-Trial Br., \nDkt.

In  late  November  2011,  it  ordered  an  interim \nplan for congressional elections, Dkt. No. 544, but the \nState  appealed  to  this  Court  and,  two  weeks  later, \nobtained  a  stay  of  the  plan’s  implementation.  Soon \nafter, the district court again adjusted election dead-\nlines  and  moved  the  primary  election  to  early  April. \nDkt. No. 563 at 7. \n\nOn January 20, 2012, in Perry v. Perez, this Court \nvacated  the  district  court’s  interim  plan  order  and \nremanded  the  case  for  the  district  court  to  develop  \nan  interim  plan  under  the  new  standards  it  had \nannounced.  The  district  court  promptly  vacated  its \norder for an early April primary and gave the parties \nonly  fourteen  days  to  submit  “agreed-upon  interim \nmaps.” Dkt. No. 583. \n\nA subset of plaintiffs negotiated a compromise with \nthe  State  on  an  interim  map  and  presented  it  to  the \ncourt.  C.J.S.  App.  6a.11  The  compromise  plan’s  prin-\ncipal  changes  were  centered  on  the  DFW  area  and \nCD23.  It  included  no  changes  whatsoever  to  CDs  27 \nand 35.  \n\nThe  State  admitted  the  compromise  plan  was  “far \nfrom  perfect,”  but  still  supported  it  as  “adequate  \nfor  [its]  intended  purpose,”  which  was  to  allow  the \nalready-delayed 2012 primary elections to finally pro-\nceed.

Id. at \n20.12  \n\nBarely a month after Perry’s remand, in the midst of \nnumerous  election  delays,  and  over  objections  from \nmost plaintiffs, the court “accept[ed] the compromise \nplan.” C.J.S. App. 368a. After modifying it for purely \ntechnical  reasons,  the  court  issued  Plan  C235  as  the \ninterim  plan  for  the  2012  elections.  CDs  27  and  35 \nremained exactly the same as the State drew them in \n2011. Id. 113a.  \n\nThe  court  expressly  warned  the  parties  that  the \n“compromise plan” was by no means a “final ruling on \nthe  merits  of  any  claims,”  and  reflects  only  “prelimi-\nnary  determinations”  that  “may  be  revised  upon  full \nanalysis.” C.J.S. App. 367a-68a. In allowing CD35 to \nremain  unchanged  “at  this  time,”  id.  415a,  the  court \nreiterated  that  whether  it  was  a  racial  gerrymander \nwas a “close call,” id. 409a. The court was equally wary \nof its preliminary ruling on CD27, noting that the §2 \nchallenges were “not without merit” and that its ruling \nallowing CD27’s interim use was only effective “at this \ntime.” Id. 419a. In short, Texas was fully on notice that \nthe  “preliminary”  conclusions  about  Plan  C235  were \nnot the court’s final word on the constitutional and §2 \n\n12  The  State  reiterated  this  view  of  the  interim  plan  to  this \nCourt.  After  one  plaintiff  group  petitioned  for  a  stay  of  the \ninterim plan order, the State successfully opposed the stay pri-\nmarily on the ground of short-term necessity. LULAC v.

According  to  the  State,  “[t]he  whole  point  of  drawing \ninterim maps was to . . . have certainty about the shape of their \ndistricts for the upcoming election process.” Id. at 10. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f19 \n\nclaims,  particularly  with  respect  to  CDs  27  and  35.  \nId. 6a (quoting 2012 interim order). \n\nSeveral months later, in late August 2012, the D.C. \ncourt  denied  preclearance,  unanimously  concluding \nthat Plan C185, including CDs 27 and 35, “was enacted \nwith a discriminatory purpose.” Texas v. United States, \n887  F.  Supp.2d  133,  159  (D.D.C.  2012),  vacated  on \nother  grounds,  570  U.S.  928  (2013).  Pointedly,  the \ncourt explained that “[t]he parties have provided more \nevidence of discriminatory intent than we have space, \nor need, to address here,” id. at 161 n.32, and that it \nwas “persuaded by the totality of the evidence that the \nplan  was  enacted  with  discriminatory  intent,”  id.  at \n161. The court further determined that Texas had vio-\nlated  §5  by  dismantling  the  Travis  County-anchored \nbenchmark  CD25,  which  was  home  to  a  “tri-ethnic \ncrossover coalition” where minority voters had had an \nopportunity  to  elect  their  congressional  candidate  of \nchoice. Id. at 184, 190. Texas appealed. \n\nF.  In  2013,  while  the  preclearance  appeal  was \npending with this Court, the Governor called a special \nlegislative  session—on  one  day’s  notice—for  the \nexpress purpose of repealing Plan C185 and adopting \nPlan C235. Supp. App. 231a; C.J.S. App. 40a. This was \nonly  two  years  after  Plan  C185’s  enactment;  legisla-\ntive leadership was the same and so were 75 percent \nof the legislators. C.J.S. App. 38a n.37; Dkt. No. 1442, \nStips. 1-4 (June 28, 2017). The Legislature effectively \namended Plan C185 by adopting the changes made in \nPlan  C235.  Half  of  Plan  C185’s  districts,  including \nCDs 27 and 35, were left in place.13 \n\n13  The  census  block  assignments  in  ten  districts,  including \nCD35,  are  the  same  in  Plans  C185  and  C235.  Another  eight \n\n \n                                                            \n\f20 \n\nThe district court found that “[t]he Legislature did \nnot  adopt  the  Court’s  plans  with  the  intent  to  adopt \nlegally compliant plans free from discriminatory taint, \nbut as part of a litigation strategy.” C.J.S. App. 40a.14 \nThat  litigation  strategy  was  to  evade  the  same  find-\nings of discriminatory intent in the San Antonio court \nthat had already been made by the D.C. court, and to \nclaim protection from the district court’s preliminary \napproval of the interim plan to insulate the State from \nfurther liability. By adopting the interim plan, “how-\never  flawed,”  the  State  sought  to  “prevent  Plaintiffs \nfrom obtaining relief for purposeful racial discrimina-\ntion.” Id. 44a. \n\nThe district court’s express warnings about the limi-\ntations of its 2012 interim plan did not go unnoticed \nby the Legislature’s own attorney. See J.A. 437a-48a. \nIn public testimony, he meticulously walked the legis-\nlators  through  the  court’s  caveats  and  their  implica-\ntions  for  the  legislative  action  under  consideration. \nThe  Legislature,  he  explained,  could  not  rely  on  \nthe  district  court’s  2012  interim  plan  order  as  proof  \nthe  plan  complied  with  the  Voting  Rights  Act  or \nConstitution. The district court, he said, had been “in \na little bit [of a] tricky [position] because [it] had not \nmade  full  determinations,  .  .  .  had  not  made  fact \nfindings on every issue, had not thoroughly analyzed \nall the evidence but they had to make some best-case \nguesses.” C.J.S. App. 43a (citation omitted). \n\ndistricts,  including  CD27,  are  assigned  the  same  populated \ncensus blocks in both plans. Dkt. No. 1442, Stips. 7-8. \n\n14 This unanimous finding was based in part upon documents \npreviously  withheld  by  the  State  but  ordered  released  in  the \nmiddle  of  trial,  and  upon  the  district  court’s  assessment  of  the \ntrial  testimony  of  Rep.  Drew  Darby—a  redistricting  committee \nchairman for the 2013 special session.  C.J.S. App. 44a-45a n.45. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f21 \n\n“[W]illfully ignor[ing] those who pointed out deficien-\ncies,” C.J.S. App. 45a n.45, including its own attorney, \non June 24, 2013, the Legislature ratified Plan C235, \nincluding the 2011 versions of CDs 27 and 35.  \n\nG.  The  district  court  subsequently  conducted  two \nweek-long  trials,  first  on  Plan  C185  in  2014,  then  \non  Plan  C235  in  2017.  In  both,  the  issues  as  to  CDs  \n27 and 35 remained the same, because the “exact same \nconfiguration  of  CD35  and  CD27  remains  in  Plan \nC235” as in Plan C185. C.J.S. App. 113a. The district \ncourt’s  March  2017  ruling  on  Plan  C185  established \nthat  intentional  discrimination  infected  the  2011 \nredistricting  plan,  describing  the  intentional  frac-\nturing  of  communities  of  color  and  race-based  line \ndrawing  across  the  state.  See,  e.g.,  id.  289a  (in  the \nDFW  area  “race  was  used  as  a  proxy  for  political \naffiliation  .  .  .  intentionally  to  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength”);  id.  148a-49a  (mapdrawers’  “intentional[] \ntargeting [of] Hispanic voter turnout and cohesion” in \nCD23 “bears the mark of intentional discrimination”).  \n\nThe court’s August 2017 ruling on Plan C235 effec-\ntively upheld the interim map’s compromise changes \nto  CD23  and  the  DFW-area  districts.  But  the  court \nfound differently for CDs 27 and 35. It sustained the \nchallenges  leveled  against  these  districts  since  the \ncase’s beginning in 2011. It explained that the Legisla-\nture could have complied with its §2 obligation to draw \nseven  Latino  opportunity  districts  in  the  South  and \nWest  Texas  envelope  without  extending  into  Travis \nCounty  by  retaining  Nueces  County  in  the  envelope \ndistricts.  Supp.  App.  300a.  In  finding  that  the  legis-\nlature’s  “offset”  Latino  opportunity  district,  CD35,  \nwas an unconstitutional racial gerrymander, the court \nfound  that  CD35’s  location  “was  not  to  address  §  2 \nconcerns,  but  to  intentionally  destroy  an  existing \n\n \n\f22 \n\ndistrict  [benchmark  CD25]  with  significant  minority \npopulation.” C.J.S. App. 110a.15 \n\nThe court struck down CD35 as a racial gerryman-\nder  in  both  plans.  See  C.J.S.  App.  115a  (“Although \nPlan  C235  was  enacted  in  2013,  the  decision  as  to \nwhich  voters  to  include  within  CD35  was  made  in \n2011, and that remains the proper time for evaluating \nthe district[.]”). The court found that the core African-\nAmerican  community  in  Austin  was  divided  from \nhistorical  communities  of  interest  and  “effectively \nneutered” by grouping it with a distant metropolitan \narea with which it did not share interests. Supp. App. \n335a.  It  concluded  that  “race  subordinated  other \nredistricting  principles”  in  Travis  County,  id.  339a, \n342a, where minority populations were “fractured” and \nLatino  voters  carved  out  for  inclusion  in  a  new \nmajority-minority  district  without  any  Voting  Rights \nAct \nin \njustification  because  Anglo  bloc  voting \nopposition to minority voter preferences is absent, id. \n334a, 340a. \n\nAs  to  CD27,  the  court  found  that  it  had  been \nconverted from a Latino opportunity district into one \nwhere “Latino voters have no opportunity to elect their \npreferred candidates.” C.J.S. App. 190a. The effect was \nto dilute the voting strength of the more than 200,000 \nNueces  County  Latinos  stranded  in  the  district.  Id. \n191a. And the choice was purposeful, made “to protect \nan incumbent who was not the candidate of choice of \n\n15 The court incorporated the findings of fact and opinion that \nissued  with  its  Plan  C185  ruling  a  few  months  earlier  into  the \nPlan  C235  ruling,  and  the  original  dissenting  panel  member \nagreed that the opinion and those findings constitute the law of \nthe case. C.J.S. App. 14a n.13.  The district court was unanimous \nin  its  new  factual  findings  regarding  the  purpose  of  the  2013 \nLegislature’s litigation strategy. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f23 \n\nthose  Latino  voters.”  Id.  190a.  After  the  Plan  C235 \ntrial,  the  court  found  that  this  discriminatory  intent \n“carr[ied]  over”  to  the  2013  adoption  of  identical  dis-\ntrict  lines,  “purposefully  .  .  .  depriv[ing]  plaintiffs  of \nany remedy.” Id. 46a, 116a. \n\nH.  The district court explained at the end of its Plan \nC235  ruling  that  its  previous  bifurcation  of  the  case \ninto separate liability and remedial phases meant that \nits ruling was only addressing the legal violations in \nC235.  C.J.S.  App.  119a.  It  gave  the  Legislature  an \nopportunity  to  remedy  those  violations  found  in  the \nruling.  This  was  hardly  the  first  time  it  had  issued \nsuch  an  invitation.  Four  months  earlier,  after  it  had \nissued  its  Plan  C185  ruling,  the  court  indicated  that \nthe  State  should  be  prepared  to  discuss  whether  the \nLegislature—then sitting in regular session—“intends \nto  take  up  redistricting  .  .  .  to  remedy  any  [C185 \nviolations]  that  persist  in  the  2013  plans”  at  an \nupcoming  hearing.  Dkt.  No.  1352.  This  request  was \nmet  with  legislative  silence.  The  court  again  invited \nthe Legislature to act following this Court’s decision in \nCooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct. 1455 (2017), see Dkt. No. \n1395, but the Legislature again declined.  \n\nAt  a  scheduling  hearing  for  the  C235  trial,  the \nState’s  attorney  told  the  court  that  October  1,  2017, \nwas a fixed date for any remedial plan to be in place. \nHr’g  Tr.  66  (Apr.  2,  2017).  Thus,  when  it  issued  the \nC235  ruling,  the  court  knew  that  the  state-declared \ndeadline  was  only  a  month  and  a  half  away.  Even \nthough the State had turned a deaf ear to its earlier \ninquiries  about  a  legislative  remedy,  the  court  once \nagain invited a legislative solution, asking the State to \nadvise  within  three  business  days—by  August  18—\nwhether a special session would be called to consider \nremedying  the  violations.  C.J.S.  App.  118a.  Absent \n\n \n\f24 \n\nsuch notification, the court indicated that it intended \nto hold a remedy hearing on September 5. Id.  \n\nUpon the State’s petition, this Court stayed further \n\nproceedings. \n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT \n\nTexas  appeals  from  an  order  that  found  two  legal \nviolations  in  a  redistricting  map.  The  order  enjoined \nnothing. Nor did it provide a remedy for the violations \nit found. Whether and when to issue an injunction and \nwhat remedy was needed for the two legal violations \nwere deferred so the court could hold hearings where \nthose  matters  could  be  addressed.  This  Court  lacks \njurisdiction over an appeal of this sort. \n\nIf  the  Court  decides  that  it  has  jurisdiction,  then  \nit  will  be  reviewing  the  constitutional  and  statutory \nvalidity of two specific districts, CDs 27 and 35, in a \nstatewide congressional map labeled Plan C235. Both \ndistricts were in the same place with the same people \nin the earlier statewide map labeled Plan C185. \n\nThe  Court’s  review  of  the  two  districts’  validity  \nis  under  the  clearly  erroneous  standard  set  out  in  \nRule  52(a)  of  the  Federal  Rules  of  Civil  Procedure.  \nThe State cannot escape review under that standard \nby  the  ploy  of  using  a  perfunctory  2013  legislative \n“ratification” of an interim court map that did not even \ntouch the two districts at issue on appeal. The State \nand the United States try to change the Court’s focus \nby claiming that the plan is “court-drawn” and, hence, \nthe State is owed judicial deference in having adopted \nit. But only half of the districts in the court’s one-time-\nonly plan were “court-drawn.” The other half, includ-\ning the two districts at issue here, were “legislatively-\ndrawn”  by  the  2011  Texas  Legislature.  The  2013 \ngambit is nothing but a ruse. \n\n \n\f25 \n\nThe district court painstakingly reviewed the facts \nabout  the  Legislature’s  formation  of  these  districts, \nthe  reasons  for  their  configuration,  and  the  effects  \nof  their  creation  on  minority  voters.  And  what  its \nexhaustive  review  of  the  evidence  showed  is  that \nTexas’s  motivation  for  its  design  of  CD35,  and  its \nchoice of who was in and who was out of it, was over-\nwhelmingly racial. Further, the State had no cogniz-\nable  compelling  interest  in  creating  CD35.  Travis \nCounty,  the  locus  of  the  State’s principal fine-tuning \nof the district, is the one major area of the State where \nracially polarized voting is legally insignificant. While \nthe requirements of §2 of the Voting Rights Act may \nbe  the  raison  d’etre  for  a  race-based  district,  those \nrequirements are simply absent here. Indeed, far from \nhaving “good reasons” to believe that §2 compelled the \nrace-based configuration of CD35 into Travis County, \nAla. Leg. Black Caucus v. Alabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, \n1274  (2015),  the  Legislature  was  motivated  by  the \nundisputedly  bad  reason  of  “destroy[ing]  [an]  other-\nwise  effective  crossover  district[]”  where  minorities \nalready  were  electing  their  candidates  of  choice  \nwith  the  help  of  crossover  Anglo  voters,  Bartlett  v. \nStrickland, 556 U.S. 1, 24 (2009).  \n\nSection 2 further provides no refuge for the config-\nuration  of  CD35  where  the  Legislature  knew  it  had \nreadily at hand an alternative place to draw a Latino \nopportunity district where §2 requirements were easily \nmet.  Unlike \nin  Travis  County,  Nueces  County  \nis  home  to  extensive  racially  polarized  voting,  and  a \nsouthward running Latino opportunity district anchored \nin Nueces County would have satisfied the State’s §2 \nobligation. But the State not only refused to take that \nready route, it affirmatively worked to undo the rights \nof Latinos in that part of the state. And it succeeded in \nits objective. For no reason other than to advance the \n\n \n\f26 \n\nelection  prospects  of  an  Anglo  incumbent,  it  drew  a \nnew district which by its very design would drown out \nthe  votes  of  the  Latino  voters  who  had  §2  rights.  In \nshort,  the  State  cynically  eliminated  the  §2  rights  of \nLatino voters in one part of the State and ostensibly \nassigned those rights to voters in another part of the \nState  where  §2  required  no  remedy.  The  intentional \nvote  dilution  of  Nueces  County  Latinos  in  CD27  had \nits  desired  effect  and  therefore  violates  §2  from  any \nangle. \n\nARGUMENT \n\nI.  THE  COURT  LACKS  JURISDICTION \n\nOVER THIS APPEAL \n\nThis Court has no jurisdiction to entertain Texas’s \npremature  appeal  because  the  district  court  has  not \nordered  injunctive  relief.  Under  28  U.S.C.  § 1253, \nappeals to this Court from three-judge district courts \nmay only occur “from an order granting or denying . . . \nan interlocutory or permanent injunction.” There has \nbeen no such injunction here, as made clear in both the \norder on appeal, see C.J.S. App. 119a, and the court’s \nsubsequent  order  denying  Texas’s  motion  for  stay \npending  appeal,  see  Dkt.  No.  1538  (Aug.  18,  2017) \n(“Although  the  Court  found  violations  in  Plan  C235, \nthe  Court  has  not  enjoined  its  use  for  any  upcoming \nelections.”) (emphasis added). Under the plain text of \n§ 1253, this Court lacks jurisdiction. \n\nThe  “practical  effects”  test  used  in  Carson  v. \nAmerican  Brands,  Inc.,  450  U.S.  79  (1981),  to  deter-\nmine whether there had been the denial of an injunc-\ntion  for  purposes  of  appealability  under  28  U.S.C.  \n§  1292  is  inapposite  here  for  at  least  three  reasons. \nFirst, the State’s argument not only finds no basis in \nthe plain text of § 1253, it directly contradicts the plain \n\n \n\f27 \n\ntext of § 1292, which expressly excludes from its ambit \ninstances  “where  a  direct  review  may  be  had  in  the \nSupreme  Court.”  Second,  grants  of  injunctive  relief \nand denials of injunctive relief are measured by differ-\nent  standards,  the  former  requiring  far  more  detail \nand  precision.  See  Gunn  v.  Univ.  Comm.  to  End  the \nWar in Viet Nam, 399 U.S. 383, 388 (1970) (citing Fed. \nR. Civ. P. 65(d)). Third, even if the two provisions were \nconstrued  the  same  way,  the  liability  ruling  in  the \ncourt  below  did  not  grant  injunctive  relief  in  any \n“practical” sense where the “practical effect” of what a \nremedy would entail, who it would affect, and when it \nwould be implemented remain, to this day, unknown \nand unknowable. \n\nTo avoid repetition, the Appellees on this brief adopt \nby  reference  the  arguments  made  in  opposition  to \njurisdiction  in  Part  I  of  the  Appellees’  brief  on  state \nlegislative districts, Abbott v. Perez, Case No. 17-626. \n\nII.  THE  2013  LEGISLATIVE \n\nINACTION \nWITH RESPECT TO CDS 27 AND 35 DOES \nNOT  SUPPLANT  THE  2011  LEGISLA-\nTIVE  RECORD  FROM  WHICH  THOSE \nDISTRICTS DERIVED \n\nThe State’s central argument is that “any threat of \ninjury  from  the  2011  redistricting  plans  disappeared \nwhen  the  Legislature  repealed  them.”  Br.  44.  With \nrespect to CDs 27 and 35, this is transparently false. \nWhere  these  two  districts  were  first  placed  by  the \nLegislature when it enacted them in 2011, and where \nthey  have  remained  untouched  ever  since,  voters  \nin  those  districts  have  continued  to  suffer  from  the \nunlawful intent that drove their configuration and the \ndiscriminatory  effects  that  have  persisted  in  every \ncongressional election this decade. \n\n \n\f28 \n\nA.  In  2013,  the  Legislature  did  precisely  nothing \nwith respect to CDs 27 and 35. Instead, each and every \ncensus block that was pieced together to form CDs 27 \nand  35  in  2011  was  left  untouched.  Each  and  every \nvoter  who  was  drawn  into  those  districts  in  2011 \nremained  in  those  districts  in  2013.  In  fact,  the  only \nofficial place to find a geographical definition of these \ndistricts  is  in  the  intricacies  of  the  2011  legislation.  \nAct of June 20, 2011, 82nd Leg., 1st C.S., ch. 1, 2011 \nTex.  Gen.  Laws  5091-5180.16  The  2013  redistricting \nbill  does  not  amend  these  districts  in  any  fashion. \nContrary  to  Appellants’  contention,  legislative  inac-\ntion does not magically erase prior legislative intent. \nIf  anything,  a  legislature’s  ratification  of  previous \nactions is nothing more than adoption of them, along \nwith  their  underlying  intentions.  CDs  27  and  35  did \nnot undergo a rebirth in 2013, only a continuation. \n\nAs a practical matter, judicial sanction of the State’s \npurported “make-over” here would invite legislatures \nto  manufacture  new  legislative  records  for  blatantly \ndiscriminatory  laws.  Under  the  State’s  logic,  for \ninstance,  where  a  challenge  to  legislatively  enacted \ndistricts  culminates  in  a  trial  riddled  with  damning \nevidence of discriminatory intent, a legislature could \nsimply  erase  the  record  by  reconvening  before  \na  judicial  ruling  is  entered  and  reenacting  the  same \ndistricts,  this  time  citing  a  purported  effort  to \n“cleanse” the districts of their discriminatory origins, \nor  even  to  “bring  [the]  existing  litigation  to  an  end,” \nBr.  36.  See  C.J.S.  App.  115a  (under  State’s  theory,  \n“a  Legislature  could  always  insulate  itself  from  a \nShaw-type  challenge  simply  by  re-enacting  its  plan \n\n16  As  explained  above,  supra  n.13,  Plan  C235  made  an \ninconsequential change to CD27 by removing a few unpopulated \ncensus blocks. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f29 \n\nand claiming that it made no decisions about who to \ninclude  in  the  district  at  the  time  of  re-enactment”). \nThere can be little doubt that, in such circumstances, \nthe  Legislature  would  and  should  be  unable  to \nsupplant  the  original  legislative  record  with  a  newly \nmanufactured  record  that  results  in  purposeful  rein-\nstatement of the status quo. \n\nAs a legal matter, the fact that Plan C235 nominally \nrepealed  Plan  C185  rather  than  amended  it  does  \nnot  provide  legislative  cover  for  those  districts  that \nremained  the  same.  In  Oneida  County  v.  Oneida \nIndian Nation of New York State, 470 U.S. 226 (1985), \nthis  Court  held  that  a  repeal  in  name  only  has  no \nimpact on the substantive provisions that remain the \nsame.  \n\nAlthough there is a formal repeal of the old by \nthe new statute, still there never has been a \nmoment of time since the passage of the [old] \nact  .  .  .  when  these  similar  provisions  have  \nnot been in force. Notwithstanding, therefore, \nthis formal repeal, it is . . . entirely correct to \nsay that the new act should be construed as a \ncontinuation of the old[.] \n\nId. at 246 n.18 (quoting Bear Lake & River Waterworks \n& Irrigation Co. v. Garland, 164 U.S. 1, 11-12 (1896)); \nsee  also  Posadas  v.  Nat’l  City  Bank  of  N.Y.,  296  \nU.S.  497,  505  (1936).  Technical  canons  of  statutory \nconstruction only reinforce application of this principle \nto the statutory provisions at issue here. “[W]hen an \nexisting  statute  is  reenacted  by  a  later  statute  in \nsubstantially  the  same  terms,  .  .  .  [t]he  unchanged \nprovisions  which  are  repeated  in  the  new  enactment \nare  construed  to  have  been  continuously  in  force.”  \n1A Norman J. Singer & J.D. Shambie Singer, Statutes \nand Statutory Construction (“Sutherland on Statutory \n\n \n\f30 \nConstruction”)  §  23:29  at  542-43  (7th  ed.  2009).  The \nnominal  repeal  of  Plan  C185  in  2013  is  thus  of  no \nmoment  with  respect  to  the  legal  analysis  of  those \ndistricts that have remained in effect since 2011. \n\nIn this situation, the district court properly relied on \nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), to conclude \nthat the portions of the 2011 plan the court found had \nbeen  drawn  with  an  impermissible  motive  “remain \nunlawful”  if  “those  lines  remain  unchanged”  in  Plan \nC235 because the “discrimination continues to have its \nintended effect.” C.J.S. App. 35a. Appellants’ attempt \nto distinguish Hunter, see Br. 32; U.S. Br. 33, rests on \nthe same flawed premise that the Legislature actually \ntook  action  on  CDs  27  and  35  in  2013—which  it  did \nnot.  Hunter  was  unequivocal  on  the  constitutional  \nrule  that  governs  analysis  of  CDs  27  and  35  here:  If \nthe  “original  enactment  was  motivated  by”  invidious \ndiscriminatory  intent  “and  the  section  continues  to \nthis day to have that effect,” it violates equal protec-\ntion  under  the  test  laid  down  in  Village  of  Arlington \nHeights  v.  Metropolitan  Housing  Development  Corp., \n429 U.S. 252 (1977). Hunter, 471 U.S. at 233. \n\nThis  case  is  indistinguishable.  At  the  beginning  of \nthe decade, Texas enacted a redistricting plan riddled \nwith discriminatory intent. While judicial intervention \nmitigated  some  of  the  discriminatory  effect  flowing \nfrom that improper intent, acquiescing to that limited \nand preliminary judicial intervention by enacting Plan \nC235’s  changes  to  the  DFW  districts  and  CD23  does \nnot erase the intent with which CDs 27 and 35 were \nenacted or do anything to ameliorate how that intent \n\n \n\f31 \n\ncontinued to produce the same effect in those districts \nin 2013 and beyond.17 \n\nThe State’s insistence that any analysis of the dis-\ntricts as drawn in 2011 is moot thus strains credulity \nin  light  of  the  fact  that  CDs  27  and  35  have  been \n“continuously  in  force”  since  2011.  Sutherland  on \nStatutory Construction § 23:29 at 542-43. A challenged \nstatute does not become moot just because it is volun-\ntarily repealed (and reenacted, unchanged) in the mid-\ndle of a lawsuit. City of Mesquite v. Aladdin’s Castle, \nInc., 455 U.S. 283, 288-89 n.10 (1982). Here, the Legis-\nlature not only left open the possibility that it might \nreenact  the  2011  redistricting  statute,  it  effectively \ndid reenact—or more precisely, “ratify”—that statute \nwith  respect  to  the  only  districts  at  issue  in  this \nappeal.  See  Ne.  Fla.  Chapter  of  Associated  Gen. \nContractors  of  Am.  v.  City  of  Jacksonville,  508  U.S. \n656,  662  (1993)  (“There  is  no  mere  risk  that \nJacksonville will repeat its allegedly wrongful conduct; \nit has already done so.”); id. at 662 n.3 (controversy is \nnot mooted where a new statute is “sufficiently similar \nto the repealed [statute] that it is permissible to say \nthat the challenged conduct continues”).  \n\n17  Indeed,  the State’s  contention  that  the  reenactment  of the \nidentical  configurations  of  CDs  27  and  35  in  2013  saved  the \ndistricts  from  invalidity  under  the  Constitution  and  Voting \nRights Act is refuted by this Court’s interpretation of the Voting \nRights Act itself. In Reno v. Bossier Parish School Board, 520 U.S. \n471 (1997), this Court was faced with an argument that the 1982 \nrenewal of §5 changed a prior interpretation of the Act’s reach. \nThe  Court  rejected  the  argument  on  the  ground  that  not \namending the statute does not constitute a change in the way the \nstatute should be interpreted. “Quite obviously, reenacting pre-\ncisely  the  same  language  would  be  a  strange  way  to  make  a \nchange.” Id. at 484 (quoting Pierce v. Underwood, 487 U.S. 552, \n567 (1988)). \n\n \n                                                            \n\f32 \n\nB.  Nor  can  the  State  seek  refuge  in  the  district \ncourt’s  purported  “blessing”  of  CDs  27  and  35  in  its \n2012 interim plan order. The State’s defense is unpre-\ncedented,  boiling  down  to  this  putative  rule:  a  legis-\nlature  that  successfully  masks  its  discriminatory \nmotives  during  preliminary  injunction  proceedings \ncan  permanently  erase  a  discriminatory  legislative \nrecord  by  simply  repealing  and  reenacting  its  law—\nshifting  the  responsibility  for  its  creation  from  the \nlegislature to the court.  \n\nAmple authority shows the opposite to be true. The \nCourt  only  recently  explained  the  characteristics  of \npreliminary  rulings  in  terms  contradicting  Texas’s \nargument: \n\nCrafting a preliminary injunction is an exer-\ncise of discretion and judgment, often depend-\nent as much on the equities of a given case as \nthe substance of the legal issues it presents. \nThe  purpose  of  such  interim  equitable  relief \nis  not  to  conclusively  determine  the  rights  of \nthe parties, but to balance the equities as the \nlitigation moves forward. \n\nTrump  v.  Int’l  Refugee  Assistance  Project,  137  S.  Ct. \n2080, 2087 (2017) (emphasis added) (citations omitted). \nThis  echoes  decades  of  precedent  establishing  that  a \npreliminary injunction ruling has limited significance \nfor the ultimate disposition of a claim. \n\nThe  purpose  of  a  preliminary  injunction  is \nmerely  to  preserve  the  relative  positions  of \nthe parties until a trial on the merits can be \nheld.  Given  this  limited  purpose,  and  given \nthe  haste  that  is  often  necessary  if  those \npositions  are  to  be  preserved,  a  preliminary \ninjunction is customarily granted on the basis \n\n \n\f33 \n\nof  procedures  that  are  less  formal  and \nevidence that is less complete than in a trial \non  the  merits.  A  party  thus  is  not  required  \nto  prove  his  case  in  full  at  a  preliminary \ninjunction  hearing,  and  the  findings  of  fact \nand conclusions of law made by a court grant-\ning a preliminary injunction are not binding \nat trial on the merits. \n\nUniv. of Texas v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, 395 (1981) \n(citations  omitted);  see  also  Walters  v.  Nat’l  Ass’n  of \nRadiation  Survivors,  473  U.S.  305,  317  (1985)  (“any \nconclusions  reached  at  the  preliminary  injunction \nstage  are  subject  to  revision”).  The  State’s  gambit  of \nclaiming safe harbor in the district court’s preliminary \nruling “improperly equates ‘likelihood of success’ with \n‘success,’  and  .  .  .  more  important  .  .  .  ignores  the \nsignificant  procedural  differences  between  prelimi-\nnary  and  permanent  injunctions.”  Camenisch,  451 \nU.S. at 394. \n\nThe  State  can  hardly  feign  surprise  that  prelimi-\nnary  court  rulings  cannot  be  used  to  justify  the \nreenactment  of  identical  districts.  Not  only  did  the \nLegislature’s  own  lawyer  caution  against  this  shell-\ngame strategy for hiding the State’s unconstitutional \nconduct in 2013, but also the district court expressly \ntold  Texas  that  its  interim  ruling  was  “not  a  final \nruling  on  the  merits  of  any  claims  asserted  by  the \nPlaintiffs  in  this  case.”  C.J.S.  App.  367a.  The  State  \nhad no basis to believe the §2 and constitutional issues \nhad  been  fully  addressed  or  finally  resolved  where  \nthe district court had cited a variety of “difficult and \nunsettled  legal  issues  as  well  as  numerous  factual \ndisputes”  that  were  made  all  the  more  “difficult  to \ndetermine” in light of the “necessarily expedited and \n\n \n\f34 \ncurtailed”  time  frame  for  analysis.  Id.  367a-368a.18 \nThe  district  court’s  repeated  caveats,  moreover,  that \nthe  interim  plan  was  acceptable  only  to  the  extent  it \nwas  interim  provided  the  Legislature  no  excuse  for \navoiding a considered analysis of its own and cement-\ning CDs 27 and 35 for the remainder of the decade.19 \n\nIn  short,  the  State’s  boast  that  it  simply  “took  the \ncourt at its word,” Br. 2, is an empty one. The district \ncourt’s  “word”  to  Texas  was  that  the  interim  plan \nruling  contained  only  “preliminary  determinations” \nfor  one  election  cycle  that  “may  be  revised  upon  full \nanalysis.”  C.J.S.  App.  367a-68a.  The  State  paid  no \nheed. \n\nThis  Court  should  not  sanction  the  State’s  gaming \nof  the  judicial  process.  The  Legislature’s  inaction  in \n2013 with respect to CDs 27 and 35 left those district \nlines,  and  the  circumstances  of  their  origin,  in  full \nforce  and  effect.  Accordingly,  the  district  court  pro-\nperly grounded its analysis of the districts in the 2011 \nredistricting process.20 \n\n18 Indeed, the only federal court that had carefully considered \nthe  legality  of  the  original  plan  found  rampant  discriminatory \nintent planwide. Texas v. United States, 887 F. Supp. 2d at 159, \n161 & n.32. \n\n19 See, e.g., C.J.S. App. 417a (“For purposes of an interim plan, \nthe Court concludes that C235 adequately addresses the claims \nrelating  to  the  Central  Texas  districts.”)  (emphasis  added);  id. \n423a (deeming Plan C235 “an appropriate interim plan”); id. 368a \n(“accept[ing]  the  compromise  plan”  because  it  “would  signifi-\ncantly  benefit  the  voters,  candidates,  election  administrators, \ncounties, and political parties” for the 2012 elections). \n\n20 Even were the Court to determine that the proper focus of \nthe questions of motive, intent, and purpose is the action of the \n2013  Legislature  instead  of  the  2011  Legislature,  the  district \ncourt unanimously found that the 2013 Legislature displayed the \n\n \n                                                            \n\f35 \n\nIII.  CD35  HAS  BEEN  A  RACIAL  GERRY-\nMANDER EVER SINCE IT WAS DRAWN \nIN 2011 \n\nThe  district  court  struck  down  CD35  as  a  racial \ngerrymander  in  violation  of  the  Equal  Protection \nClause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In accordance \nwith  this  Court’s  precedent,  it  found  that  race  pre-\ndominated  over  traditional  districting  principles  in \n“the drawing of district lines and selection of district \npopulation”  in  CD35,  C.J.S.  App.  166a,  which  main-\ntained  the  “exact  same  configuration”  in  Plans  C185 \nand  C235,  id.  113a.  The  court  further  concluded  \nthat the Legislature’s race-based redistricting of CD35 \nwas  not  tailored  to  a  compelling  state  interest; \nmapdrawers set out “not to substantially address the \n§ 2 requirement, but to use race as a tool for partisan \ngoals.”  Id.  110a.  The  district  court’s  assessment  of \nCD35 in accordance with the “two-step” racial gerry-\nmandering inquiry “warrants significant deference on \nappeal to this Court.” Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464.21  \n\ninvidious  intent  and  dominant  motive  necessary  to  invalidate \nCDs 27 and 35. Its findings are not clearly erroneous and should \nnot be overturned by the Court. The Appellees on this brief adopt \nby reference the arguments made on this point in Part II.B of the \nAppellees’ brief on state legislative districts, Abbott v. Perez, Case \nNo. 17-626. \n\n21  The  district  court’s  racial  gerrymandering  finding  did  not \nhinge  on  the  State’s  discriminatory  intent.  The  district  court \ncorrectly noted that “[d]iscriminatory purpose is not an element \nof a Shaw-type claim.” C.J.S. App. 37a n.36 (referring to Shaw v. \nReno,  509  U.S.  630  (1993));  see  also  id.  164a  n.31  (“The  harm \nflows  from  being  ‘personally  .  .  .  subjected  to  [a]  racial \nclassification,’  not  from  vote  dilution  or  intentional  discrimina-\ntion.”) (quoting Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1265); Covington v. North \nCarolina, 316 F.R.D. 117, 124 n.1 (M.D.N.C. 2016) (“In reaching \nthis  conclusion  [that  race  predominated],  we  make  no  finding \n\n \n                                                            \n\f36 \n\nTexas does not even attempt an argument that race \ndid  not  predominate  in  the  actual  line  drawing  of \nCD35  or  that  the  district  court’s  extensive  factual \nfindings on this score are clear error. For good reason: \nthe evidence of racial predominance in the selection of \npopulation within and without CD35 is overwhelming.  \n\nThe  district  court  found  that  nearly  every  tradi-\ntional districting principle in CD35 was subordinated \nto  race.  In  Travis  County,  the  lines  were  drawn  in \ncomplete  disregard  of  city  boundaries,  state  House \ndistrict  boundaries,  and  “any  other  recognizable \ncommunities of interest other than race.” C.J.S. App. \n168a; Supp. App. 320. Race subordinated party vote—\nby a factor of two—in the shuffling of voting tabulation \ndistricts  in  the  five  new  congressional  districts  tat-\ntooed onto Travis County. Supp. App. 337a. Precincts \nwere split to lasso the heavily-Latino dorms of a local \nCatholic university into CD35, apart from the rest of \nthe school, and to send an “arrowhead” extension into \nnorthern  parts  of  Austin  to  bring  Latino  apartment \nrenters  into  a  district  running  along  the  interstate \nthen looping into the south side of San Antonio eighty \nmiles  away.  C.J.S.  App.  167a;  see  Bush  v.  Vera,  517 \n\nthat  the  General  Assembly  acted  in  bad  faith  or  with  dis-\ncriminatory intent in drawing the challenged districts[.]”), aff’d, \n137 S. Ct. 2211 (2017). That analysis comports with this Court’s \narticulation  of  the  racial  predominance  standard  as  one  which \nexamines  the  use  of  race  in  the  placement  of  voters  in  various \ndistricts.  Alabama,  135  S.  Ct.  at  1271  (“[T]he  ‘predominance’ \nquestion concerns which voters the legislature decides to choose, \nand specifically whether the legislature predominantly uses race \nas opposed to other, ‘traditional’ factors when doing so.”); see also \nMiller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900, 916 (1995). It is the race-based \nplacement of voters without a strong basis in evidence for doing \nso, rather than any intent to discriminate through vote dilution, \nthat defines a Shaw claim. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f37 \n\nU.S.  952,  970-71  (1996)  (“split[]  voter  tabulation \ndistricts”  provide  “objective  evidence”  of  racial  pre-\ndominance since “the districting software used by the \nState  provided  only  racial  data  at  the  block-by-block \nlevel”). \n\nNor were these deviations from traditional district-\ning  criteria  limited  to  the  north  half  of  CD35.  See \nC.J.S.  App.  170a  n.36  (district  court’s  “finding  that \nrace predominated in the drawing of [CD35] applies to \nthe district as a whole”). Race was similarly the basis \nfor  selecting  voters  in  Bexar  County,  where,  after \nsnaking  south  along  the  interstate,  CD35  first \nnarrows  in  low-density  Latino  areas  then  widens  to \nembrace  the  large  Latino  community  in  South  San \nAntonio.  Id.  169a.  Along  the  way,  county  and  small \ncity  boundaries  gave  way  to  race.  Supp.  App.  328a-\n29a;  C.J.S.  App.  170a.  The  end  result  of  this  race-\nbased  carving  of  voters  from  north  central  Austin  to \nthe south side of San Antonio is a district that remains \nthe  least  compact  congressional  district  in  the  state. \nSupp. App. 339a; see also C.J.S. App. 162a-63a.  \n\nWhere,  as  here,  race  predominates,  the  burden \nshifts  to  the  State  to  demonstrate  that  the  district’s \nconfiguration  was  narrowly  tailored  to  a  compelling \ngovernment interest. Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1464. Based \non  all  available  evidence,  the  district  court  rightly \nconcluded  that  Texas  had  not  satisfied  its  strict \nscrutiny  burden  with  respect  to  CD35.  While  Texas \nleaned on §2 of the Voting Rights Act to justify its race-\nbased  redistricting  of  CD35,  the  district  court  found \nnot only that CD35 was not “actually . . . necessary” to \navoid a §2 violation, Alabama, 135 S. Ct. at 1274, but \nalso that the Legislature had “no reasonable basis” for \nbelieving it was, Supp. App. 340a. \n\n \n\f38 \n\nThe  district  court  found—and  Texas  does  not \ndispute—that  “the  third  Gingles  precondition  is  not \npresent in a significant portion of the district,” namely \nTravis  County.  C.J.S.  App.  175a.  See  Thornburg  \nv.  Gingles,  478  U.S.  30,  51  (1986)  (requiring  as  \nprecondition  for  §2  liability  that  “the  white  majority \nvotes sufficiently as a bloc to enable it . . . usually to \ndefeat  the  minority’s  preferred  candidate”).  Unlike \nmost  other  areas  of  Texas,  “Travis  County  does  not \nhave  Anglo  bloc  voting.”  C.J.S.  App.  110a.  Rather, \nTravis  County  Anglos  lack  cohesion  and  split  their \nvote, Supp. App. 308a, and therefore “do not vote as a \nbloc  against  the  minority-preferred  candidates.”  Id. \n340a.  African-American  and  Latino  voters  in  Travis \nCounty “have the ability to elect their preferred candi-\ndates  precisely  because  Anglo  voters  vote  at  suffi-\nciently high rates for minority-preferred candidates.” \nId. Without evidence that racial bloc voting compelled \nthe extension of CD35 into Travis County, Texas’s §2 \njustification falls flat.22 \n\nThe  district  court  further  found  that  “mapdrawers \nknew”  that  the  third  Gingles  precondition  was  not \nsatisfied in Travis County. C.J.S. App. 110a (emphasis \nadded). To be sure, “[t]here is no indication that [the \nmapdrawer]  had  any  evidence,  much  less  a  strong \nbasis  in  evidence,  to  support  the  inclusion  of  Travis \nCounty in the new §2 district when he decided to place \n\n22 While the district court was “inclined to find that CD35 is \nnot compact for §2 purposes,” it deferred the issue since the third \nGingles precondition was found lacking. C.J.S. App. 175a. Indeed, \nthe mapdrawer himself believed that CD35 was “borderline” on \nthe compactness scale and “had his doubts that the district was \nrequired by § 2,” C.J.S. App. 162a, and the State’s own experts \ntestified that CD35 is “definitely not a compact district” and “not \n‘compelling from a Section 2 standpoint,’” id. 162a-63a & n.30. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f39 \n\na  district  there.”  Id.  179a  n.46.  Nor  was  there  any \nevidence “that any member of the Legislature, includ-\ning Chairmen Solomons and Seliger, had any basis in \nevidence for believing that CD35 was required by § 2 \nother than its HCVAP-majority status.” Id.; see also id. \n(mapdrawer “repeatedly testified that his sole criteria \nfor  a  §  2  district  was  whether  it  was  above  50% \nHCVAP”);  id.  178a  (“There  is  no  indication  that \nmapdrawers or the Legislature drew CD35 in Travis \nCounty  because  they  felt  that  Hispanic  voters  there \nhad  a  §  2  right  that  needed  a  remedy.”).  The  State \ncannot now seek refuge in §2 where its configuration \nof CD35 was not even informed by, let alone grounded \nin, an inquiry into §2 requirements. See Shaw v. Hunt \n(“Shaw  II”),  517  U.S.  899,  908  n.4  (1996)  (“To  be  a \ncompelling  interest,  the  State  must  show  that  the \nalleged objective was the legislature’s ‘actual purpose’ \nfor  the  discriminatory  classification,  and  the  legisla-\nture  must  have  had  a  strong  basis  in  evidence  to \nsupport  that  justification  before  it  implements  the \nclassification.”)  (citation  omitted).  The  State’s  willful \nfailure to examine even minimally the critical issue of \nracial bloc voting for purposes of assessing potential §2 \nliability falls far short of its strict scrutiny burden to \nestablish  narrow  tailoring.  See  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at \n1472 (refusing to “approve a racial gerrymander whose \nnecessity is supported by no evidence”). \n\nIn  fact,  the  district  court  found  as  a  fact  that  the \n“actual  purpose”  of  Texas’s  race-based  drawing  of \nCD35 was never based on a legislative belief that §2 \nrequired  its  configuration,  but,  rather,  on  the  race-\nbased  carve-up  of  Travis  County  and  dismantlement \nof the existing crossover district there. \n\n[T]hey  drew  CD35  as  an  HCVAP-majority \ndistrict that extended into Travis County for \n\n \n\f40 \n\nthe  purpose  of  eliminating  the  existing  dis-\ntrict  [CD25]  in  which  minorities  and  Anglos \ntogether elected a Democratic candidate (and \nto  unseat  that  candidate).  In  this  way,  they \nwere  able  to  create  the  facade  of  complying \nwith  §  2  while  actually  minimizing  the \nnumber of districts in which minorities could \nelect  their  candidates  of  choice  despite  the \nmassive minority population growth that had \noccurred throughout the state. \n\nC.J.S. App. 178a; see also id. 110a. This finding is fully \nsupported by the record. See Cooper, 137 S.Ct. at 1465 \n(district court’s findings of fact “are subject to review \nonly for clear error”). The Legislature decided in advance \nthat  any  new  minority  opportunity  district  in  Texas \nhad to yield a net gain of three Republican seats. Supp. \nApp. 439a. “Although [the mapdrawer] could have drawn \na new central Texas Latino opportunity district with-\nout  including  Travis  County  or  disrupting  CD25,  he \nchose this configuration to ensure a 3-1 map.” C.J.S. \nApp. 440a. Thus, the district court concluded, “[a]lthough \na  new  Latino  opportunity  district  was  required  in \nSouth and West Texas, . . . mapdrawers’ placement of \nsignificant population from Travis County into CD35 \nwas not to substantially address the §2 requirement, \nbut to use race as a tool for partisan goals.” Id. 110a.23 \n\n23 To be sure, the State has no compelling interest in achieving \nracially invidious objectives by purposely destroying a crossover \ndistrict. Shortly before this decade’s redistricting cycle, this Court \nadmonished states against such constitutionally suspect conduct. \nSee Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 24 (a showing that a state “intentionally \ndrew  district  lines  in  order  to  destroy  otherwise  effective \ncrossover  districts”  would  “raise  serious  questions”  under  the \nFourteenth Amendment). The district court discussed the consti-\ntutional  problem  with  the  deliberate  destruction  of  the  Travis \nCounty-based crossover district but refrained from directly ruling \n\n \n                                                            \n\f41 \n\nThe State’s principal argument in defense of CD35’s \nrace-based  configuration  is  that  the  district  court’s \ninterim map did not alter it. Br. 45-46. But as set forth \nabove, supra Part II, Texas’s decision to maintain the \nstatus  quo  in  CD35  by  doing  nothing  at  all  in  2013 \ncannot  replace  the  actual  decisions  made  when  the \nactual  lines  were  drawn  by  the  Legislature  in  2011.  \nSee  also  C.J.S.  App.  115a.  The  district  court’s  2012 \npreliminary  inquiry,  moreover,  can  hardly  be  the \njustification for the State’s action where that inquiry \nshifted  the  strict  scrutiny  burden  to  Appellees.  The \ncourt  asked  whether  Appellees  had  “demonstrated  a \nsubstantial  likelihood  that  CD35  would  fail  a  strict \nscrutiny  analysis  if  strict  scrutiny  applies,”  id.  415a, \nnot whether the State would meet its burden to satisfy \nstrict  scrutiny.  Texas’s  glib  contention  that  “[i]f  the \ndistrict court had ‘good reasons’ to believe that CD35 \nneeded to be drawn as a minority-opportunity district \nto  address  potential  VRA  §2  claims,  then  surely  the \nLegislature  did  too,”  Br.  48,  improperly  equates  the \ndistrict  court’s  standard  of  review  under  Perry  with \nthe  State’s  more  exacting  standard  under  strict \nscrutiny.24 \n\non the question because its finding that CD35 is a racial gerry-\nmander would necessitate reconfiguring the area anyway. C.J.S. \nApp. 111a n.83, 172a n.38. Nonetheless, the intentional destruc-\ntion  of  benchmark  CD25  under  the  Bartlett  constitutional  test \noffers  an  alternative  basis  for  invalidating  Plan  C235’s  racial \ncarve-up of Travis County.  \n\n24 Even if the 2013 Legislature’s motivations were relevant, the \ndistrict  court  specifically  warned  the  State  not  to  rely  on  its \n“preliminary  determinations.”  C.J.S.  App.  367a.  The  abundant \ncaveats accompanying the interim plan provided Texas no legal \nor factual basis, let alone a “strong basis in evidence,” Alabama, \n135  S.  Ct.  at  1274,  to  believe  that  §2  required  CD35’s \nconfiguration. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f42 \n\nThe  State’s  only  substantive  argument  on  strict \nscrutiny  is  that  §2  required  the  creation  of  seven \nLatino opportunity districts in south/west Texas. But \nwhile the Legislature “may have had a strong basis in \nevidence for believing” this undisputed fact, it “had no \nbasis  in  evidence  to  believe  that  the  Gingles  precon-\nditions  were  satisfied  in  Travis  County  such  that  \na  race-based  majority-Hispanic  district  should  be  \ndrawn there.” C.J.S. App. 176a. The mere fact that §2 \nrequired  the  creation  of  seven  Latino  opportunity \ndistricts  does  not  give  the  State  license  to  “draw  a \nmajority-minority district anywhere,” even where the \nGingles  preconditions  are  not  present.  Shaw  II,  517 \nU.S. at 916. The inclusion of Travis County “would not \naddress  the  professed  interest  of  relieving  the  vote \ndilution, much less be narrowly tailored to accomplish \nthe goal.” Id. at 917. \n\nAs  detailed  above,  the  mapdrawers  knew  full  well \nthat seven majority-minority districts could be drawn \nin the region—in satisfaction of §2—without the race-\nbased carving of Travis County and the destruction of \nbenchmark  CD25.  C.J.S.  App.  181a  n.47.  Like  the \ndistrict court, this Court should reject Texas’s invita-\ntion to bless its drawing of any old race-based district \nin any old configuration in purported service of §2. The \nquestion before the Court is not whether the State had \ngood reasons to believe that §2 required seven Latino \nopportunity  districts  in  south/west  Texas,  “one  of \nwhich  was  CD35,”  Br.  47,  but  rather  whether  the \nlegislature had good reasons to believe “that the race-\nbased calculus it employed in [CD35] was necessary to \navoid  violating”  §2,  Bethune-Hill  v.  Va.  State  Bd.  of \nElections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 801 (2017); see also Cooper, \n137 S. Ct. at 1469 (“race-based districting is narrowly \ntailored”  to  Voting  Rights  Act  compliance  “if  a  State \n\n \n\f43 \n\nhad ‘good reasons’ for thinking that the Act demanded \nsuch steps”).  \n\nIn its recent strict scrutiny analysis in Cooper, this \nCourt  rejected  the  State’s  proposed  unconstrained \napproach  to  drawing  majority-minority  districts  in \npurported service of §2. There this Court affirmed the \nlower court’s finding that the State of North Carolina \nhad  no  basis  for  revamping  an  existing  crossover \ndistrict in ostensible service to §2 requirements where \nevidence of the third Gingles precondition was lacking. \n137  S.  Ct.  at  1470.  Similarly  here,  the  State  had  no \nreason to think that §2 required it to draw CD35 all \nthe way into Travis County, where the Anglo popula-\ntion  “did  not  ‘vote[]  sufficiently  as  a  bloc’  to  thwart \n[minority]  voters’  preference,”  id.  (quoting  Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 51), and dismantle the existing crossover \ndistrict CD25. In short, “experience gave the State no \nreason  to  think”  that  §2  required  Travis  County \nLatinos to be drawn out of their preexisting crossover \ndistrict and into a new majority-minority district. Id. \n\nIndeed,  just  as  North  Carolina  pursued  a  single-\nminded  focus  on  achieving  50  percent  minority  VAP \nwithout  reference  to  the  third  Gingles  precondition, \nsee id. at 1472, Texas mapdrawers pursued a single-\nminded focus on achieving 50 percent HCVAP in CD35 \nwithout  regard  to  the  presence  of  Anglo  bloc  voting, \nC.J.S.  App.  179a  n.45.  The  incidence  of  racial  bloc \nvoting  in  some  areas  of  south/west  Texas  does  not \nsupport the State’s avowed need to extend CD35 into \nTravis  County  to  avoid  §2  liability.  This  Court  has \nconsistently rejected—and should once again reject—\nthe misguided notion that because there is racial bloc \nvoting  somewhere,  the  State  can  draw  a  §2  remedy \nanywhere. \n\n \n\f44 \n\nTexas cannot take advantage of either its procedural \nmaneuvers or §2 to justify its race-based configuration \nof CD35. The voters of CD35 have cast ballots in this \nunconstitutional district in every election this decade. \nThis Court should affirm the district court’s invalida-\ntion of CD35 as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.  \n\nIV.  CD27 HAS ALWAYS BEEN AND STILL IS \n\nIN VIOLATION OF §2 \n\nThe  district  court  expressly  found  that  “the \nLegislature violated §2 in both result and intent” in its \nconfiguration  of  CD27.  C.J.S.  App.  112a  (emphasis \nadded).  The  State  provides  no  basis  for  overturning \neither finding. While the State points to other possible \nexplanations  for  the  Legislature’s  decision  to  excise \nNueces  County  Latinos  from  the  majority-minority \ndistrict they enjoyed for over 25 years, it cannot escape \nthe  testimony  from  its  own  witnesses  affirming  the \nprimary  intent  to  protect  the  Anglo  incumbent  by \ndrowning out the votes of Nueces County Latinos. The \nState’s myopic focus on its creation of seven majority-\nminority  districts  in  purported  satisfaction  of  §2, \nmoreover, falls away in the face of the unlawful racial \ngerrymander  of  CD35  and  ignores  this  Court’s  well-\nestablished rule that a state cannot skirt the §2 rights \nof minority voters by substituting in a new opportunity \ndistrict where §2 does not require it. \n\nA.  CD27 Intentionally Dilutes the Vote of \n\nNueces County Latinos \n\nThe district court’s findings lifted the veil from the \nState’s  defense  of  what  it  did  to  the  nearly  quarter \nmillion  Latino  voters  in  Nueces  County.  As  detailed \nabove,  while  voting  in  the  county  is  highly  racially \npolarized,  Latinos  there  had  had  the  opportunity  for \n\n \n\f45 \n\nmore  than  a  quarter  century  to  elect  their  congres-\nsional  candidates  of  choice.  But  the  Legislature \ndeliberately and cynically eliminated that ability, and \nintentionally  diluted  the  votes  of  Nueces  Latinos,  by \nstranding  them  in  the  new  Anglo-dominated  district \nwhere  they  lost  their  voting  rights  opportunity.  The \nevidence showed that this was by legislative design “to \nprotect  an  incumbent  who  was  not  the  candidate  of \nchoice of those Latino voters.” C.J.S. 191a. \n\nThe court based its finding on a meticulous exami-\nnation of the extensive trial evidence, including testi-\nmony  from  the  mapdrawers  themselves.  See  Supp. \nApp. 287a-300a; C.J.S. App. 191a-92a. The mapdraw-\ners  were  well  aware  that  Representative  Farenthold \nwould likely not survive reelection in majority-Latino \nbenchmark  CD27,  so  they  reoriented  the  district  to \npave  the  way  to  his  victory  and  ensure  defeat  of  the \nLatino-preferred candidate. In the Legislature’s view, \nthe long-acknowledged voting rights of Nueces County \nLatinos  had  to  be  sacrificed  because  they  voted  the \nwrong  way.  See  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  440 \n(2006)  (“In  essence  the  State  took  away  the  Latinos’ \nopportunity because Latinos were about to exercise it. \nThis bears the mark of intentional discrimination[.]”). \n\nThe  State  does  not  even  attempt  to  justify  the \nLegislature’s  decision  to  carve  out  Nueces  County \nLatinos from their previous majority-minority district \nin  service  of  Farenthold’s  reelection.  To  be  sure,  this \nCourt has already rejected the State of Texas’s argu-\nment  that  vote  dilution  is  an  acceptable  means  of \nincumbency protection. See LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. \nat 440-41. Over a decade ago, Texas argued that the \nreason  for  excising  Latino  voters  from  CD23  was  to \nprotect the incumbent “from a constituency that was \nincreasingly  voting  against  him.”  Id.  at  440.  This \n\n \n\f46 \n\nCourt clarified that incumbency protection may not be \npursued at all costs. \n\nIf the justification for incumbency protection \nis  to  keep  the  constituency  intact  so  the \nofficeholder is accountable for promises made \nor broken, then the protection seems to accord \nwith  concern  for  the  voters.  If,  on  the  other \nhand,  incumbency  protection  means  exclud-\ning  some  voters  from  the  district  simply \nbecause  they  are  likely  to  vote  against  the \nofficeholder,  the  change  is  to  benefit  the \nofficeholder,  not  the  voters.  By  purposely \nredrawing  lines  around  those  who  opposed \n[the  incumbent],  the  state  legislature  took  \nthe  latter  course.  This  policy,  whatever  its \nvalidity in the realm of politics, cannot justify \nthe effect on Latino voters. \n\nId.  at  441.  Indeed,  similar  to  LULAC  v.  Perry,  the \nlegislative  policy  here  “becomes  even  more  suspect,” \nid., when considered in light of the evidence that the \nState “replaced” CD27 with CD35 in purported satis-\nfaction  of  §2  knowing  full  well  that  the  contorted \nextension  into  Travis  County  had  no  §2  basis.  See \nsupra  Part  III;  C.J.S.  App.  178a  (“In  this  way,  they \nwere  able  to  create  the  facade  of  complying  with  §2 \nwhile  actually  minimizing  the  number  of  districts  in \nwhich minorities could elect their candidates of choice \ndespite the massive minority population growth that \nhad occurred throughout the state.”); LULAC v. Perry, \n548 U.S. at 441 (“This use of race to create the facade \nof a Latino district also weighs in favor of appellants’ \nclaim.”).  \n\nNotwithstanding the testimony from the mapdraw-\ners,  the  State  contends  that  the  real  motivation  for \nincluding Nueces County in majority-Anglo CD27 was \n\n \n\f47 \n\n“to  keep  Nueces  County  whole  as  the  anchor  of  a \ncongressional  district”  while  establishing  a  new  dis-\ntrict  anchored  in  Cameron  County.  Br.  51,  53.25  In \nparticular,  the  State  points  to  “hearings  held  before \nthe  2011  legislative  session”  as  the  source  for  the \nreorientation  of  Nueces  County  and  the  concomitant \nelectoral  isolation  of  its  206,000  Latino  residents.  \nBr. 51. But the district court pored over the abundant \ntestimony  from  those  hearings  and  found  significant \ninconsistencies with both the State’s proffered expla-\nnation  and  the  resulting  map.  See  Supp.  App.  295a. \nIndeed, “no one suggested” that Nueces County should \nbe  grouped  with  the  host  of  majority-Anglo  counties  \nto its north, id., yet that is precisely the configuration \nthe  mapdrawers  chose—and  precisely  the  means  of \ndiluting  the  vote  of  Nueces  County  Latinos.  C.J.S. \nApp. 189a-190a.  \n\nThe State’s contention that it was driven by a desire \nfor Nueces County to anchor a district is further belied \nby the actual configuration and performance of CD27. \nWhile  Nueces  County  voters  controlled  the  outcome  \nof  CD27  elections  in  the  benchmark  plan,  see  Supp. \n\n25  The  State’s  citation  to  Personnel  Administrator  of \nMassachusetts v. Feeney as the governing standard for discrim-\ninatory intent conveniently omits two important qualifiers. First, \nthe  Feeney  test  asks  whether  the  government  decision  was  “at \nleast  in  part  ‘because  of’”  its  adverse  effects  on  an  identifiable \ngroup. 442 U.S. 256, 279 (1979) (emphasis added). Feeney further \nnotes  that  when  the  adverse  consequences  of  the  law  at  issue  \non  an  identifiable  group—here,  minority  voters—are  virtually \ninevitable,  “a  strong  inference  that  the  adverse  effects  were \ndesired  can  reasonably  be  drawn.”  Id.  at  279  n.25.  Where  the \nState  equated  minorities  with  Democrats,  and  then  used  the \ndivision of minority communities as the tool to harm Democrats, \nthe inference is unavoidable that the adverse effects on minorities \nalso were intended. \n\n \n                                                            \n\f48 \n\nApp.  296a  (“In  benchmark  CD27,  Nueces  County’s \nregistered  voters  made  up  just  over  50%  of  the  total \nregistered  voters.”);  Rod.  Ex.  955  (63.3  percent  of  \nvotes cast in 2010 general election in benchmark CD27 \nwere from Nueces County), Nueces County voters lost \ncontrol of the election once the district was reoriented \nto include “twelve heavily Anglo Central Texas coun-\nties,”  Supp.  App.  294a,  296a  (“In  new  CD27,  Nueces \nCounty voters are no longer the majority of registered \nvoters  in  the  district.”);  Rod.  Ex.  956  (65.1  percent  \nof  votes  cast  in  2012  general  election  in  CD27  were \nfrom outside Nueces County). Indeed, the mapdrawers  \n“did no analysis to see whether Nueces County could \ncontrol the election in the new CD27 and did not know \nif it could.” Supp. App. 296a. The fact that mapdrawers \nmanaged  to  fail  in  meeting  what  the  State  now \nproffers  as  the  main  goal  driving  CD27  reveals  the \npretextual nature of that claim.26 \n\nThe  State’s  alternative  explanation  for  the  con-\nfiguration  of  CD27  was  thoroughly  considered  and \nultimately  rejected  by  the  district  court.  C.J.S.  App. \n193a. Even if the State’s argument found some support \nin the record, the State provides this Court no basis for \nfinding “clear error.” See Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1465 (“A \nfinding that is ‘plausible’ in light of the full record—\neven if another is equally or more so—must govern.”) \n(quoting Anderson v. Bessemer City, 470 U.S. 564, 575 \n\n26  The  State’s  contention  that  there  were  other  ways  “a \nnefarious  mapdrawer”  could  have  diluted  the  vote  of  Nueces \nCounty  Latinos  hardly  exonerates  it  for  choosing  its  preferred \nmethod of vote dilution. Br. 53. The dilution of minority voting \nstrength  “may  be  caused  by  the  dispersal  of  [Latinos]  into  dis-\ntricts in which they constitute an ineffective minority of voters,” \nas was done in CD27, “or from the concentration of [Latinos] into \ndistricts  where  they  constitute  an  excessive  majority.”  Gingles, \n478 U.S. at 46 n.11 (emphasis added). \n\n \n                                                            \n\f49 \n\n(1985)); see also Anderson, 470 U.S. at 573-74 (“If the \ndistrict court’s account of the evidence is plausible in \nlight of the record viewed in its entirety, the court of \nappeals may not reverse it even though convinced that \nhad  it  been  sitting  as  the  trier  of  fact,  it  would  have \nweighed the evidence differently. Where there are two \npermissible  views  of  the  evidence,  the  factfinder’s \nchoice  between  them  cannot  be  clearly  erroneous.”). \nThis  longstanding  rule  of  deference  is  surely  applic-\nable  here,  where  the  district  court’s  ultimate  conclu-\nsion of discriminatory intent came after it heard weeks \nof  testimony  and  made  credibility  determinations  of \nmultiple  decisionmakers  central  to  the  design  of  the \nchallenged districts. See Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1478 (“A \nchoice to believe ‘one of two or more witnesses, each of \nwhom has told a coherent and facially plausible story \nthat  is  not  contradicted  by  extrinsic  evidence,’  can \n‘virtually  never  be  clear  error.’”)  (quoting  Anderson, \n470 U.S. at 575).  \n\nUltimately,  the  mapdrawers  themselves  acknowl-\nedged that creating a separate Cameron County-based \ndistrict,  protecting  Representative  Farenthold,  and \nrespecting  the  §2  voting  rights  of  Nueces  County \nLatinos  was  not  a  zero  sum  game.  See  Supp.  App. \n297a. Despite the multitude of options, and consistent \nwith their statewide approach of using race to achieve \nmaximum political gain for Anglo Republicans, map-\ndrawers chose the one configuration that unnecessarily \nisolates  Nueces  County  Latinos  from  an  opportunity \ndistrict and drowns out their electoral power in Anglo-\ndominated CD27. \n\nB.  CD27 Violates § 2’s Effects Test \n\nRegardless  of  the  motivation  behind  CD27,  the \ndiscriminatory  impact  on  Latino  voters  in  Nueces \n\n \n\f50 \n\nCounty  who  have  been  unlawfully  deprived  of  the \nequal  opportunity  to  elect  their  candidates  of  choice \nin  CD27.  The  “approximately  200,000 \npersists \nHispanic voters in Nueces County (a majority-HCVAP \ncounty)  [who]  had  a  §2  right  that  could  be  remedied \nbut was not” have suffered from the practical effects of \nvote dilution in every election held this decade. C.J.S. \nApp. 181a. \n\nAfter examining each of the necessary elements for \na §2 violation, the district court found that CD27 “has \nthe effect of diluting Nueces County Hispanic voters’ \nelectoral  opportunity,”  C.J.S.  App.  190a-91a.  Specifi-\ncally,  it  found  that  (1)  “a  district  could  be  drawn  in \nwhich Hispanics, including Nueces County Hispanics, \nare sufficiently numerous and geographically compact \nto  constitute  a  majority  HCVAP”;  (2)  “racially  polar-\nized voting exists such that an Anglo-majority would \nusually  defeat”  the  Latino-preferred  candidate;  and  \n(3)  “[a]  searching  practical  evaluation  of  ‘past  and \npresent reality’ and a functional view of the political \nprocesses indicates that the political processes are not \nequally open to Hispanics.” Id. 190a. \n\nThe State does not dispute that the discriminatory \neffects  of  CD27  “may  be  carried  over  .  .  .  from  one \nversion of a law to another.” Br. 31-32. It argues only \nthat Plan C235’s incorporation of seven Latino oppor-\ntunity districts in south/west Texas satisfies the first \nprong  of  the  Gingles  test  and  therefore  forecloses  a  \n§2 claim. Br. 49-50. To be sure, Appellants, Appellees, \nand the district court all agree that §2 requires seven \nLatino  opportunity  districts  in  the  area.  See  C.J.S. \nApp.  112a.  But  that  conclusion  is  the  beginning,  not \nthe end, of the §2 inquiry. \n\nThe  State’s  argument  falters  because  it  fails  to \naccount  for  the  invalid  racial  gerrymander  of  CD35. \n\n \n\f51 \n\nThe  State  itself  acknowledges  that  to  establish  the \neffects prong of a vote dilution claim, a plaintiff must \nprove  that  there  is  “‘the  possibility  of  creating  more \nthan  the  existing  number  of  reasonably  compact \ndistricts with a sufficiently large minority population \nto  elect  candidates  of  [the  minority  group’s]  choice.’” \nBr.  49  (quoting  LULAC  v.  Perry,  548  U.S.  at  430) \n(emphasis added). Once the CD35 constitutional viola-\ntion is unraveled, removing the Travis County Latinos \nthat were gerrymandered into the district, the “exist-\ning  number”  of  Latino  opportunity  districts  falls  one \nshort of the undisputed §2 requirement, and a Latino \nopportunity  district  still  must  be  established  some-\nwhere  in  the  South  and  West  Texas  envelope  to \nreplace  it.  This  means  that  Nueces  County  and  its \nlarge Latino population must be pulled back into the \nenvelope in order to satisfy the State’s §2 obligation. \nSee  Supp.  App.  300a  (“Including  the  population  of \nNueces County in the envelope makes it easier to draw \nseven  Latino  opportunity  districts  under  §2  without \nincluding Travis County.”). \n\nThis is the very thing the Legislature chose not to do \nwhen  it  designed  CDs  27  and  35.  It  took  Nueces \nCounty  Latinos  who  had  a  §2  right  and  put  them  in  \nan Anglo-dominated district where their rights could \nnot be exercised. In exchange, mapdrawers carved up \nTravis County racially, placing nearly 150,000 Travis \nCounty  Latinos  in  CD35,  even  though  they  did  not \nhave  a  §2  right.  In  short,  it  engineered  a  trade  that \ntook §2 rights from those who have them to provide a \n§2 remedy to those who do not. LULAC v. Perry holds \nthat such a trade is itself a §2 violation. \n\nThe  Court  has  rejected  the  premise  that  a \nState can always make up for the less-than-\nequal  opportunity  of  some  individuals  by \n\n \n\f52 \n\nproviding  greater  opportunity  to  others.  .  .  . \n[T]hese  conflicting  concerns  are  resolved  \nby  allowing  the  State  to  use  one  majority-\nminority  district  to  compensate  for  the \nabsence of another only when the racial group \nin each area had a §2 right and both could not \nbe accommodated. \n\n548 U.S. at 429. “Simply put, the State’s creation of an \nopportunity district for those without a §2 right offers \nno  excuse  for  its  failure  to  provide  an  opportunity \ndistrict  for  those  with  a  §2  right.”  C.J.S.  App.  181a \n(quoting LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. at 430).  \n\nThe  State  offers  little  in  response  to  the  obvious \nparallels  to  LULAC  v.  Perry.  According  to  the  State, \nbecause  the  trade  in  LULAC  v.  Perry  was  deemed \nunlawful for the new district’s failure to comply with \nthe first Gingles prong, it has no bearing here, where \nthe district court found the new district (CD35) failed \nto comply with the third Gingles prong. Br. 50. This is \na distinction without a difference. This Court’s holding \nin LULAC v. Perry rests not on the presence or absence \nof  a  specific  precondition  but  on  the  presence  or \nabsence of “a §2 right.” 548 U.S. at 430; see also Shaw \nII, 517 U.S. at 917 (“The vote-dilution injuries suffered \nby  [individuals  with  a  §2  right]  are  not  remedied  by \ncreating a safe majority-[minority] district somewhere \nelse in the State.”). Texas’s failure to grapple with the \nbasis for the district court’s §2 effects ruling is fatal to \nits appeal of the §2 invalidation of CD27. “Under § 2, \nthe State must be held accountable for the effect of [its] \nchoices in denying equal opportunity to Latino voters.” \nLULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. at 441-42 (emphasis added). \n\n \n \n \n\f53 \n\nCONCLUSION \n\nFor  the  foregoing  reasons,  as  well  as  the  reasons \nprovided by the district court, this Court should either \ndismiss  this  case  for  lack  of  jurisdiction  or,  alterna-\ntively, affirm the Order on Plan C235 entered by the \ndistrict court on August 15, 2017. \n\nJOSÉ GARZA \nMARTIN GOLANDO \nGARZA GOLANDO  \nMORAN, PLLC \n\n115 E Travis St., Ste. 1235 \nSan Antonio, TX 78205 \n\nCounsel for Appellee \nMexican American \nLegislative Caucus, Texas \nHouse of Representatives \n\nDAVID RICHARDS \nRICHARDS, RODRIGUEZ & \n\nSKEITH, LLP \n\n816 Congress Ave., Ste. 1200 \nAustin, TX 78701 \n\nCounsel for Appellees \n\nShannon Perez, et al. \n\nALLISON J.
