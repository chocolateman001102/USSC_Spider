        "1\n\nSTATEMENT OF INTEREST OF THE \nAMICI CURIAE1\n\nAmici curiae are the States of Louisiana, Alabama,\nMichigan,  Missouri,  Ohio,  South  Carolina,  and\nWisconsin.  The States have a vital interest in the law\nregarding redistricting, since redistricting is inherently\na State function.  The District Court’s ruling, throwing\nelections into disarray, has widespread implications for\nStates entering the 2018 election cycle and the coming\n2020 redistricting cycle, destabilizing the democratic\nsystem in all States. Additionally, the District Court’s\nruling undermines the ability of States to rely in good\nfaith on the plain language of a District Court opinion.\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nThe State of Texas has requested that this Court\nshould note probable jurisdiction or summarily reverse\nthe District Court’s decision to invalidate its own Plan\nC235.  The  need  to  even  make  this  request  is\nremarkable.  We  agree  with  Texas’s  request,  as  the\nDistrict  Court’s  decision  not  only  overturns  a  valid\njudicially-drawn  map,  but  also  upends  decades  of\nprecedent from this Court recognizing States have the\nprimary  duty  of  deciding  the  political  question  of\ndistrict maps and flips the burden to a State to prove to\n\n1 Pursuant to Sup. Ct. R. 37.6, amici curiae and its counsel state\nthat none of the parties to this case nor their counsel authored this\nbrief  in  whole  or  in  part,  nor  made  a  monetary  contribution\nspecifically  for  the  preparation  or  submission  of  this  brief.  The\nState of Louisiana paid for this brief. Amici curiae file this brief\nwith the written consent of all parties, copies of which are on file\nin the Clerk’s Office. All parties received timely notice  of amici\ncuriaes’ intention to file this brief.",
        "2\n\na court that the District Court’s own map contained no\nintent  adverse  to  the  Constitution  and  the  Voting\nRights Act (“VRA”). This is, plain and simple, an attack\non the fundamental sovereignty of States. Nothing in\nthe  VRA  establishes  any  standard  by  which  a  State\nmust hold debate on a legislative map, particularly one\ndrawn  by  a  court  itself  for  the  express  purpose  of\ncomplying  with  the  laws.  Moreover,  congressional\ndistricts  35  and  27—the  remaining  congressional\ndistricts from the 2011 map—did not violate the VRA\nas neither was an impermissible gerrymander, nor was\nit  possible  to  draw  an  additional  majority-minority\ndistrict in Texas. For the foregoing reasons, this Court\nshould note probable jurisdiction or summarily reverse\nthe District Court’s decision.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nI.\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY IMPROPERLY\n“LOCKING IN” A FINDING OF UNLAWFUL INTENT\nFROM A 2011 LEGISLATIVE ACT.\n\nThe District Court concluded the Texas Legislature\npossessed a discriminatory purpose in violation of § 2\nand the Fourteenth Amendment by furthering the 2013\nplan,  which  had  been  drawn  and  ordered  to  be\nimplemented  by  that  very  court.2  Specifically,  the\nDistrict  Court  stated  that  the  decision  to  adopt  the\n2013 plan was “not an attempt to adopt plans that fully\ncomplied with the VRA and the Constitution,” but was\n\n2  The  District  Court  adopted  the  same  flawed  thinking  when  it\nreviewed  Texas’  State  districting  plan.  See  Perez  v.  Abbott,  No.\nSA-11-CV-360, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136226. Amici address this\nflawed  reasoning  in  Amici’s  The  State  of  Louisiana,  et  al.,\nJurisdictional Statement in Abbott v. Perez, No. 17A245 (2017).",
        "3\n\nmerely “a litigation strategy designed to insulate the\n2011 or 2013 plans from further challenge, regardless\nof  their  legal  infirmities.”  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  WL\n3495922 *35, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129982 (W.D. Tex.\nAug. 15, 2017) (hereinafter “Order Overturning Plan\nC235”). The District Court reached this conclusion by\nreasoning  that  the  “discriminatory  taint”  it  found\npresent  in  the  2011  plan  had  not  been  removed  by\nenactment  of  the  court’s  2013  Plan  because  “specific\nportions  of  the  2011  plans  that  [it]  found  to  be\ndiscriminatory or unconstitutional racial gerrymanders\ncontinue unchanged in the 2013 plans” and therefore\nillegally  further  existing  intentional  discrimination.\nOrder Overturning Plan C235 *33, 39.\n\nThe District Court’s conclusion rests on an improper\napplication of law, circular reasoning, and speculation.\nThe  Court  glosses  over  the  fact  that  the  2013  Plan,\nregardless of whether it shares some district lines with\nthe  2011  Plan,  was  found  by  that  same  court  to\nexpressly comply with the standards set forth in Perry\nv. Perez, 565 U.S. 388 (2012), § 2, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Perez v. Perry, 891 F. Supp. 2d 808 (W.D.\nTex. 2012) (hereinafter “Order Adopting Plan C235”).\nIn drawing and ordering the adoption of the 2013 Plan\nthe District Court went to great lengths to emphasize\nthat it was aware of the guidance set forth by Supreme\nCourt’s ruling in Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388 (2012),\nand that the plan complied therewith. Order Adopting\nPlan C235 at 816.\n\nIn accordance with this guidance, the District Court\nindependently  reviewed  “as  much  of  the  record  as\npossible,”  concluded  the  2013  Plan  resolved  the  §  5\nclaims  and  that  “no  §  2  or  Fourteenth  Amendment",
        "4\n\nclaims  preclude[d]  its  acceptance,”  and  ordered  the\nLegislature to adopt it. Order Adopting Plan C235 at\n825. This represents a careful expression by the Court\nthat it drew a plan free from the legal defects present\nin the 2011 Plan.\n\nfree \n\nintent \n\nfollows  that \n\nconstitutional  and \nintent.  It \n\nThis  is  not  an  instance  where  a  legislature\nintentionally  adopted  a  plan  which  has  an  invidious\nindicates.  The\npurpose,  as  the  District  Court \nLegislature  has  not  reenacted  an \nintentionally\ndiscriminatory  plan.  Rather,  the  Legislature  merely\nadopted a plan that was judicially drawn and judicially\nfrom\napproved  as \nfor  the\ndiscriminatory \nLegislature  to  be  furthering  preexisting  intentional\ndiscrimination, the District Court itself would have to\npossess  discriminatory \nin  drawing  and\napproving the plan, despite its clear statement that the\nplan  was  designed  to  eliminate  any  underlying  legal\ndefects. Indeed, a court-drawn map, such as the 2013\nPlan,  is  subject  to  a  far  higher  standard  than  one\ndrawn by a legislature. See, e.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437\nU.S. 535, 541 (1978) (noting that courts lack “political\nauthoritativeness” and must act “in a manner free from\nany taint of arbitrariness or discrimination” in drawing\nremedial districts) (quoting Connor v. Finch, 431 U.S.\n408, 417 (1977)); Wyche v. Madison Par. Police Jury,\n769 F.2d 265, 268 (5th Cir. 1985) (“Many factors, such\nas the protection of incumbents, that are appropriate in\nthe legislative development of an apportionment plan\nhave  no  place  in  a  plan  formulated  by  the  courts.”);\nWyche  v.  Madison  Par.  Police  Jury,  635  F.2d  1151,\n1160 (5th Cir. 1981) (noting that “a court is forbidden\nto take into account the purely political considerations\nthat  might  be  appropriate  for  legislative  bodies”);",

Mar.  12,  2012),  report  and\nrecommendation adopted as modified, No. 11-cv-5632,\n2012  WL  928223,  at  *6  (E.D.N.Y  Mar.  19,  2012);\nMolina  v.  Cty.  of  Orange,  No.  13CV3018,  2013  WL\n3039589, at *8 (S.D.N.Y. June 3, 2013), supplemented,\nNo. 13CV3018, 2013 WL 3039741 (S.D.N.Y. June 13,\n2013), report and recommendation adopted, No. 13 CIV.\n3018 ER, 2013 WL 3009716 (S.D.N.Y. June 14, 2013);\nLarios  v.  Cox,  306  F.  Supp.  2d  1214,  1218  (N.D.  Ga.\n2004);  Balderas  v.  Texas,  No.  6:01CV158,  2001  WL\n36403750, at *4 (E.D. Tex. Nov. 14, 2001). The fact that\nthe 2013 Plan may share some lines with the 2011 Plan\nis  of  no  legal  significance  because  the  District  Court\nadopted those lines as its own. \n\nGiven the clear, express conclusion of the District\nCourt  in  2012,  paired  with  the  guidance  in  Perry  v.\nPerez, it was logical for some portions of the 2011 Plan\nto remain in the 2013 Plan and it was similarly logical\nfor  the  2013  Plan  to  be  adopted  by  the  Legislature\nwithout change. The discriminatory intent the Court\nfound in the 2011 Plan cannot logically or legally be\nsaid  to  have  carried  over  to  the  2013  Plan  merely\nbecause  some  portions  of  the  2011  Plan  are\nencompassed  therein.  Indeed,  the  Supreme  Court\ninstructed the District Court and Legislature to look to\nthe legal portions of the 2011 Plan in building a new\nplan and the District Court found that the 2013 Plan\ncomplied with the Supreme Court’s standards. Order\nAdopting Plan C235 at 838. Simply put, the 2013 Plan\nis  a  new  plan,  untainted  by  any  underlying\ndiscriminatory purpose or intent from the 2011 Plan\nbecause  the  District  Court’s  findings  and  orders  in",
        "6\n\n2012 necessarily removed any “taint.” See string cite,\nsupra at 4–5.\n\nWith the presumption of constitutionality afforded\nto legislative acts, none of the findings that the District\nCourt makes aid in its conclusion that the Legislature\nintentionally  furthered  pre-existing  discriminatory\npurpose  in  enacting  the  2013  Plan.  On  the  contrary,\nthe District Court’s findings as to intent serve only to\nundercut  its  own  conclusions.  As  the  District  Court\nnotes, the Legislature adopted the 2013 Plan and, in an\napparent  effort  to  avoid  further  litigation,  did  not\namend  it.  How  could  the  Legislature  wish  to  avoid\nfurther litigation if it  was adopting a plan supposedly\nrife with legal infirmities? The District Court’s illogical\nsupposition that the Legislature adopted the 2013 Plan\nas  part  of  a  trial  strategy  is  bizarre  but,  if  true,  it\nshould actually stand against the proposition that the\nLegislature  was  intentionally  furthering  an  existent\npurposeful discrimination.\n\nIf the District Court is allowed to impute the intent\nof the Legislature when enacting the 2011 Plan onto a\ndifferent act, the enactment of the Court-ordered 2013\nPlan, potential ramifications flow well beyond this case.\nThe District Court’s holding essentially stands for the\nproposition that any legislative enactment once found\nto have been motivated by what a court deems to be\ndiscriminatory intent, can never be cured – even when\nnew maps rely upon a court order. If this circular logic\nstands,  it  will  work  extreme  unfairness  to  States  by\ncalling into question the finality of judgments. States\nwill never be sure if court orders are valid or reliable\nand  therefore  risk  years  of  ongoing \nlitigation.\nMoreover,  such  reasoning  would  require  legislatures",
        "7\n\nsimilarly situated to scrap existing maps and redraw\nall of their electoral districts. A comprehensive redraw\nwould occur at enormous cost to taxpayers and would\nslow the legislative process to an unnecessary crawl. \n\nThe District Court improperly imputed the finding\nof unlawful intent from the 2011 Plan onto the 2013\nPlan, thereby invalidating the very plan that it drew,\napproved,  and  ordered  enacted.  Plainly  stated,  the\n2013 Plan is a new plan, cleansed of any discriminatory\n“taint” by the District Court’s earlier finding that the\nplan  was  free  from  constitutional  violations  and\nviolations of the VRA.\n\nII.\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY HOLDING THE\nLEGISLATURE’S DELIBERATIVE PROCESS TO AN\nUNDEFINED  QUALITATIVE  OR  QUANTITATIVE\nSTANDARD.\n\nThe  District  Court  erred  by  manufacturing  new\nrequirements  by  suggesting  the  Legislature  did  not\nengage  in  a  sufficiently  robust  deliberative  process.\nFirst, no such deliberative process is required by any\nfederal or state law. Second, even if such a process was\nrequired, the Legislature fulfilled those requirements\nby passing the very map drawn by the same District\nCourt.\n\nA. The  Voting  Rights  Act  and  General\nPrinciples  of  Judicial  Review  Require\nJudicial Deference to the Decisions of a\nState Legislature. \n\nIn reviewing the actions of a state legislature on any\nsubject,  a  court  should  start  from  a  position  of\ndeference, rather than suspicion. Here, however, the\nlower court not only withheld the deference due on the",

Holder,  133  S.  Ct.  2612,  2623  (2013)\n(quoting Perry, 565 U.S. at 392). “Reapportionment is\nprimarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  the  State\nthrough its legislature or other body, rather than of a\nfederal court.” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 156\n(1993).  Because  the  “States  do  not  derive  their\nreapportionment authority from the Voting Rights Act,\nbut  rather  from  independent  provisions  of  state  and\nfederal law,” the federal courts are bound to respect the\nStates’  apportionment  choices  unless  those  choices\ncontravene federal requirements.

[A\ncourt’s]  task,  instead,  is  to  determine  whether  the\nlegislature’s actions violated federal law.” Martinez v.\nBush, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1298 (S.D. Fla. 2002). “The\ncourts, in assessing the sufficiency of a challenge to a",

Johnson, 515 U.S. 900,\n915-16  (1995).  Only  when  race  is  the  “predominant\nfactor  motivating \nlegislature’s  redistricting\ndecision” will strict scrutiny apply. Bush v. Vera, 517\nU.S. 952, 959 (1996).\n\nthe \n\nThis  series  of  specific  limits  as  to  federal  court\noversight  on  redistricting  plans  should  be  applied  to\nthis case without further explanation. However, even\non  matters  of  policy  and  fact-finding  generally,  this\nCourt has also long extended significant deference to\nstate legislatures. “States are not required to convince\nthe  courts  of  the  correctness  of  their  legislative\njudgments.  Rather,  ‘those  challenging  the  legislative\njudgment must convince the court that the legislative\nfacts  on  which  the  classification  is  apparently  based\ncould  not  reasonably  be  conceived  to  be  true  by  the\ngovernmental  decision  maker.’”  Minnesota  v.

So long as there is “evidence before the\nlegislature reasonably supporting the classification,” a\nduly  enacted  piece  of  legislation  should  not  be\ninvalidated  even  if  a  challenger  could  “tender[]\nevidence in court that the legislature was mistaken” Id;\nsee  also  Nathaniel  Persily,  When  Judges  Carve\nDemocracies: A Primer on Court-Drawn Redistricting\nPlans, Faculty Scholarship, Paper 74 (2005), available\nat http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship\n/74.

In the\nabsence  of  some  alleged  violation  of  that  process,  no\nknown precedent supports measuring how long or how\ndeeply a legislature “deliberates” on matters it passes. \nThe District Court’s ruling implies some greater duty\nexists  to  “deliberate”  beyond  that  required  by  the\nState’s constitution, but even more disturbingly that a\nfederal court can measure it. \n\nSome state legislatures are full-time and some are\npart-time.

THE  DISTRICT  COURT  RULING  EVISCERATES\nTHE  PRESUMPTIONS  OF  CONSTITUTIONALITY\nAND GOOD FAITH.\n\nfailure \n\nfurther \n\nThe  Court  should  note  jurisdiction  or  summarily\nreverse on the basis that it failed to apply this Court’s\nwell-established principle of the presumption of good\nfaith  accorded  to  legislative  enactments  and  the\nDistrict  Court’s \nto  exercise\nextraordinary  caution.  Instead  of  applying  or  even\nacknowledging  the  long-standing  principle  that  “the\npresumption  of  good  faith  that  must  be  accorded\nlegislative  enactments,”  Miller  v.  Johnson,  515  U.S.\n900, 916 (1995), the District Court, in further failing to\n“exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims\nthat  a  State  has  drawn  district  lines  on  the  basis  of\nrace,” instead chose to declare Plan C235 unlawful by\napplying a presumption of invalidity when the Texas\nLegislature acted on the basis of the District Court’s\nown  ruling.  This  presumption  means  that  plaintiffs,\nnot  the  legislature,  bear  the  “demanding”  burden  of\nshowing \nthe\nlegislative enactment at issue; any doubt or failure on\nplaintiffs’ part to do so must be resolved in favor of the\nstate.  Id. \n\nimpermissible  motivation  behind \n\nThe  District  Court  completely  eviscerated  the\npresumption  of  good  faith  when  it  decided  that  the\nState’s  action  was  unconstitutional.

        "12\n\nusurps one of the most basic political functions of state\nlegislatures.  Following  the  District  Court’s  logic,  the\nfederal  judiciary  may  replace  any  duly  enacted\nreapportionment plan without regard for the discretion\nand judgment used by a state in balancing the many\nintricate  factors  that  go  into  such  a  fundamental\ndemocratic practice. \n\nthat \n\nfederal  courts  must \n\nThe  implications  are  enormous.    If  the  District\nCourt’s ruling is permitted to stand, there is nothing\nleft to bar the federal judiciary’s “serious intrusion on\nthe most vital of local functions,” Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU.S. 900, 915 (1995), and likewise, nothing left of the\n“exercise\nmandate \nextraordinary caution” in redistricting cases and afford\nstates  a  presumption  of  constitutionality  and  good\nfaith.  Miller,  515  U.S.  at  916.  Time  and  again  this\nCourt has similarly held that where legitimate motives\nexist, government action is presumed valid and a court\nmay not automatically infer an unlawful purpose. See,\ne.g., U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 721\n(1990)  (beginning  the  inquiry  by  “noting  the  heavy\npresumption of constitutionality to which a carefully\nconsidered  decision  of  a  coequal  and  representative\nbranch of our Government is entitled.”); McCleskey v.\nKemp,  481  U.S.  279,  298-99  (1987)  (refraining  from\ninferring  discriminatory  purpose  on  the  part  of  the\nstate where the state had legitimate reasons to adopt\nand  maintain  capital  punishment);  United  States  v.\nChem.

Wakefield Twp., 247 U.S. 350,\n353  (1918)  (good  faith  and  validity  of  actions\npresumed).",
        "13\n\nWhat  is  truly  extraordinary  is  that  the  District\nCourt wholly failed to acknowledge its own reasoning\nand analysis in support of the validity of Plan C235 as\na  good  faith  basis  for  Texas’  2013  enactment  and\nimplementation  of  the  Plan.  In  so  doing,  the  Court\nrepudiates its own findings and the lawfulness of its\nown order. Even without additional justification, the\nsimple  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  when  the  Court\nentered an order directing Texas to adopt Plan C235,\nthis  order  alone  constituted  a  legitimate,  good  faith\nbasis for the enactment of the legislation. The record is\nabsent  of  any  basis  on  which  to  infer  that  the  2013\nLegislature had an improper purpose in adopting the\nPlan.  Under  a  proper  application  of  this  Court’s\nprecedent  and  the  presumption  of  good  faith  and\nconstitutionality,  the  District  Court’s  ruling  must  be\noverturned. \n\nThe Legislature’s cautious approach in adopting the\nmost obvious path forward to end the litigation was to\nadopt what the District Court had already found to be\na valid remedy, which included both district lines that\nwere  altered  as  well  as  district  lines  that  the  Court\nfound no basis to change. With the normal presumption\nof validity disemboweled, the District Court found the\nState action of relying upon the constitutionality of the\nDistrict  Court’s  own  order  unconstitutional.  This\nconstitutes clear legal error. \n\nThe District Court further erred when it applied the\nArlington  Heights  factors,  as  the  foundation  for  the\n“official action” of the state is the official action of the\nDistrict Court itself. See Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct.\n1455, 1479-80 (2017) (citing Vill. of Arlington Heights\nv.  Metro.  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  429  U.S.  252  (1977)",
        "14\n\n(standards offered “a varied and non-exhaustive list of\n‘subjects’  of  proper  inquiry  in  determining  whether\nracially  discriminatory  intent  existed’”  while  also\nreaffirming that the Court has “often held” the burden\nof proof on the plaintiff to prove race, not politics, “is\ndemanding.”(citations omitted)). Despite the legislature\nbasing  its  action  on  the  valid  remedy  of  the  District\nCourt, the District Court still faulted it with a finding\nof discriminatory intent. The historical background of\nthe action, the specific sequence of events leading up to\nthe action, and the legislative history of the action all\ncan be directly traced to the action of the District Court\nitself. Cf. Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 266-68. A legislature adopting a\nfederal  District  Court  plan  as  its  own  is  hardly  a\nsubstantive departure from the norm. See id.\n\nThe  Arlington  Heights  framework  guides  how\nfederal  courts  should  go  about  finding  whether  a\ngovernmental  entity  acted  with  discriminatory\npurpose.  Nowhere  within  that  framework  is  there  a\nblank  check  for  federal  courts  to  arbitrarily  find\nconstitutional  violations  on  the  sole  basis  that  they\ndisagree  with  states’  chosen  policies  and  internal\ndemocratic  processes.  Arlington  Heights  states  that,\nwhile the impact of the official action may provide “an\nimportant  starting  point,”  impact  alone  “is  not\ndeterminative  and  the  court  must  look  to  other\nevidence.”  Id.  at  266.  Particularly,  “the  specific\nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  challenged\ndecision  also  may  shed  light  on  the  decisionmaker’s\npurposes.” Id. at 267 (citations omitted). The District\nCourt  here  struck  four  different  state  legislative",
        "15\n\nactions,3  including  the  extraordinary  measure  of  the\nLegislature’s  acquiescence  to  Plan  C235  precisely  as\ndrawn  by  the  District  Court.  For  the  District  Court,\nthere  was  apparently  nothing  the  Texas  legislature\ncould do to remedy the alleged violations. If a District\nCourt  can  hold  a  state \nlegislature  acted\nunconstitutionally  in  adopting  a  court-drawn  plan,\nthere  is  absolutely  nothing  stopping  other  federal\ncourts from inserting themselves into state deliberative\nprocesses  and  holding  states  hostage  to  this  type  of\nlitigation in perpetuity. The precedent established by\nthe District Court, that the judiciary can hold a state in\nsuch a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don’t situation,\nis  a  wholly  inappropriate  overreach  by  the  judiciary\ninto the realm of state sovereign interests. This Court\nhas held that “reapportionment is primarily the duty\nand responsibility of the State,” Chapman v.

See  U.S.\nCensus Bureau, American Fact Finder Annual Estimates of the\nResident Population (2016) (available at https://factfinder.census.\ngov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_20\n16_PEPANNRES&src=pt). A significant driver of the population\ngrowth in Texas is along the IH-35 corridor from the Austin-Round\nRock MSA to the San Antonio-New Braunfels MSA. See Office of\nthe State Demographer, Texas Demographic Center: Urban Texas\n– Part Two (2016) (available at http://demographics.texas.gov/Info\ngraphics/2017/UrbanTexasPt2).",
        "20\n\nbasis, J.S. App. at a113, at the very least should be a\n“good  reason  to  believe”  that  race  was  a  permissible\nfactor in adopting CD35.7 See Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct.\nat 801. Furthermore, there is no basis to believe that\nCD35 is anything like the map struck down in LULAC\nv.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  424-25  (2006).  The  map\nchallenged in LULAC stretched from the Texas/Mexico\nborder and wound its way up to Austin, over 300 miles\naway.  See  Texas  Legislative  Council,  Texas\nRedistricting:  Plan  01374C  (2003)  (available  at\nhttp://www.tlc.state.tx.us/redist/pdf/chronology_plans\n/PLAN01374C.pdf). By comparison, CD35 adjoins two\ncommunities that experienced the significant portion of\nthe State’s population growth as a whole and are only\n80  miles  apart.  Texas  Legislative  Council,  Texas\nRedistricting:  Plan  c235, \n(available  at\nhttp://gis1.tlc.state.tx.us/?PlanHeader=PLANc235).\nTherefore, for the aforementioned reasons, the District\nCourt  erred  when  it  found  CD35  was  a  racial\ngerrymander. \n\n(2013) \n\nV.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 27 DID NOT DILUTE\nMINORITY VOTING STRENGTH BECAUSE IT WAS\nIMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DISTRICT COURT OR THE\nTEXAS LEGISLATURE TO DRAW AN ADDITIONAL\nMAJORITY-MINORITY DISTRICT.\n\nImpermissible vote dilution requires the “effect of\ndiluting minority voting strength.” Shaw, 509 U.S. at\n640. As this Court stated, “a ‘minority group’ must be\n‘sufficiently  large  and  geographically  compact  to\nconstitute  a  majority’  in  some  reasonably  configured\n\n7 This assumes, arguendo, that the Legislature’s approval of the\ninterim  map  can  be  properly  imputed  to  the  State  in  the  first\ninstance.",
        "21\n\nlegislative  district.”  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1470\n(emphasis added) (citing and quoting Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat  50-51)  (internal  citations  omitted).  “Where  an\nelection  district  could  be  drawn  in  which  minority\nvoters  form  a  majority  but  such  a  district  is  not\ndrawn . . . then—assuming the other Gingles factors\nare also satisfied—denial of the opportunity to elect a\ncandidate  of  choice  is  a  present  and  discernible\nwrong . . . .” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 19-20\n(2009). Consequently, if a district cannot be drawn then\nthere can be no wrong. See Id. To assert a claim under\n§  2  the  party  asserting  liability  bears  the  burden  of\nshowing that “the minority population in the potential\nelection district is greater than 50 percent.” Id at 19-20;\nsee also Gonzalez v. Harris County, 601 Fed. Appx. 255,\n258  (5th  Cir.  2015)  (“The  proposed  plan  must  also\nencompass  a  district  with  a  greater-than-50-percent\nvoting-age  minority  population.”).  “The  question  [in\nStrickland is] quantitative, how many—not qualitative,\nwhat kind of people.” Reyes v. City of Farmers Branch\nTex., 586 F.3d 1019, 1023 (5th Cir. 2009) (emphasis in\noriginal). \n\nHere, the Appellees have never shown how the State\ncould  draw  more  than  the  seven  compact  Hispanic\nmajority-minority districts, which is what the current\nplan has.8 See J.S. App. 127a-131a. No matter what the\nin  Nueces\nState  did  with  Hispanic  voters \nCounty—other  than  locking  in  their  district—their\npopulation is insufficient to create a “greater-than-50-\n\n8 The District Court makes the same error in its CD27 analysis as\nin its CD35 analysis, namely that the a county-by-county study is\npermitted when making determinations under § 2 of the VRA. See\nAmici of the States of Louisiana, et al., supra, at 16-18.",
        "22\n\npercent  voting-age”  population.  See  Strickland,  556\nU.S. at 19-20; J.S. App. at 113a. Furthermore, the fact\nthat the Appellees failed to carry their burden should\nend the inquiry resulting in a finding of no vote dilutive\neffect.  See  Strickland,  556  U.S.  at  19-20;  see  also\nGonzalez,  601  Fed.  Appx.  at  258.  The  District  Court\nitself  determined  that  seven  Hispanic  opportunity\ndistricts were required. J.S. App. at 112a. There is no\nrequirement  that  the  State  draw  a  court’s  preferred\ndistricts, instead “it is the domain of the States, and\nnot the federal courts, to conduct apportionment in the\nfirst  place.”  See  Voinovich,  507  U.S.  at  156.  Finally,\nonly “[i]f a State has good reason to think that all the\n‘Gingles preconditions’ are met, then so too it has good\nreason to believe that §2 requires drawing a majority-\nminority district.” Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1470 (emphasis\nadded) (citing Vera, 517 U.S. at 978 (1996)). The State\nhas  two  of  the  best  reasons  one  can  imagine  for\nbelieving  that  Gingles  one  was  not  met  in  this  case:\n1) CD27 and 35 were adopted with the imprimatur of\nthe  District  Court,  and  2)  it  is  not  possible  to\ndemonstrate  an  additional  Hispanic  opportunity\ndistrict is required or even possible in Texas. J.S. App.\n112a  (“The  [District]  Court  found  that  seven  Latino\nopportunity  districts  were  required.  .  .  .”);  J.S.  App.\na127 (“The Supreme Court ruled that a nearly identical\ndistrict [to those the Plaintiffs’ proposed] in the same\nlocation  was  ‘noncompact  for  §2  purposes.’”)  (citing\nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 435. Therefore, the District Court\nerred in finding CD27 impermissibly diluted minority\nvoting strength, and this Court should note jurisdiction\nor  summarily  reverse  to  correct  the  District  Court’s\nerror.",
        "23\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe United States District Court’s decision below to\noverturn its own map, drawn for the express purpose of\ncomplying  with  the  Constitution  and  the  VRA,  is  as\nerroneous  as  it  is  egregious.  In  the  absence  of\nintervening  precedent  by  this  Court  that  would\nabrogate  its  Order  Adopting  Plan  C235,  the  District\nCourt simply cannot issue an order, cause States and\nvoters to act in reliance on that order, and then simply\nchange  its  mind  on  the  eve  of  a  deadline  to  redraw\ndistrict  maps  for  the  2018  elections.  Moreover,  the\nDistrict Court’s arbitrary and suspicious approach to\nthe Legislature’s action stands in blatant disregard to\nthe deference afforded to states on this fundamental\nquestion of state sovereignty. Accordingly, amici curiae\nrespectfully  urge  this  Court  to  note  probable\njurisdiction or summarily reverse the District Court’s\ndecision.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJeff Landry\n  Attorney General\n\nElizabeth B.

The States have a vital interest in the law\nregarding redistricting, since redistricting is inherently\na State function.  The District Court’s ruling, throwing\nelections into disarray, has widespread implications for\nStates entering the 2018 election cycle and the coming\n2020 redistricting cycle, destabilizing the democratic\nsystem in all States. Additionally, the District Court’s\nruling undermines the ability of States to rely in good\nfaith on the plain language of a District Court opinion.\n\nSUMMARY OF ARGUMENT\n\nThe State of Texas has requested that this Court\nshould note probable jurisdiction or summarily reverse\nthe District Court’s decision to invalidate its own Plan\nC235.  The  need  to  even  make  this  request  is\nremarkable.  We  agree  with  Texas’s  request,  as  the\nDistrict  Court’s  decision  not  only  overturns  a  valid\njudicially-drawn  map,  but  also  upends  decades  of\nprecedent from this Court recognizing States have the\nprimary  duty  of  deciding  the  political  question  of\ndistrict maps and flips the burden to a State to prove to\n\n1 Pursuant to Sup. Ct. R. 37.6, amici curiae and its counsel state\nthat none of the parties to this case nor their counsel authored this\nbrief  in  whole  or  in  part,  nor  made  a  monetary  contribution\nspecifically  for  the  preparation  or  submission  of  this  brief.  The\nState of Louisiana paid for this brief. Amici curiae file this brief\nwith the written consent of all parties, copies of which are on file\nin the Clerk’s Office. All parties received timely notice  of amici\ncuriaes’ intention to file this brief.\n\n\f2\n\na court that the District Court’s own map contained no\nintent  adverse  to  the  Constitution  and  the  Voting\nRights Act (“VRA”). This is, plain and simple, an attack\non the fundamental sovereignty of States. Nothing in\nthe  VRA  establishes  any  standard  by  which  a  State\nmust hold debate on a legislative map, particularly one\ndrawn  by  a  court  itself  for  the  express  purpose  of\ncomplying  with  the  laws.  Moreover,  congressional\ndistricts  35  and  27—the  remaining  congressional\ndistricts from the 2011 map—did not violate the VRA\nas neither was an impermissible gerrymander, nor was\nit  possible  to  draw  an  additional  majority-minority\ndistrict in Texas. For the foregoing reasons, this Court\nshould note probable jurisdiction or summarily reverse\nthe District Court’s decision.\n\nARGUMENT\n\nI.\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY IMPROPERLY\n“LOCKING IN” A FINDING OF UNLAWFUL INTENT\nFROM A 2011 LEGISLATIVE ACT.\n\nThe District Court concluded the Texas Legislature\npossessed a discriminatory purpose in violation of § 2\nand the Fourteenth Amendment by furthering the 2013\nplan,  which  had  been  drawn  and  ordered  to  be\nimplemented  by  that  very  court.2  Specifically,  the\nDistrict  Court  stated  that  the  decision  to  adopt  the\n2013 plan was “not an attempt to adopt plans that fully\ncomplied with the VRA and the Constitution,” but was\n\n2  The  District  Court  adopted  the  same  flawed  thinking  when  it\nreviewed  Texas’  State  districting  plan.  See  Perez  v.  Abbott,  No.\nSA-11-CV-360, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 136226. Amici address this\nflawed  reasoning  in  Amici’s  The  State  of  Louisiana,  et  al.,\nJurisdictional Statement in Abbott v. Perez, No. 17A245 (2017).  \n\n\f3\n\nmerely “a litigation strategy designed to insulate the\n2011 or 2013 plans from further challenge, regardless\nof  their  legal  infirmities.”  Perez  v.  Abbott,  2017  WL\n3495922 *35, 2017 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 129982 (W.D. Tex.\nAug. 15, 2017) (hereinafter “Order Overturning Plan\nC235”). The District Court reached this conclusion by\nreasoning  that  the  “discriminatory  taint”  it  found\npresent  in  the  2011  plan  had  not  been  removed  by\nenactment  of  the  court’s  2013  Plan  because  “specific\nportions  of  the  2011  plans  that  [it]  found  to  be\ndiscriminatory or unconstitutional racial gerrymanders\ncontinue unchanged in the 2013 plans” and therefore\nillegally  further  existing  intentional  discrimination.\nOrder Overturning Plan C235 *33, 39.\n\nThe District Court’s conclusion rests on an improper\napplication of law, circular reasoning, and speculation.\nThe  Court  glosses  over  the  fact  that  the  2013  Plan,\nregardless of whether it shares some district lines with\nthe  2011  Plan,  was  found  by  that  same  court  to\nexpressly comply with the standards set forth in Perry\nv. Perez, 565 U.S. 388 (2012), § 2, and the Fourteenth\nAmendment. Perez v. Perry, 891 F. Supp. 2d 808 (W.D.\nTex. 2012) (hereinafter “Order Adopting Plan C235”).\nIn drawing and ordering the adoption of the 2013 Plan\nthe District Court went to great lengths to emphasize\nthat it was aware of the guidance set forth by Supreme\nCourt’s ruling in Perry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388 (2012),\nand that the plan complied therewith. Order Adopting\nPlan C235 at 816.\n\nIn accordance with this guidance, the District Court\nindependently  reviewed  “as  much  of  the  record  as\npossible,”  concluded  the  2013  Plan  resolved  the  §  5\nclaims  and  that  “no  §  2  or  Fourteenth  Amendment\n\n\f4\n\nclaims  preclude[d]  its  acceptance,”  and  ordered  the\nLegislature to adopt it.

This represents a careful expression by the Court\nthat it drew a plan free from the legal defects present\nin the 2011 Plan.\n\nfree \n\nintent \n\nfollows  that \n\nconstitutional  and \nintent.  It \n\nThis  is  not  an  instance  where  a  legislature\nintentionally  adopted  a  plan  which  has  an  invidious\nindicates.  The\npurpose,  as  the  District  Court \nLegislature  has  not  reenacted  an \nintentionally\ndiscriminatory  plan.  Rather,  the  Legislature  merely\nadopted a plan that was judicially drawn and judicially\nfrom\napproved  as \nfor  the\ndiscriminatory \nLegislature  to  be  furthering  preexisting  intentional\ndiscrimination, the District Court itself would have to\npossess  discriminatory \nin  drawing  and\napproving the plan, despite its clear statement that the\nplan  was  designed  to  eliminate  any  underlying  legal\ndefects. Indeed, a court-drawn map, such as the 2013\nPlan,  is  subject  to  a  far  higher  standard  than  one\ndrawn by a legislature. See, e.g., Wise v. Lipscomb, 437\nU.S. 535, 541 (1978) (noting that courts lack “political\nauthoritativeness” and must act “in a manner free from\nany taint of arbitrariness or discrimination” in drawing\nremedial districts) (quoting Connor v.

The fact that\nthe 2013 Plan may share some lines with the 2011 Plan\nis  of  no  legal  significance  because  the  District  Court\nadopted those lines as its own. \n\nGiven the clear, express conclusion of the District\nCourt  in  2012,  paired  with  the  guidance  in  Perry  v.\nPerez, it was logical for some portions of the 2011 Plan\nto remain in the 2013 Plan and it was similarly logical\nfor  the  2013  Plan  to  be  adopted  by  the  Legislature\nwithout change. The discriminatory intent the Court\nfound in the 2011 Plan cannot logically or legally be\nsaid  to  have  carried  over  to  the  2013  Plan  merely\nbecause  some  portions  of  the  2011  Plan  are\nencompassed  therein.  Indeed,  the  Supreme  Court\ninstructed the District Court and Legislature to look to\nthe legal portions of the 2011 Plan in building a new\nplan and the District Court found that the 2013 Plan\ncomplied with the Supreme Court’s standards. Order\nAdopting Plan C235 at 838. Simply put, the 2013 Plan\nis  a  new  plan,  untainted  by  any  underlying\ndiscriminatory purpose or intent from the 2011 Plan\nbecause  the  District  Court’s  findings  and  orders  in\n\n\f6\n\n2012 necessarily removed any “taint.” See string cite,\nsupra at 4–5.\n\nWith the presumption of constitutionality afforded\nto legislative acts, none of the findings that the District\nCourt makes aid in its conclusion that the Legislature\nintentionally  furthered  pre-existing  discriminatory\npurpose  in  enacting  the  2013  Plan.  On  the  contrary,\nthe District Court’s findings as to intent serve only to\nundercut  its  own  conclusions.  As  the  District  Court\nnotes, the Legislature adopted the 2013 Plan and, in an\napparent  effort  to  avoid  further  litigation,  did  not\namend  it.  How  could  the  Legislature  wish  to  avoid\nfurther litigation if it  was adopting a plan supposedly\nrife with legal infirmities? The District Court’s illogical\nsupposition that the Legislature adopted the 2013 Plan\nas  part  of  a  trial  strategy  is  bizarre  but,  if  true,  it\nshould actually stand against the proposition that the\nLegislature  was  intentionally  furthering  an  existent\npurposeful discrimination.\n\nIf the District Court is allowed to impute the intent\nof the Legislature when enacting the 2011 Plan onto a\ndifferent act, the enactment of the Court-ordered 2013\nPlan, potential ramifications flow well beyond this case.\nThe District Court’s holding essentially stands for the\nproposition that any legislative enactment once found\nto have been motivated by what a court deems to be\ndiscriminatory intent, can never be cured – even when\nnew maps rely upon a court order. If this circular logic\nstands,  it  will  work  extreme  unfairness  to  States  by\ncalling into question the finality of judgments. States\nwill never be sure if court orders are valid or reliable\nand  therefore  risk  years  of  ongoing \nlitigation.\nMoreover,  such  reasoning  would  require  legislatures\n\n\f7\n\nsimilarly situated to scrap existing maps and redraw\nall of their electoral districts. A comprehensive redraw\nwould occur at enormous cost to taxpayers and would\nslow the legislative process to an unnecessary crawl. \n\nThe District Court improperly imputed the finding\nof unlawful intent from the 2011 Plan onto the 2013\nPlan, thereby invalidating the very plan that it drew,\napproved,  and  ordered  enacted.  Plainly  stated,  the\n2013 Plan is a new plan, cleansed of any discriminatory\n“taint” by the District Court’s earlier finding that the\nplan  was  free  from  constitutional  violations  and\nviolations of the VRA.\n\nII.\n\nTHE DISTRICT COURT ERRED BY HOLDING THE\nLEGISLATURE’S DELIBERATIVE PROCESS TO AN\nUNDEFINED  QUALITATIVE  OR  QUANTITATIVE\nSTANDARD.\n\nThe  District  Court  erred  by  manufacturing  new\nrequirements  by  suggesting  the  Legislature  did  not\nengage  in  a  sufficiently  robust  deliberative  process.\nFirst, no such deliberative process is required by any\nfederal or state law. Second, even if such a process was\nrequired, the Legislature fulfilled those requirements\nby passing the very map drawn by the same District\nCourt.\n\nA. The  Voting  Rights  Act  and  General\nPrinciples  of  Judicial  Review  Require\nJudicial Deference to the Decisions of a\nState Legislature. \n\nIn reviewing the actions of a state legislature on any\nsubject,  a  court  should  start  from  a  position  of\ndeference, rather than suspicion. Here, however, the\nlower court not only withheld the deference due on the\n\n\f8\n\npolitical question of redistricting, but also failed to give\ndeference to itself and its precedent.\n\nlines \n\nDrawing \n\nfor  congressional  districts \n\nis\n“primarily the duty and responsibility of the State.” See\nShelby  Co.  v.  Holder,  133  S.  Ct.  2612,  2623  (2013)\n(quoting Perry, 565 U.S. at 392). “Reapportionment is\nprimarily  the  duty  and  responsibility  of  the  State\nthrough its legislature or other body, rather than of a\nfederal court.” Voinovich v. Quilter, 507 U.S. 146, 156\n(1993).  Because  the  “States  do  not  derive  their\nreapportionment authority from the Voting Rights Act,\nbut  rather  from  independent  provisions  of  state  and\nfederal law,” the federal courts are bound to respect the\nStates’  apportionment  choices  unless  those  choices\ncontravene federal requirements. Voinovich, 507 U.S.\nat 156 (internal citations omitted). See also Comm. for\na Fair & Balanced Map v. Ill. State Bd. of Elections,\n835 F. Supp. 2d 563, 593 (N.D. Ill. 2011) (refusing to\nreplace a state legislature’s enacted plan “with one that\ninhibits its legitimate objectives while advancing the\nobjectives of the minority political party at the time of\nredistricting.”). \n\n“In any event,” the role of the judiciary “is not to\ndetermine whether the procedural choices made by the\nlegislature  were  the  best  among  a  range  of  options,\nwhether  the  legislative  action  had  to  reflect  the\ntestimony received at the public hearings, or whether\nthe legislature was required to consider that testimony\nor  input  during  its  redistricting  deliberations.  [A\ncourt’s]  task,  instead,  is  to  determine  whether  the\nlegislature’s actions violated federal law.” Martinez v.\nBush, 234 F. Supp. 2d 1275, 1298 (S.D. Fla. 2002). “The\ncourts, in assessing the sufficiency of a challenge to a\n\n\f9\n\nforces \n\nthat  enter  a \n\ndistricting  plan,  must  be  sensitive  to  the  complex\ninterplay  of \nlegislature’s\nredistricting calculus.” Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. 900,\n915-16  (1995).  Only  when  race  is  the  “predominant\nfactor  motivating \nlegislature’s  redistricting\ndecision” will strict scrutiny apply. Bush v. Vera, 517\nU.S. 952, 959 (1996).\n\nthe \n\nThis  series  of  specific  limits  as  to  federal  court\noversight  on  redistricting  plans  should  be  applied  to\nthis case without further explanation. However, even\non  matters  of  policy  and  fact-finding  generally,  this\nCourt has also long extended significant deference to\nstate legislatures. “States are not required to convince\nthe  courts  of  the  correctness  of  their  legislative\njudgments.  Rather,  ‘those  challenging  the  legislative\njudgment must convince the court that the legislative\nfacts  on  which  the  classification  is  apparently  based\ncould  not  reasonably  be  conceived  to  be  true  by  the\ngovernmental  decision  maker.’”  Minnesota  v.  Clover\nLeaf Creamery Co., 449 U.S. 456,463-64 (1981) (quoting\nVance v. Bradley, 440 U.S. 93, 111 (1979) and citing\nDay-Brite Lighting, Inc. v. Missouri, 342 U.S. 421, 425\n(1952) and Henderson Co. v. Thompson, 300 U.S. 258,\n264-65 (1937)). So long as there is “evidence before the\nlegislature reasonably supporting the classification,” a\nduly  enacted  piece  of  legislation  should  not  be\ninvalidated  even  if  a  challenger  could  “tender[]\nevidence in court that the legislature was mistaken” Id;\nsee  also  Nathaniel  Persily,  When  Judges  Carve\nDemocracies: A Primer on Court-Drawn Redistricting\nPlans, Faculty Scholarship, Paper 74 (2005), available\nat http://scholarship.law.upenn.edu/faculty_scholarship\n/74. Based solely on the plain language of the District\nin  the  Order  Adopting  Plan  C235,  the\nCourt \n\n\f10\n\nLegislature  had  ample  evidence  to  suggest  the  plan\nfully  complied  with  all  requirements  of \nthe\nConstitution and the VRA.\n\nB. Even  If  Some  Deliberative  Process  Is\nRequired,  the  Legislature  Fulfilled\nThose  Requirements  by  Passing  the\nCourt-drawn District Map.\n\nAttempting  to  apply  a  time-  or  quality-based\n“deliberation”  standard  pursuant  to  which  a  state\nlegislature must consider district maps is inherently\nflawed. \n\nis \n\nthe \n\nFirst, \n\ninherently\nlegislative  process \n“deliberative,” and it is highly irregular for a federal\ndistrict  court  to  measure  the  amount  of  deliberation\nwithin an inherently deliberative process.  Texas, like\nmost states, follows a legislative process dictated by its\nstate constitution and House and Senate rules. In the\nabsence  of  some  alleged  violation  of  that  process,  no\nknown precedent supports measuring how long or how\ndeeply a legislature “deliberates” on matters it passes. \nThe District Court’s ruling implies some greater duty\nexists  to  “deliberate”  beyond  that  required  by  the\nState’s constitution, but even more disturbingly that a\nfederal court can measure it. \n\nSome state legislatures are full-time and some are\npart-time. Some have aggressive policy agendas based\non  a  newly-elected  governor  or  party  flip  in  the\nmajority, and some have the stability of a multi-term\ngovernor or decades of single-party control. Not only is\nsuch  a  duty  vague  and  unfounded  in  law  or  the\nConstitution,  it  would  be  in  abject  violation  of  this\nCourt’s holdings in Northwest Austin Mun. Util. Dist.\n\n\f11\n\nNo. One v. Holder, 557 U.S. 193, 203 (2009) describing\na “fundamental principle of equal sovereignty” among\nthe States. This Court cannot impose one-size-fits-all\nrequirements on a multitude of sovereign states. \n\nIII. THE  DISTRICT  COURT  RULING  EVISCERATES\nTHE  PRESUMPTIONS  OF  CONSTITUTIONALITY\nAND GOOD FAITH.\n\nfailure \n\nfurther \n\nThe  Court  should  note  jurisdiction  or  summarily\nreverse on the basis that it failed to apply this Court’s\nwell-established principle of the presumption of good\nfaith  accorded  to  legislative  enactments  and  the\nDistrict  Court’s \nto  exercise\nextraordinary  caution.  Instead  of  applying  or  even\nacknowledging  the  long-standing  principle  that  “the\npresumption  of  good  faith  that  must  be  accorded\nlegislative  enactments,”  Miller  v.  Johnson,  515  U.S.\n900, 916 (1995), the District Court, in further failing to\n“exercise extraordinary caution in adjudicating claims\nthat  a  State  has  drawn  district  lines  on  the  basis  of\nrace,” instead chose to declare Plan C235 unlawful by\napplying a presumption of invalidity when the Texas\nLegislature acted on the basis of the District Court’s\nown  ruling.  This  presumption  means  that  plaintiffs,\nnot  the  legislature,  bear  the  “demanding”  burden  of\nshowing \nthe\nlegislative enactment at issue; any doubt or failure on\nplaintiffs’ part to do so must be resolved in favor of the\nstate.  Id. \n\nimpermissible  motivation  behind \n\nThe  District  Court  completely  eviscerated  the\npresumption  of  good  faith  when  it  decided  that  the\nState’s  action  was  unconstitutional.  This  leaves\nnothing  left  of  the  long-standing  presumption  of\nvalidity  afforded  to  state  legislative  enactments  and\n\n\f12\n\nusurps one of the most basic political functions of state\nlegislatures.  Following  the  District  Court’s  logic,  the\nfederal  judiciary  may  replace  any  duly  enacted\nreapportionment plan without regard for the discretion\nand judgment used by a state in balancing the many\nintricate  factors  that  go  into  such  a  fundamental\ndemocratic practice. \n\nthat \n\nfederal  courts  must \n\nThe  implications  are  enormous.    If  the  District\nCourt’s ruling is permitted to stand, there is nothing\nleft to bar the federal judiciary’s “serious intrusion on\nthe most vital of local functions,” Miller v. Johnson, 515\nU.S. 900, 915 (1995), and likewise, nothing left of the\n“exercise\nmandate \nextraordinary caution” in redistricting cases and afford\nstates  a  presumption  of  constitutionality  and  good\nfaith.  Miller,  515  U.S.  at  916.  Time  and  again  this\nCourt has similarly held that where legitimate motives\nexist, government action is presumed valid and a court\nmay not automatically infer an unlawful purpose. See,\ne.g., U.S. Dep’t of Labor v. Triplett, 494 U.S. 715, 721\n(1990)  (beginning  the  inquiry  by  “noting  the  heavy\npresumption of constitutionality to which a carefully\nconsidered  decision  of  a  coequal  and  representative\nbranch of our Government is entitled.”); McCleskey v.\nKemp,  481  U.S.  279,  298-99  (1987)  (refraining  from\ninferring  discriminatory  purpose  on  the  part  of  the\nstate where the state had legitimate reasons to adopt\nand  maintain  capital  punishment);  United  States  v.\nChem.  Found.,  Inc.,  272  U.S.  1,  14-15  (1926)\n(presumption  of  regularity  and  proper  discharge  of\nofficial duties absent clear evidence to the contrary);\nSunday Lake Iron Co. v. Wakefield Twp., 247 U.S. 350,\n353  (1918)  (good  faith  and  validity  of  actions\npresumed).\n\n\f13\n\nWhat  is  truly  extraordinary  is  that  the  District\nCourt wholly failed to acknowledge its own reasoning\nand analysis in support of the validity of Plan C235 as\na  good  faith  basis  for  Texas’  2013  enactment  and\nimplementation  of  the  Plan.  In  so  doing,  the  Court\nrepudiates its own findings and the lawfulness of its\nown order. Even without additional justification, the\nsimple  fact  of  the  matter  is  that  when  the  Court\nentered an order directing Texas to adopt Plan C235,\nthis  order  alone  constituted  a  legitimate,  good  faith\nbasis for the enactment of the legislation. The record is\nabsent  of  any  basis  on  which  to  infer  that  the  2013\nLegislature had an improper purpose in adopting the\nPlan.  Under  a  proper  application  of  this  Court’s\nprecedent  and  the  presumption  of  good  faith  and\nconstitutionality,  the  District  Court’s  ruling  must  be\noverturned. \n\nThe Legislature’s cautious approach in adopting the\nmost obvious path forward to end the litigation was to\nadopt what the District Court had already found to be\na valid remedy, which included both district lines that\nwere  altered  as  well  as  district  lines  that  the  Court\nfound no basis to change. With the normal presumption\nof validity disemboweled, the District Court found the\nState action of relying upon the constitutionality of the\nDistrict  Court’s  own  order  unconstitutional.  This\nconstitutes clear legal error. \n\nThe District Court further erred when it applied the\nArlington  Heights  factors,  as  the  foundation  for  the\n“official action” of the state is the official action of the\nDistrict Court itself. See Cooper v. Harris, 137 S. Ct.\n1455, 1479-80 (2017) (citing Vill. of Arlington Heights\nv.  Metro.  Hous.  Dev.  Corp.,  429  U.S.  252  (1977)\n\n\f14\n\n(standards offered “a varied and non-exhaustive list of\n‘subjects’  of  proper  inquiry  in  determining  whether\nracially  discriminatory  intent  existed’”  while  also\nreaffirming that the Court has “often held” the burden\nof proof on the plaintiff to prove race, not politics, “is\ndemanding.”(citations omitted)). Despite the legislature\nbasing  its  action  on  the  valid  remedy  of  the  District\nCourt, the District Court still faulted it with a finding\nof discriminatory intent. The historical background of\nthe action, the specific sequence of events leading up to\nthe action, and the legislative history of the action all\ncan be directly traced to the action of the District Court\nitself. Cf. Vill. of Arlington Heights v. Metro. Hous. Dev.\nCorp., 429 U.S. 252, 266-68. A legislature adopting a\nfederal  District  Court  plan  as  its  own  is  hardly  a\nsubstantive departure from the norm. See id.\n\nThe  Arlington  Heights  framework  guides  how\nfederal  courts  should  go  about  finding  whether  a\ngovernmental  entity  acted  with  discriminatory\npurpose.  Nowhere  within  that  framework  is  there  a\nblank  check  for  federal  courts  to  arbitrarily  find\nconstitutional  violations  on  the  sole  basis  that  they\ndisagree  with  states’  chosen  policies  and  internal\ndemocratic  processes.  Arlington  Heights  states  that,\nwhile the impact of the official action may provide “an\nimportant  starting  point,”  impact  alone  “is  not\ndeterminative  and  the  court  must  look  to  other\nevidence.”  Id.  at  266.  Particularly,  “the  specific\nsequence  of  events  leading  up  to  the  challenged\ndecision  also  may  shed  light  on  the  decisionmaker’s\npurposes.” Id. at 267 (citations omitted). The District\nCourt  here  struck  four  different  state  legislative\n\n\f15\n\nactions,3  including  the  extraordinary  measure  of  the\nLegislature’s  acquiescence  to  Plan  C235  precisely  as\ndrawn  by  the  District  Court.  For  the  District  Court,\nthere  was  apparently  nothing  the  Texas  legislature\ncould do to remedy the alleged violations. If a District\nCourt  can  hold  a  state \nlegislature  acted\nunconstitutionally  in  adopting  a  court-drawn  plan,\nthere  is  absolutely  nothing  stopping  other  federal\ncourts from inserting themselves into state deliberative\nprocesses  and  holding  states  hostage  to  this  type  of\nlitigation in perpetuity. The precedent established by\nthe District Court, that the judiciary can hold a state in\nsuch a damned-if-you-do damned-if-you-don’t situation,\nis  a  wholly  inappropriate  overreach  by  the  judiciary\ninto the realm of state sovereign interests. This Court\nhas held that “reapportionment is primarily the duty\nand responsibility of the State,” Chapman v. Meier, 420\nU.S.  1,  27  (1975),  and  “[f]ederal-court  review  of\ndistricting legislation represents a serious intrusion on\nthe most vital of local functions,” Miller, 515 U.S. at\n915. The presumption of good faith carries particular\nweight in the context of redistricting legislation, and\nyet Texas was plainly not afforded such a presumption.\nThis Court must refuse to allow the District Court its\nexercise  of  such  unlimited  discretion,  particularly  in\nthis case affecting the most vital of state functions, and\nwhich  profoundly  implicate  state  sovereign  interests\n\n3  The  House  plan  enacted  in  the  regular  session  in  2011;  the\ncongressional  plan  enacted  in  the  special  session  in  2011;  the\nadoption in the 2013 special session of Plan C235 as drawn by the\nDistrict Court; and, most recently, the adoption in 2013 of virtually\nall  of  the  2012  district-court-imposed  map  for  the  Texas  State\nHouse of Representatives.\n\n\f16\n\ntheir \n\nand \nrepresentative democracy.  \n\nindividual  citizens’ \n\ninterests \n\nin\n\nIV.\n\nTHE  DISTRICT  COURT  ERRED  BY  HOLDING\nTHAT DISTRICT 35 IS A RACIAL GERRYMANDER.\n\nA. The  District  Court  Erred  in  Finding\nThat  Congressional  District  35  Is  an\nImpermissible  Racial  Gerrymander  by\nM a k i n g   F a c t u a l   a n d   L e g a l\nDeterminations Based on an Analysis of\nCounties Rather than Districts.\n\nThe District Court further erred by engaging in a\ncounty-by-county  analysis.  In  its  Order  Overturning\nPlan  C235,  the  District  Court  found  that  “Nueces\nCounty  Hispanic  vote[r]s[sic]  were  deprived  of  their\nopportunity to elect candidates of their choice” and that\nadditionally “Travis County does not have Anglo bloc\nvoting  and  thus  does  not  meet  the  third  Gingles\nprecondition.”  J.S. App. 110a. This county-by-county\nstyle analysis is a fundamentally incorrect application\nof Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 50-51 (1986), and\nthis Court’s further precedent. For any analysis to be\nsound under the VRA it must be conducted using the\n“district  as  a  whole”  and  not  any  other  political\nsubdivision as the basis for study. See Bethune-Hill v.\nVa. State Bd. Of Elections, 137 S. Ct. 788, 800 (2017)\n(emphasis added).\n\nDespite  the  clarity  of  the  law,  the  District  Court\nproceeded  to  examine  and  compare  residents  of  two\ndifferent counties without analyzing the congressional\ndistrict they reside in as a whole. This Court clearly\nlaid out the “three threshold conditions” in determining\nimproper vote dilution under § 2 of the VRA. Cooper,\n\n\f17\n\n137 S. Ct. at 1470; see also Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51.\nThe Court in Cooper explained that: “First, a ‘minority\ngroup’  must  be  ‘sufficiently  large  and  geographically\ncompact to constitute a majority’ in some reasonably\nconfigured  legislative  district.  Second,  the  minority\ngroup  must  be  ‘politically  cohesive.’  And  third,  a\ndistrict’s  white  majority  must  ‘vote  sufficiently  as  a\nbloc’  to  usually  ‘defeat  the  minority’s  preferred\ncandidate.’”  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1470  (emphasis\nadded) (citing and quoting Gingles, 478 U.S. at 50-51)\n(internal citations omitted).\n\nFundamentally,  the  purpose  of  the  three  Gingles\npreconditions is to show that “‘the minority [group] has\nthe potential to elect a representative of its own choice’\nin a possible district, but that racially polarized voting\nprevents  it  from  doing  so  in  the  district  as  actually\ndrawn  because  it  is  “submerg[ed]  in  a  larger  white\nvoting  population.’”  Id.  (emphasis  added)  (citing  and\nquoting Growe v. Emison, 507 U.S. 25, 40 (1993)). In\nfact, the long and winding history of VRA legislation\nfocuses on the district as a whole. See Bethune-Hill, 37\nS. Ct. at 800 (2017) (“The ultimate object of the [Voting\nRights  Act]  inquiry,  however,  is  the  legislature’s\npredominant motive for the design of the district as a\nwhole.”) (emphasis added); Ala. Legis. Black Caucus v.\nAlabama, 135 S. Ct. 1257, 1265 (2015) (“Our district-\nspecific language makes sense in light of the nature of\nthe  harms  that  underlie  a  racial  gerrymandering\nclaim.”)  (emphasis  added);  Gingles,  478  U.S.  at  56\n(“The amount of white bloc voting that can generally\n‘minimize  or  cancel’  black  voters’  ability  to  elect\nrepresentatives  of  their  choice  .  .  .  will  vary  from\ndistrict  to  district  .  .  .  .”)  (emphasis  added)  (internal\ncitations omitted); see generally Vera, 517 U.S. at 952\n\n\f18\n\n(1996);  Shaw  v.  Reno,  509  U.S.  630  (1993);  Hunt  v.\nCromartie, 526 U.S. 541, 551-52 (1999). Therefore, this\nCourt  should  note  jurisdiction  or  summarily  reverse\nbecause  the  District  Court  erred  in  its  analysis  of\nCD35. \n\nB. The  State  Was  Required  to  Draw  a\nMajority-Minority  District  in  the  I-35\nCorridor  Due  to  Extensive  Population\nGrowth in That Area.\n\nThe State acted properly when it drew CD35 where\nit did so as a majority-minority district.4 This Court in\nBethune-Hill said:\n\nWhen a State justifies the predominant use of\nrace in redistricting on the basis of the need to\ncomply with the Voting Rights Act, “the narrow\ntailoring  requirement  insists  only  that  the\nlegislature  have  a  strong  basis  in  evidence  in\nsupport  of  the  (race-based)  choice  that  it  has\nmade.” That standard does not require the State\nto  show  that  its  action  was  “actually  .  .  .\nnecessary” to avoid a statutory violation, so that,\nbut for its use of race, the State would have lost\nin  court.  Rather,  the  requisite  strong  basis  in\nevidence exists when the legislature has “good\nreasons to believe” it must use race in order to\nsatisfy  the  Voting  Rights  Act,  “even  if  a  court\n\n4 It is important to note that the 2011 map is not properly before\nthe  Court  because  that  map  is  moot.  This  argument  assumes\narguendo that the 2011 map is properly before the Court; however,\nunder any analysis, the District Court was incorrect to find that\nCD35 is a racial gerrymander.  \n\n\f19\n\ndoes not find that the actions were necessary for\nstatutory compliance.”\n\nBethune-Hill,  137  S.  Ct.  at  801  (emphasis  added)\n(internal citations omitted) (quoting Ala. Legis. Black\nCaucus, 135 S. Ct. at 1274 (2015)). It can hardly be said\nthat the State did not have a “strong basis in evidence”\nor “good reasons to believe” that a Hispanic opportunity\ndistrict was necessary in this area.5 See Bethune-Hill,\n137 S. Ct. at 801. First, the District Court noted the\ntremendous  increase  in  population  the  Austin/San\nAntonio I-35 corridor has seen.6 J.S. App. 408a (“It is\nundisputed  that  much  of  Texas’  overall  population\ngrowth occurred in Bexar County and Travis County\nand  the  areas  along  the  I-35  corridor.”)  (emphasis\nadded). Second, the District Court “found that seven\nLatino opportunity districts were required . . . .”) J.S.\nApp. 112a. And finally, the fact that the District Court\napproved CD35 for use on what it terms an “interim”\n\n5An objection is appropriate for State House District HD90, which\nwas adopted and amended due to objections by a Latino American\ngroup.  Amici  point  the  Court  to  The  State  of  Louisiana,  et  al.,\nJurisdictional Statement in Abbott v. Perez, No. 17A245 (2017) for\na more rigorous analysis. \n\n6 This is a trend that has shown no signs of slowing. Between the\ndecennial  census  and  2016  Texas  experienced  the  greatest\npopulation  increase  of  any  state  in  the  United  States.  See  U.S.\nCensus Bureau, American Fact Finder Annual Estimates of the\nResident Population (2016) (available at https://factfinder.census.\ngov/faces/tableservices/jsf/pages/productview.xhtml?pid=PEP_20\n16_PEPANNRES&src=pt). A significant driver of the population\ngrowth in Texas is along the IH-35 corridor from the Austin-Round\nRock MSA to the San Antonio-New Braunfels MSA. See Office of\nthe State Demographer, Texas Demographic Center: Urban Texas\n– Part Two (2016) (available at http://demographics.texas.gov/Info\ngraphics/2017/UrbanTexasPt2).\n\n\f20\n\nbasis, J.S. App. at a113, at the very least should be a\n“good  reason  to  believe”  that  race  was  a  permissible\nfactor in adopting CD35.7 See Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct.\nat 801. Furthermore, there is no basis to believe that\nCD35 is anything like the map struck down in LULAC\nv.  Perry,  548  U.S.  399,  424-25  (2006).  The  map\nchallenged in LULAC stretched from the Texas/Mexico\nborder and wound its way up to Austin, over 300 miles\naway.  See  Texas  Legislative  Council,  Texas\nRedistricting:  Plan  01374C  (2003)  (available  at\nhttp://www.tlc.state.tx.us/redist/pdf/chronology_plans\n/PLAN01374C.pdf). By comparison, CD35 adjoins two\ncommunities that experienced the significant portion of\nthe State’s population growth as a whole and are only\n80  miles  apart.  Texas  Legislative  Council,  Texas\nRedistricting:  Plan  c235, \n(available  at\nhttp://gis1.tlc.state.tx.us/?PlanHeader=PLANc235).\nTherefore, for the aforementioned reasons, the District\nCourt  erred  when  it  found  CD35  was  a  racial\ngerrymander. \n\n(2013) \n\nV.\n\nCONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT 27 DID NOT DILUTE\nMINORITY VOTING STRENGTH BECAUSE IT WAS\nIMPOSSIBLE FOR THE DISTRICT COURT OR THE\nTEXAS LEGISLATURE TO DRAW AN ADDITIONAL\nMAJORITY-MINORITY DISTRICT.\n\nImpermissible vote dilution requires the “effect of\ndiluting minority voting strength.” Shaw, 509 U.S. at\n640. As this Court stated, “a ‘minority group’ must be\n‘sufficiently  large  and  geographically  compact  to\nconstitute  a  majority’  in  some  reasonably  configured\n\n7 This assumes, arguendo, that the Legislature’s approval of the\ninterim  map  can  be  properly  imputed  to  the  State  in  the  first\ninstance. \n\n\f21\n\nlegislative  district.”  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1470\n(emphasis added) (citing and quoting Gingles, 478 U.S.\nat  50-51)  (internal  citations  omitted).  “Where  an\nelection  district  could  be  drawn  in  which  minority\nvoters  form  a  majority  but  such  a  district  is  not\ndrawn . . . then—assuming the other Gingles factors\nare also satisfied—denial of the opportunity to elect a\ncandidate  of  choice  is  a  present  and  discernible\nwrong . . . .” Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, 19-20\n(2009). Consequently, if a district cannot be drawn then\nthere can be no wrong. See Id. To assert a claim under\n§  2  the  party  asserting  liability  bears  the  burden  of\nshowing that “the minority population in the potential\nelection district is greater than 50 percent.” Id at 19-20;\nsee also Gonzalez v. Harris County, 601 Fed. Appx. 255,\n258  (5th  Cir.  2015)  (“The  proposed  plan  must  also\nencompass  a  district  with  a  greater-than-50-percent\nvoting-age  minority  population.”).  “The  question  [in\nStrickland is] quantitative, how many—not qualitative,\nwhat kind of people.” Reyes v. City of Farmers Branch\nTex., 586 F.3d 1019, 1023 (5th Cir. 2009) (emphasis in\noriginal). \n\nHere, the Appellees have never shown how the State\ncould  draw  more  than  the  seven  compact  Hispanic\nmajority-minority districts, which is what the current\nplan has.8 See J.S. App. 127a-131a. No matter what the\nin  Nueces\nState  did  with  Hispanic  voters \nCounty—other  than  locking  in  their  district—their\npopulation is insufficient to create a “greater-than-50-\n\n8 The District Court makes the same error in its CD27 analysis as\nin its CD35 analysis, namely that the a county-by-county study is\npermitted when making determinations under § 2 of the VRA. See\nAmici of the States of Louisiana, et al., supra, at 16-18. \n\n\f22\n\npercent  voting-age”  population.  See  Strickland,  556\nU.S. at 19-20; J.S. App. at 113a. Furthermore, the fact\nthat the Appellees failed to carry their burden should\nend the inquiry resulting in a finding of no vote dilutive\neffect.  See  Strickland,  556  U.S.  at  19-20;  see  also\nGonzalez,  601  Fed.  Appx.  at  258.  The  District  Court\nitself  determined  that  seven  Hispanic  opportunity\ndistricts were required. J.S. App. at 112a. There is no\nrequirement  that  the  State  draw  a  court’s  preferred\ndistricts, instead “it is the domain of the States, and\nnot the federal courts, to conduct apportionment in the\nfirst  place.”  See  Voinovich,  507  U.S.  at  156.  Finally,\nonly “[i]f a State has good reason to think that all the\n‘Gingles preconditions’ are met, then so too it has good\nreason to believe that §2 requires drawing a majority-\nminority district.” Cooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1470 (emphasis\nadded) (citing Vera, 517 U.S. at 978 (1996)). The State\nhas  two  of  the  best  reasons  one  can  imagine  for\nbelieving  that  Gingles  one  was  not  met  in  this  case:\n1) CD27 and 35 were adopted with the imprimatur of\nthe  District  Court,  and  2)  it  is  not  possible  to\ndemonstrate  an  additional  Hispanic  opportunity\ndistrict is required or even possible in Texas. J.S. App.\n112a  (“The  [District]  Court  found  that  seven  Latino\nopportunity  districts  were  required.  .  .  .”);  J.S.  App.\na127 (“The Supreme Court ruled that a nearly identical\ndistrict [to those the Plaintiffs’ proposed] in the same\nlocation  was  ‘noncompact  for  §2  purposes.’”)  (citing\nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 435. Therefore, the District Court\nerred in finding CD27 impermissibly diluted minority\nvoting strength, and this Court should note jurisdiction\nor  summarily  reverse  to  correct  the  District  Court’s\nerror. \n\n\f23\n\nCONCLUSION\n\nThe United States District Court’s decision below to\noverturn its own map, drawn for the express purpose of\ncomplying  with  the  Constitution  and  the  VRA,  is  as\nerroneous  as  it  is  egregious.  In  the  absence  of\nintervening  precedent  by  this  Court  that  would\nabrogate  its  Order  Adopting  Plan  C235,  the  District\nCourt simply cannot issue an order, cause States and\nvoters to act in reliance on that order, and then simply\nchange  its  mind  on  the  eve  of  a  deadline  to  redraw\ndistrict  maps  for  the  2018  elections.  Moreover,  the\nDistrict Court’s arbitrary and suspicious approach to\nthe Legislature’s action stands in blatant disregard to\nthe deference afforded to states on this fundamental\nquestion of state sovereignty. Accordingly, amici curiae\nrespectfully  urge  this  Court  to  note  probable\njurisdiction or summarily reverse the District Court’s\ndecision.\n\nRespectfully submitted,\n\nJeff Landry\n  Attorney General\n\nElizabeth B.
