        "Plaintiffs’  briefs  are  a  study  in  revisionist  history. \nUnable to explain how the Texas Legislature could have \nengaged in intentional racial discrimination by adopting \nmaps imposed by the district court itself, plaintiffs insist \nthat  the  actions  of  the  2013  Legislature  are  essentially \nirrelevant.  They  even  characterize  the  2013  Legisla-\nture’s enactment of the court-ordered plans as “legisla-\ntive inaction.” That is nonsensical. The districts plaintiffs \nchallenge are districts duly enacted by the 2013 Legisla-\nture. The intentions this Court must examine are there-\nfore the intentions of the 2013 Legislature. And plaintiffs \ncannot blind the Court to the reality that the 2013 Leg-\nislature enacted the 2013 maps only after those maps re-\nceived  the  imprimatur  of  a  federal  three-judge  district \ncourt.  \n\nPlaintiffs protest that the district court did not draw \nthe challenged districts in the first instance, and that its \n2012 decisions imposing the interim maps were “prelim-\ninary.”  But  that  misses  the  point.  Except  for  HD90, \nevery district invalidated below was subject to pending \nclaims in 2012. The district court was operating under a \nmandate to review those claims and impose maps “that \ndo not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.” \nPerry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 396 (2012) (per curiam). And \nthe  district  court  assured  the  parties  that  it  “obey[ed] \n[this] Court’s directive” and remedied all “plausible legal \ndefects” identified by plaintiffs’ claims against the 2011 \nmaps—as  the  district  court  was  required  to  do  for  all \nclaims  that  were  merely  “not  insubstantial”  under  the \nlower  VRA  §5  standard  set  forth  in  this  Court’s  Perry \ndecision. H.J.S. App. 313a; accord C.J.S. App. 408a.  \n\n(1)",
        "2 \n\nAccordingly,  even  accepting  the  fundamentally \nflawed notion that the 2013 Legislature was under some \nobligation to “remove” any “taint” of intentional discrim-\nination  from  the  court-ordered  maps,  the  district  court \nitself  had  already  concluded  that  no  such  taint  existed. \nThe  Legislature  cannot  plausibly  be  said  to  have  en-\ngaged in intentional discrimination by taking the district \ncourt  at  its  word—particularly  given  the  strong  “pre-\nsumption  of  good  faith”  to  which  the  Legislature’s  ac-\ntions  were  entitled  and  the  “extraordinary  caution” \ncourts  must  apply  when  confronting  claims  alleging  an \nunlawful legislative purpose. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. \n900, 916 (1995).  \n\nThat is all the more true given the context in which \nthe  district  court’s  assurances  came.  By  the  time  the \ncourt  imposed  its  remedial  maps  in  2012,  there  had  al-\nready been: (1) a two-week trial and multiple rounds of \npost-trial  briefs  in  2011,  culminating  in  the  first  set  of \ncourt-ordered remedial maps; (2) an appeal resulting in \nthis  Court’s  Perry  opinion  vacating  those  maps;  and \n(3) post-remand  hearings  and  additional  briefing  on \npending claims—including briefing on claims in the par-\nallel §5 proceedings before the D.C. district court.  \n\nIf the district court truly believed that it lacked suffi-\ncient time to adequately address plaintiffs’ claims before \nissuing  remedial  maps,  it  would  have  revisited  those \nclaims immediately after the 2012 elections. And if it be-\nlieved  the  remedial  maps  incorporated  any  discrimina-\ntory “taint” that should have been apparent to the Leg-\nislature  when  it  adopted  the  court-ordered  districts  in \n2013, the district court could not have denied two motions",
        "3 \n\nto  enjoin  the  Legislature’s  2013  plans,  leaving  them  in \nplace for four years and two election cycles while it adju-\ndicated  moot  claims  against  the  repealed  2011  plans. \nThose are hardly the actions of a court concerned that it \nmay have violated this Court’s mandate to impose maps \n“that do not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights \nAct.” Perry, 565 U.S. at 396. \n\nRather than point to any evidence that the Legisla-\nture  enacted  the  court-imposed  plans  for  a  discrimina-\ntory  purpose  (because  there  is  none),  plaintiffs  accuse \nthe  2013  Legislature  of  having  “rushed”  the  plans \nthrough.  That  is  manifestly  wrong:  The  Legislature  in \nfact heard nearly 33 hours of debate over 11 public hear-\nings,  after  which  it  held  floor  debates  spanning  over \n1,000 pages in the House and Senate journals. But it is \nalso beside the point. Plaintiffs’ burden was to prove that \nthe Legislature enacted those plans in a deliberate effort \nto sort voters on the basis of race or adversely affect mi-\nnority  voters.  Even  assuming  (contrary  to  reality)  that \nthe  Legislature  had  “rushed”  the  maps  through,  that \nwould  not  begin  to  prove  that  the  Legislature  enacted \ncourt-imposed remedial districts for an illicit purpose.  \n\nMoreover, plaintiffs do not dispute that it is not pos-\nsible  to  draw  additional  performing  majority-minority \ndistricts, as defined in Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, \n15  (2009)  (plurality  op.),  in  either  the  congressional  or \nstate-house plans—even though nine groups of plaintiffs \nand multiple experts spent more than six years trying to \ndo so. That shows that plaintiffs’ case is not about legal \ndefects in the State’s maps or the makeup of the State’s",
        "4 \n\nlegislative delegations; it is about plaintiffs’ desire to re-\nimpose preclearance on the State of Texas after Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). \n\nIn the end, then, plaintiffs are forced to spend most \nof  their  time  complaining  about  the  motivations  of  the \n2011  Legislature.  Those  complaints  are  unfounded,  as \nthe district court correctly concluded in 2012 and Judge \nSmith’s dissent rightly recognized in 2017. But they are \nultimately irrelevant, as this case is about the actions of \nthe 2013 Legislature, and plaintiffs did not come close to \nmeeting their burden of proving an unlawful purpose—\nwith or without the strong presumption of good faith to \nwhich those actions are entitled.  \n\nI.  This  Court  Has  Jurisdiction  To  Review  The  Dis-\n\ntrict Court’s Orders.  \n\nThe  three-judge  district  court  issued  orders  on  the \neve of election deadlines that had the practical effect of \nblocking  the  State  from  using  its  existing  redistricting \nplans for the 2018 elections. The orders did much more \nthan merely invalidate districts in Plans C235 and H358. \nThe  court  concluded  that  these  purported  violations \n“now  require  a  remedy”  and “must  be  remedied  either \nby  the  Texas  Legislature  or  this  Court.”  C.J.S.  App. \n118a-119a; see H.J.S. App. 84a, 86a. And it gave the Gov-\nernor just three days to call a special session or, failing \nthat, ordered defendants to participate in expedited ju-\ndicial redistricting. There can be no serious dispute that \nif the State had responded by declining to redistrict and \nnotifying  the  court  that  it  would  still  use  the  existing \nplans in the 2018 elections, defendants would have been \nheld in contempt. Tellingly, plaintiffs do not even try to",
        "5 \n\nclaim  there  was  any  prospect  that  the  State  could  still \nuse  Plans  C235  or  H358  in  the  2018  elections.  That \nshould  be  the  end  of  the  matter,  as  it  is  plain  that  the \ndistrict court prohibited the State from using its maps in \nfurther elections. \n\nPlaintiffs nonetheless insist that this Court lacks ju-\nrisdiction under the “plain language” of 28 U.S.C. §1253 \nbecause the district court did not label its order an “in-\njunction.”  H.Br.29.1  In  other  words,  they  insist  that \n§1253 imposes a magic-words test. That is the only way \nto understand their contention (H.Br.29, 30-31) that this \nCourt lacks jurisdiction here despite having jurisdiction \nin  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S. Ct.  1455  (2017),  and  Gill  v. \nWhitford,  No.  16-1161  (U.S.)—cases  where  district \ncourts also invalidated districts and ordered the States \nto  pass  new  plans,  but  had  not  yet  imposed  remedial \nplans  when  the  States  appealed. But this Court has al-\nready rejected a magic-words test in Carson v. Ameri-\ncan  Brands,  Inc.,  holding  that  appellate  jurisdiction \nturns on the “practical effect” of a court’s order—not its \nlabel or its precise “terms.” 450 U.S. 79, 83-84 (1981).  \n\nPlaintiffs try to limit Carson to 28 U.S.C. §1292(a)(1) \nappeals,  H.Br.30,  but  nothing  in  the  text  of  28  U.S.C. \n§§1253 or 1292 could justify a functional approach for one \nand a magic-words test for the other. Section 1292(a)(1) \n\n1  The  abbreviation  “Br.”  refers  to  the  Brief  for  Appellants; \n“U.S.Br.” refers to the Brief for the United States as Appellee \nin  Support  of  Appellants;  “C.Br.”  refers  to  the  Brief  for  Ap-\npellees  (Congressional  Districts);  and  “H.Br.”  refers  to  the \nBrief for Appellees Other than the United States (State House \nDistricts).",
        "6 \n\nvests  courts  with  jurisdiction  over  “[i]nterlocutory  or-\nders  . . .  granting  . . .  injunctions,”  and  §1253  vests  this \nCourt with jurisdiction over “an order granting . . . an in-\nterlocutory . . . injunction.” The fact that §1292(a)(1) does \nnot apply “where a direct review may be had in the Su-\npreme Court” is relevant only to determining the source \nof  this  Court’s  jurisdiction—not  to  determining  what \nqualifies as an “injunction.” Nor does it make any differ-\nence  that  §1253  is  interpreted  narrowly.  H.Br.29-30. \nCarson  acknowledged  that  §1292  is  interpreted  “nar-\nrowly” too, yet that did not stop the Court from holding \nthat  an  order  is  appealable  under  §1292  if  it  has  the \n“practical effect” of an injunction. 450 U.S. at 84.  \n\nThis Court’s decision in Gunn v. University Commit-\nted  to  End  the  War  in  Viet  Nam,  399  U.S.  383  (1970), \ndoes not help plaintiffs either. In Gunn, the district court \nstayed its order finding a First Amendment overbreadth \nviolation, then “entered no further order of any kind.” Id. \nat 387. Moreover, the initial order was wholly unclear as \nto what “was to be enjoined” and “against whom” any or-\nder would run, leading appellants themselves to concede \nthat it was really an “advisory opinion.” Id. at 388, 389. \nHere, by contrast, there is no doubt about the who, what, \nor  when:  The  district  court  ordered  the  State  immedi-\nately to engage in expedited redistricting, and expressly \nrefused  to  stay  its  order  “pending  the  next  session”  of \nthe  Texas  Legislature,  as  the  court  in Gunn  had  done.",
        "7 \n\nId. at 386. The district court thus placed the State in pre-\ncisely the same situation as the States in Gill and Cooper, \nwhere this Court exercised appellate jurisdiction.2  \n\nPlaintiffs assert that the State’s position “transforms \nevery declaration of a violation into a de facto injunction.” \nH.Br.33. Far from it. Declaratory relief, by itself, is in-\nsufficient  to  invoke  this  Court’s  appellate  jurisdiction. \nMitchell v. Donovan, 398 U.S. 427, 430-31 (1970) (per cu-\nriam). But where an order goes beyond declaring rights \nand compels the State to engage in immediate redistrict-\ning on the eve of election deadlines, there is no escaping \nthe conclusion that the State has been enjoined from us-\ning its existing map. This Court’s jurisdiction is just as \nclear here as it was in Cooper and Gill. \n\nII.  The  Legislature  Did  Not  Engage  In  Intentional \nDiscrimination  When  It  Enacted  Districts  Im-\nposed By The District Court Itself. \n\nThe district court reached the remarkable conclusion \nthat  the  Texas  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional  dis-\ncrimination when it adopted as its own the same districts \nthat the court itself ordered the State to use in the 2012 \nelections. Try as they do, plaintiffs cannot justify that un-\nprecedented and untenable result. Plaintiffs attempt to \nrecharacterize  the  district  court’s  decision  as  resting \nsolely on factual findings about the Legislature’s intent, \n\n2  Whitcomb  v.  Chavis,  403  U.S.  914  (1971),  is  also  consistent \nwith  exercising  jurisdiction,  as  it  was  an  unexplained  order \ndismissing for lack of jurisdiction where expedited redistrict-\ning had not been ordered. See U.S.Br.23.",
        "8 \n\nin hopes of cloaking it in clear-error review. But the dis-\ntrict court did not make any finding that the Legislature \nacted with improper intent in 2013—because the court’s \nfatally  flawed  “remove  the  taint”  theory  obviated  the \nneed to do so. Nor could the court have made any such \nfinding, as plaintiffs’ paltry evidence does not come close \nto establishing intentional discrimination, let alone over-\ncoming  the  strong  presumption  that  the  Legislature’s \ndecision to enact the court’s own maps was a good-faith \neffort to comply with the Constitution and the VRA and \nbring this already-protracted litigation to an end.  \n\nA.  The  District  Court’s  Intentional  Discrimina-\ntion Analysis Rests on a Fatally Flawed Legal \nStandard. \n\nPlaintiffs’ efforts to defend the district court’s inten-\ntional-discrimination holding as a factual finding entitled \nto clear-error review, H.Br.41-43; C.Br.1, 40, fail at the \nthreshold.  The  district  court  never  found  that  the  2013 \nLegislature enacted Plan C235 or H358 for an unconsti-\ntutional  purpose—that  is,  in  a  deliberate  effort  to  sort \nvoters on the basis of race, Miller, 515 U.S. at 916-17, or \n“‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects \nupon  an  identifiable  group,”  Pers.  Adm’r  of  Mass.  v. \nFeeney,  442  U.S.  256,  279  (1979).  Instead,  the  court \nfaulted the State for failing to prove that the Legislature \n“remove[d]”  the  purported  “discriminatory  taint”  from \nthe court-imposed plans before adopting them as its own. \nC.J.S. App. 46a. \n\nThat reasoning is wrong at every turn. First, it evis-\ncerates  both  the  strong  “presumption  of  good  faith”  to",
        "9 \n\nwhich  legislative  enactments  are  entitled  and  the  “ex-\ntraordinary caution” courts must employ when confront-\ning unlawful-purpose claims. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. If \nanything, the “normal presumption of good faith” should \nhave been “heightened by the State’s acceptance of the \njudicial plan.” U.S.Br.30. Instead, the district court not \nonly ignored the presumption, but reversed it, demand-\ning  that  defendants  prove  that  the  maps  were  not \n“tainted” with “discriminatory intent.” \n\nFor the most part, plaintiffs ignore the presumption \nof good faith as well. One of their briefs never even men-\ntions it, while the other contends that it does not apply \nbecause the districts imposed by the court in 2012 were \n“entirely a product of lines drawn by the Legislature” in \n2011. H.Br.36-37. That is wrong as a factual matter, infra \npp.12-14, but it is also beside the point. While the United \nStates is undoubtedly correct that the presumption ap-\nplies with particular force given that the Legislature en-\nacted court-imposed maps, the presumption is fully ap-\nplicable  even  on  the  assumption  that  those  maps  were \n“legislatively drawn.” H.Br.27. After all, the whole point \nof the presumption is to give the benefit of the doubt to \n“legislative enactments,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, which \nthe  2013  maps  undoubtedly  were.  The  presumption  of \ngood faith did not disappear just because an earlier leg-\nislature  enacted  different  maps  with  purportedly  dis-\ncriminatory intent.  \n\nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), does not \nsuggest otherwise. “Hunter did not involve a subsequent \nlegislative enactment at all,” U.S.Br.33, let alone a sub-\nsequent legislative enactment codifying a judicial order.",
        "10 \n\nThere, the legislature merely sat on its hands while the \ncourts  struck  down  various  provisions  of  a  law  admit-\ntedly  passed  with  discriminatory  intent,  U.S.Br.30-31, \nand this Court expressly reserved judgment on whether \nthe  same  law  “would  be  valid  if  enacted  today  without \nany  impermissible  motivation.”  471  U.S.  at  233.  Here, \nthe  Texas  Legislature  adopted  different  plans  that  the \ndistrict  court  concluded  remedied  any  “plausible”  legal \ndefects in the 2011 plans. H.J.S. App. 313a.  \n\nRelying on Justice Thomas’s concurrence in United \nStates v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 746-47 (1992), plaintiffs \nalso  suggest  that  the  presumption  is  not  warranted \nwhere  there  is  a  history  of  discrimination.  H.Br.46-47. \nBut Fordice involved policies continued from a “de jure \nsystem”  of  racial  segregation  in  public  schools—and \neven then, the Court still required ongoing “discrimina-\ntory effects” to prove liability. 505 U.S. at 745 (Thomas, \nJ., concurring) (quoting id. at 729 (majority op.)). As Jus-\ntice Thomas’s concurrence made clear, the Court consid-\nered “the historical background of the policy, the degree \nof its adverse impact, and the plausibility of any justifi-\ncation asserted in its defense,” but it did “not formulate \n[its] standard in terms of a burden shift with respect to \nintent.” Id. at 747. \n\nOf course, the bare act of reenactment cannot “save” \notherwise  invalid  legislation  “from  invalidity,”  C.Br.31 \nn.17, or “insulate” districts “from further challenge, re-\ngardless  of  their  legal  infirmities,”  H.Br.20.  Reenact-\nment has no bearing on claims of discriminatory effects, \nand  it  does  not  definitively  answer  the  question  of  dis-",
        "11 \n\ncriminatory intent. Reenactment does, however, funda-\nmentally alter the object of the intent analysis, which is \nthe intent of the legislature that enacted the challenged \nlaw. And while a court need not blind itself to the history \nbehind  a  law’s  enactment  in  assessing  that  intent,  the \nnew  legislation  does  not  lose  its  presumption  of  good \nfaith  just  because  a  previous  legislature  enacted  the \nsame law with an allegedly illicit purpose. See U.S.Br.28-\n30.  \n\nRegardless,  whatever  questions  may  arise  when  a \nlegislature enacts the same law but “manufacture[s] new \nlegislative records,” C.Br.28, that is manifestly not what \nhappened here. Far from reenacting the 2011 maps, the \n2013 Legislature repealed them and replaced them with \nmaps imposed by the district court itself, which changed \n9 congressional and 28 state-house districts. To be sure, \nthose maps retained some aspects of the 2011 plans, but \nit is neither unusual nor legally suspect for a new law to \nretain aspects of its predecessor, and that certainly does \nnot convert separate districting legislation into “legisla-\ntive  inaction.”  C.Br.27-28.  Accordingly,  the  2013  plans \nwere entitled to the same presumption of good faith as \nany other districting plans, and could be invalidated only \nif plaintiffs satisfied their heavy burden of proving that \nthe legislature enacted the court-imposed maps in a de-\nliberate effort to sort voters on the basis of race, Miller, \n515 U.S. at 916, or “because of” some unlawful “adverse \neffects”  on  minority  voters,  Feeney,  442  U.S.  at  279.",
        "12 \n\nPlaintiffs cannot short-circuit that analysis by complain-\ning about the motivations of a different legislature in en-\nacting a different law.3 \n\nB.  There Is No Evidence that the 2013 Legislature \n\nEngaged in Intentional Discrimination.  \n\nUnable to defend the district court’s legal reasoning, \nplaintiffs resort to distorting the record. But their efforts \ndo not bring them any closer to meeting their heavy bur-\nden  of  proving  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  inten-\ntional discrimination.  \n\n1. Plaintiffs first try to avoid the presumption of good \nfaith by insisting that the court-imposed plans were not \nreally “the court’s” because they retained some districts \nfrom the 2011 plans. H.Br.36 (emphasis added). That ar-\ngument misses the point. Defendants have never claimed \nthat  everything  in  the  court-ordered  maps  was  “the \ncourt’s idea.” H.Br.37. There is no dispute that the court \nretained some districts from the 2011 maps. But that is \nnot an accident, or the product of some hoodwinking by \ndefendants.  It  is  a  direct  and  intended  consequence  of \nthis  Court’s  decision  in  Perry,  which  specifically  in-\nstructed the district court to “take care not to incorpo-\nrate into the interim plan any legal defects in the state \nplan,” but to preserve districts that were not subject to \n“not insubstantial” §5 claims or to constitutional or VRA \n\n3  Indeed,  plaintiffs  previously  insisted  on  separate  trials  for \nthe 2011 and 2013 plans because “the state actors responsible \nfor  creating  the  2011  and  2013  redistricting  plans  are  differ-\nent.”  Plaintiffs’  Advisory  in  Support  of  Proposed  Scheduling \nOrder at 4 (Oct. 9, 2013), ECF No. 921.",
        "13 \n\n§2 challenges that were “likely to succeed on the merits.” \n565 U.S. at 394.  \n\nAnd  that  is  precisely  what  the  district  court  did.  It \nordered the State to use the 2012 maps only after care-\nfully reviewing all pending claims against the 2011 maps \nand  concluding  that  every  “plausible”  legal  defect  had \nbeen  remedied.  H.J.S.  App.  313a.  Plaintiffs  claim  that \nthe  Legislature  was  not  entitled  to  rely  on  the  district \nthey  were  “preliminary.” \ncourt’s  orders  because \nH.Br.37. But the district court assured the parties that it \n“obey[ed]  [this]  Court’s  directive  by  adhering  to  the \nState’s enacted plan except in the discrete areas in which \nwe have preliminarily found plausible legal defects under \nthe  standards  of  review  the  Court  has  announced.” \nH.J.S.  App.  313a.  Preliminary  or  not,  the  Legislature \nwas  certainly  entitled  to  take  the  district  court  at  its \nword that it had complied with this Court’s mandate “to \ndraw  interim  maps  that  do  not violate the Constitution \nor the Voting Rights Act.” Perry, 565 U.S. at 396.  \n\nPlaintiffs’ claim that the district court’s 2012 orders \n“did nothing more than decline to enter a preliminary in-\njunction” against the unprecleared 2011 plans is demon-\nstrably false. H.Br.28. The district court had already en-\ntered  a  preliminary  injunction  against  those  plans  in \n2011. J.A. 17a. In 2012, the court affirmatively ordered \nthe State to conduct its upcoming elections under plans \nthat  had  been  reviewed,  approved,  and  substantially \nmodified, with changes to 9 congressional and 28 state-\nhouse districts. C.J.S. App. 423a (“This Court has inde-\npendently  reviewed  Plan  C235 . . . .”);  H.J.S.  App.  315a \n(referring  to  “this  Court’s  independently  drawn  Plan",
        "14 \n\nH309”).  The  court  did  so,  moreover,  after  having  con-\nducted two weeks of trial, held several days of hearings, \nand received hundreds of pages of briefing on plaintiffs’ \nclaims—including  additional  briefing  and  hearings  fol-\nlowing  this  Court’s  remand.  J.A.  4a-20a;  C.J.S.  App. \n380a. That is a world apart from cases where parties “re-\nlied on a short stipulation of facts” and underdeveloped \nlegal theories, Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, \n398  (1981),  and  where  the  district  court  was  “discon-\ncerted by the hurried character of the proceeding” that \noccurred the day after the preliminary injunction motion \nwas filed, Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 79 (2007). \n\nIn  short,  the  notion  that  the  district  court  in  2012 \n“simply  ‘defer[red]’”  to  the  preferences  of  the  Legisla-\nture,  H.Br.19,  strains  credulity.  The  court  imposed  the \n2012  maps  only  after  careful  consideration  of  the  very \nsame challenges pressed here, and with the express as-\nsurance that they addressed all “plausible legal defects” \nin the 2011 plans. H.J.S. App. 313a. The Legislature did \nnot  engage  in  intentional  discrimination  by  taking  the \ndistrict court at its word. \n\n2. Plaintiffs next insist that “the Legislature did not \nactually believe that ‘passing the interim maps would end \nthe litigation.’” H.Br.43. If they mean that the Legisla-\nture knew plaintiffs would continue to fight them no mat-\nter what maps they passed, then they are certainly cor-\nrect.  The  Legislature  did,  however,  have  an  eminently \ngood-faith basis to believe that the district court would \nnot invalidate the maps that it had just ordered the State \nto  use.  Plaintiffs  cite  no  evidence  for  their  charge  that \nthe 2013 Legislature enacted districts because they were",
        "15 \n\nallegedly  “drawn  in  2011  for  discriminatory  reasons.” \nH.Br.45.4 And there is nothing remotely constitutionally \nsuspect about adopting new maps because they are more \nlikely than the previous maps to satisfy the Constitution \nand VRA. After all, it would be a strange doctrine indeed \nthat viewed with suspicion efforts by subsequent legisla-\ntures to remedy the perceived missteps of their prede-\ncessors.  \n\nPlaintiffs  protest  that  the  2013  redistricting  plans \nwere  adopted  too  “‘quickly,’  with  no  real  discussion  of \ndistrict  configurations.”  H.Br.43.  Nonsense.  The  redis-\ntricting legislation was under consideration for 22 days—\nalmost the entire 30-day special session. Br. Stat. App. \n34a, 36a; Tex. Const. art. III, §40. The House and Senate \ncommittees held more than 30 hours of public hearings \nin multiple cities, resulting in more than 1,300 transcript \npages. See 2017 JX-10-15, 20-24. And the separate floor \ndebate accounted for more than 1,000 pages in the Texas \nHouse and Senate Journals. See 2017 JX-17-18; 2017 JX-\n26-27. The Legislature adopted multiple amendments to \nPlan  H309,  and  it  considered  several  amendments  to \nPlan  C235,  most  of  which  were  rejected  on  bipartisan \nvotes  in  the  Senate  Redistricting  Committee.  See  2017 \nJX-24.4.  \n\nPlaintiffs charge the Legislature with “[w]illfully ig-\nnor[ing] those who pointed out deficiencies” in the court-\nordered plans. C.Br.21 (citing C.J.S. App. 45a n.45). But \n\n4 As for supposed “self-contradictory statements” by “legisla-\ntive  leaders,”  H.Br.43,  the  cited  footnote  (H.J.S.  App.  358a \nn.45) does not identify any such statement.",
        "16 \n\nneither the district court nor plaintiffs identified a single \n“deficiency”  that  was  “pointed  out”  to  the  Legislature \nbut ignored.5 Jeff Archer, an attorney at the Texas Leg-\nislative Council, did not identify any “deficiency” in the \ncourt-ordered  plans.  Instead,  his  cited  testimony  con-\nsists  only  of  general  statements  about  the  procedural \nposture \nissued.  See \nU.S.Br.42.  Notably,  Archer  specifically  declined  to  dis-\ncuss  the  “validity”  or  “legal  ramifications”  of  any  pro-\nposed alternative plan. See 2017 JX-14.4 at 7. Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel  MALDEF,  by  contrast,  informed  the  Legisla-\nture  that  these  remedial  plans  addressed  every  defect \nidentified by the D.C. district court under VRA §5. C.J.S. \nApp. 436a-439a. \n\nin  which  those  orders  were \n\nPlaintiffs also argue that the “legislative findings re-\ngarding  the  2013  [state-house]  plan  were  in  fact  pro-\nduced  ahead  of  time  by  the  Texas  Attorney  General.” \nH.Br.43. But the Attorney General’s advice to the Legis-\nlature to make its legislative findings part of the statu-\ntory text says nothing about the Legislature’s purpose. \nAnd there is no evidence that the Legislature did not be-\nlieve those findings—let alone that it did not believe the \n\n5  Nor  was  there  any  “‘steadfast  refusal’  to  consider  creating \nadditional minority opportunity districts.” H.Br.20. Plaintiffs \nare really complaining about the Legislature’s decision not to \ncreate  additional  crossover  or  coalition  districts,  which,  as \nplaintiffs’  congressional  brief  concedes  (C.Br.4  n.2),  are  not \nthe same thing as “minority opportunity districts.” The failure \nto adopt crossover or coalition districts cannot support a find-\ning  of  intentional  discrimination,  as  VRA  §2  does  not  require \neither one. See Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 15.",
        "17 \n\ndistrict  court’s  express  assurance  that  it  followed  this \nCourt’s  directives.  See  C.J.S.  App.  423a;  H.J.S.  App. \n313a. \n\nRather than engage the legislative history, plaintiffs \ndistort the timeline to create a false impression that the \n2013  Legislature  reenacted  districts  after  the  district \ncourt  had  already  found  them  “tainted”  by  intentional \ndiscrimination.  In  Bell  County,  for  example,  where  the \nLegislature  did  not  change  the  district  boundaries  in \n2013, plaintiffs assert that “[t]he court had earlier found \nthat  in  configuring  the  Bell  County  districts,  Repre-\nsentative  Aycock  had  deliberately  ‘divided  the  growing \nminority  City  of  Killeen  to  protect  his  incumbency.’” \nH.Br.22 (citing H.J.S. Supp. App. 289a). In fact, the dis-\ntrict  court  reached  that  conclusion  nearly  four  years \nlater, in its 2017 advisory opinion on the 2011 maps. The \n2013  Legislature  obviously  could  not  have  “intended  to \ncontinue  the  intentional  discrimination  found  in  Plan \nH283,”  H.Br.22  (quoting  H.J.S.  App.  22a),  when  there \nwas no such “finding” until 2017. \n\n3.  Finally,  plaintiffs’  post-hoc  efforts  to  undermine \nthe conclusions the district court reached in 2012 are en-\ntirely  unfounded,  and  provide  no  basis  to  question  the \nLegislature’s good faith in relying on the district court’s \nexpress assurance that it followed this Court’s mandate \nto impose maps that complied with the Constitution and \nthe VRA.  \n\nFirst,  plaintiffs’  allegation  that  the  court  was  not \naware in 2012 that “it was possible to draw two majority",
        "18 \n\nHCVAP districts” in Nueces County, H.Br.38, is irrele-\nvant. Mapdrawers relied on Spanish-surname-voter-reg-\nistration data when drawing House districts in 2011 be-\ncause citizen-voting-age-population data were not avail-\nable  until  late  April.  H.J.S. App.  129a.  There  is  no  evi-\ndence that they deliberately refused to consider HCVAP \ndata.  In  any  case,  Texas  Legislative  Council  attorneys \ncorrectly  advised  that  two  performing  Hispanic-oppor-\ntunity  districts  could  not  be  drawn  in  Nueces  County. \nH.J.S. Supp. App. 93a. The Legislature’s decision not to \ndivide Nueces County in a way that would have diluted \nHispanic  voting  strength  is  not  evidence  of  intentional \ndiscrimination.  \n\nSecond, Representative Aycock’s testimony at retrial \nin 2014, H.Br.38, does not support a conclusion of inten-\ntional  discrimination  or  racial  predominance  in  HD54. \nHe merely testified that he attempted to create a Repub-\nlican  district  by  adding  areas  that  supported  Republi-\ncans. Br.54-56. Drawing a Republican district is not ra-\ncial discrimination, “even if it so happens that the most \nloyal Democrats happen to be [minorities] and even if the \nState  were  conscious  of  that  fact.” Hunt  v.  Cromartie , \n526 U.S. 541, 551 (1999). In any event, the district court \ncorrectly rejected the only claims that plaintiffs actually \nbrought in Bell County. Infra pp.26-27.  \n\nThird, plaintiffs’ claim that the court had not “heard \nfrom the architect of the challenged districts in western \nDallas  County”  in  2012  is  simply  wrong.  H.Br.38.  That \nindividual (Ryan Downton) gave extensive live testimony",
        "19 \n\nin  2011,  see  2011  Tr.  903-1023,  which  the  district  court \ncited in its 2012 opinion. C.J.S. App. 411a, 414a, 422a. \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nAt bottom, neither the record nor common sense sup-\nports the district court’s implausible conclusion that the \nLegislature engaged in intentional discrimination when \nit embraced court-imposed districts as its own. Plaintiffs \ndo  not  even  try  to  explain  how  the  very  same  districts \ncould be lawful when imposed by the district court, but \n“tainted” with discriminatory intent when later enacted \nby the Legislature.  \n\nIII. There  Never  Was  Any  Vote  Dilution  Or  Racial \nGerrymandering  To  Begin  With  In  The  Districts \nImposed By The District Court In 2012. \n\nBy the time the district court held a second trial on \nclaims against the 2011 maps, those maps had been re-\npealed, rendering any dispute about the motivations un-\nderlying them moot—a proposition that plaintiffs barely \neven bother to contest. That said, the district court’s “re-\nmove  the  taint”  theory  fails  on  its  own  terms  because \nthere  never  was  any  “taint”  to  “remove”  in  the  first \nplace.6 \n\n6 To the extent the district court found intentional discrimina-\ntion based on one-person, one-vote violations (see Br.56-58, 62-\n63), plaintiffs have waived those arguments by choosing not to \ndefend them on appeal.",
        "20 \n\nA.  There  Was  No  Vote  Dilution  in  Districts  Im-\n\nposed by the District Court in 2012. \n\n1.  Intentional-vote-dilution  claims \n\nrequire \n\nproof of an actual vote-dilution effect. \n\nAt  the  outset,  all  of  the  district  court’s  intentional-\nvote-dilution findings were infected by its erroneous con-\nclusion that intention-vote-dilution claims do not require \nproof of vote dilution. Intentional-vote-dilution claims re-\nquire  proof  of  both  intent  to  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength and actual dilution of minority voting strength. \nSee, e.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (explain-\ning  that  districts  “violate  the  Fourteenth  Amendment \nwhen  they  are  adopted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose \nand  have  the  effect  of  diluting  minority  voting \nstrength”).  Those  requirements  do  not  change  just  be-\ncause  a  plaintiff  alleges  that  vote  dilution  was  “inten-\ntional.” \n\nPlaintiffs cannot escape that conclusion by asserting \na  constitutional  rather  than  a  VRA  claim,  because  the \nConstitution no more recognizes an intentional-vote-di-\nlution claim without vote dilution than the VRA does. To \nthe  contrary,  the  constitutional  test  for  vote  dilution  is \nmore demanding than the VRA test, as it requires both \ndiscriminatory  effects  and  discriminatory  intent.  See, \ne.g., City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 66-68 (1980) \n(plurality  op.).  As  Gingles  explained,  VRA  §2  “was  de-\nsigned  to  restore  the  ‘results  test’—the  legal  standard \nthat governed voting discrimination cases prior to [this \nCourt’s] decision in Mobile,” under which discriminatory \neffects alone were enough to establish a constitutional vi-\nolation. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 44 n.8 (1986).",
        "21 \n\nAccordingly, while the Constitution demands discrimina-\ntory intent and discriminatory effects after Mobile, VRA \n§2 now requires only the latter. But plaintiffs do not and \ncannot  cite  precedent  holding  that  the  Constitution  re-\nquires only the former.  \n\nInstead, plaintiffs rely principally on cases involving \nVRA §5. See H.Br.48.7 But those cases are readily distin-\nguishable, as that statute requires the State to prove that \nits voting laws do not have either a discriminatory pur-\npose  or  a  discriminatory  effect.  See  City  of  Pleasant \nGrove v. United States, 479 U.S. 462, 471 (1987); City of \nRichmond  v.  United  States,  422  U.S.  358,  378  (1975). \nThis Court has expressly refused, however, “to equate a \n§ 2 vote dilution inquiry with the § 5 retrogression stand-\nard.” Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 478 (2003). And \nit has certainly never equated the §5 standard with the \nEqual  Protection  Clause,  which  requires  plaintiffs  to \nprove both discriminatory intent and discriminatory ef-\nfects.  \n\nTo the extent cases suggest, in dicta, that a law with \na race-based purpose “has no legitimacy at all under our \nConstitution,” see Pleasant Grove, 479 U.S. at 471 n.11, \nthis  Court’s  modern  precedents  recognize  that  as  a  ra-\ncial-gerrymandering  claim.  For  example,  Garza  v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1990), cited \nin Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 20, was decided before this Court \nrecognized  racial-gerrymandering  claims  in  1993  in \n\n7  Plaintiffs  also  cite Rogers  v.  Lodge ,  458  U.S.  613  (1982), \nH.Br.48, but that case involved actual vote-dilution effect. See \n458 U.S. at 623-27.",
        "22 \n\nShaw,  509  U.S.  at  649.  Under  the  Court’s  current  doc-\ntrine, the appropriate claim in Garza would be racial ger-\nrymandering, because the county redistricted “with the \nintent to fragment the Hispanic population” among vari-\nous districts—even though no vote dilution actually oc-\ncurred. 918 F.2d at 770. \n\nTo establish an intentional-vote-dilution claim, then, \nplaintiffs  must  establish  both  that  the  Legislature  in-\ntended  to  dilute  minority  voting  strength  and  that  the \nLegislature succeeded in doing so. And to establish the \nlatter, plaintiffs must prove that it was possible to draw \nan additional performing majority-minority district. See, \ne.g., Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 15; LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. \n399,  430  (2006).  As  plaintiffs’  congressional  brief  cor-\nrectly recognizes, “[a] minority opportunity district un-\nder §2 is one in which minority voters [1] comprise a ma-\njority of eligible voters and [2] have a reasonable oppor-\ntunity to elect candidates of their choice.” C.Br.4 n.2. Ac-\ncordingly,  plaintiffs  cannot  establish  vote  dilution  by \nfaulting the Legislature for declining to draw a coalition \ndistrict. But see H.Br.49 (alleging intentional vote dilu-\ntion in Bell County because the “legislature’s decision to \nsplit Killeen minimized the voting strength of a multi-mi-\nnority  coalition”).  This  Court  has  recognized  that  VRA \n§2 does not require States to draw coalition districts. See \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 398 (citing Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13-15). \nAnd  with  good  reason,  as  requiring  coalition  districts \nwould only inject further considerations of race into re-\ndistricting. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 21-22.",
        "23 \n\nPlaintiffs  nonetheless  persist  in  urging  a  much \nbroader conception of vote dilution, insisting that it ex-\nists  “whenever  the  challenged  district  makes  it  harder \nfor the minority community to participate effectively in \nthe political process.” H.Br.49. That attempt to replace \nthe long-settled definition of vote dilution with an unde-\nfined  “discernible  discriminatory  effect”  standard, \nH.Br.28, smacks of an effort to resuscitate the VRA §5 \nretrogression standard, which considers “the diminution \nof  a  minority  group’s  effective  exercise  of  the  electoral \nfranchise.” Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 479. But this Court has \nexpressly refused to export that standard to the VRA §2 \nor Equal Protection Clause contexts.  \n\nIn  sum,  a  challenged  apportionment  scheme  either \nresults in dilution of minority voting strength or it does \nnot. Alleging intentional vote dilution adds the element \nof  discriminatory  intent,  but  it  does  not  change  the  re-\nquirement to prove that vote dilution actually occurred. \nThe district court’s contrary belief fatally infected all of \nits intentional-vote-dilution findings on the 2013 plans. \n\n2.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \n\nin CD27. \n\nUnder a correct understanding of the law, plaintiffs \ndid  not  and  could  not  prove  intentional  vote  dilution  in \nCD27.8  The  district  court  sustained  plaintiffs’  claim  on \n\n8  The  district  court  “did not  base  its  holdings  . . .  on  a  §  2  ef-\nfects  claim”  in  CD27.  C.J.S.  App.  113a-114a;  id.  at  113a  n.85 \n(“If  . . .  there  was  no  evidence  of  improper  intent,  this  would \nbe a different case . . . .”). Regardless, there was no vote-dilu-\ntion effect in CD27. Br.48-51.",
        "24 \n\nthe  theory  that  intent  alone  was  enough.  C.J.S.  App. \n112a-114a & n.85; cf. U.S.Br.16-17. In fact, the court ex-\npressly  found  that  CD27  does  “not  diminish  Hispanic \nvoter opportunity for § 2 effects purposes” because “no \nadditional compact Latino opportunity district could be \ndrawn”  in  the  region—a  finding  plaintiffs  do  not  chal-\nlenge. C.J.S. App. 113a; see C.Br.51. That should be the \nend of the matter, as a vote-dilution claim cannot survive \nwithout  proof  of  vote  dilution.  See  supra  Part  III.A.1. \nPlaintiffs nonetheless argue that their §2 rights were vi-\nolated  because  certain  Hispanic  voters  in  CD27  could \nhave been included in an existing majority-minority dis-\ntrict  elsewhere  (CD34,  anchored  in  Cameron  County). \nBut that is not a viable theory of vote dilution under §2 \nor the Constitution (or even a §5 retrogression problem, \nas  the  D.C.  district  court  rightly  concluded,  Texas  v. \nUnited  States,  887  F. Supp. 2d  133,  153  (D.D.C.  2012), \nvacated, 133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013) (mem.)).  \n\nAt any rate, there was no intentional discrimination \nin CD27 to begin with. The 2011 Legislature’s decision to \nmove  Nueces  County  to  a  separate  district  from  Cam-\neron  County  had  nothing  to  do  with  Hispanic  voters  in \nNueces County or with Travis County or CD35. The de-\ncision  was  instead  made  at  the  request  of  citizens  and \nlegislators in both Nueces and Cameron Counties, Br.51-\n52—and  was  made  at  the  beginning  of  the  2011  redis-\ntricting  process,  before  the  Legislature  had  even  re-\nceived census data. Aug. 2014 Tr. 1761-62, 1772-73. Plain-\ntiffs refuse to respond to that evidence, C.Br.45, and they \ndo not identify any contrary evidence, or even any sup-\nposed  “inconsistencies”  in  the  record,  C.Br.47.  That  is",
        "25 \n\nbecause there simply is no evidence that the Legislature \nacted, in 2011 or 2013, for the purpose of discriminating \nagainst Hispanic citizens in Nueces County.  \n\nPurporting to rely on Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, plain-\ntiffs argue that discriminatory purpose can be inferred \nfrom  the  Legislature’s  mere  knowledge  that  its  redis-\ntricting  would  have  “adverse  consequences  . . .  on  an \nidentifiable group—here, minority voters.” C.Br.47 n.25. \nAs an initial matter, there were no unlawful adverse con-\nsequences  because  there  was  no  vote  dilution.  Regard-\nless,  that  radical  argument  conflicts  directly  with \nFeeney,  which  admonished  that  “‘[d]iscriminatory  pur-\npose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as \nawareness  of  consequences.”  Feeney,  442  U.S.  at  279. \nThis is especially true in the redistricting context, where \n“the legislature always is aware of race.” Bethune-Hill \nv.  Va.  State  Bd.  of  Elections,  137  S. Ct.  788,  797  (2017) \n(quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646). Thus, this Court cited \nFeeney  when  it  made  clear  that  partisan  redistricting \ndoes  not  become  racial  gerrymandering  “even  if  it  so \nhappens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be [mi-\nnorities]  and  even  if  the  State  were  conscious  of  that \nfact.” Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 551.  \n\nWith no other leg to stand on, plaintiffs contend that \nthis case “obvious[ly] parallels” LULAC, asserting that \nthe 2011 Legislature impermissibly “engineered a trade \nthat took §2 rights from those who have them to provide \na §2 remedy to those who do not.” C.Br.51-52. This the-\nory has no basis in evidence. The State has never argued \nthat  CD35  “offset”  CD27.  Cf.  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  429. \nRegardless,  the  Legislature  could  not  “take”  §2  rights",
        "26 \n\nfrom  Hispanic  voters  in  Nueces  County  because  those \nvoters do not have a VRA §2 right to be placed in a ma-\njority-minority  district,  as  it  is  impossible  to  draw  an-\nother  majority-minority  district  in  the  area.  See  C.J.S. \nApp.  114a,  127a-131a,  421a.  That  readily  distinguishes \nthis  case  from  LULAC,  where  the  State  could  have \ndrawn another majority-minority district in the relevant \narea,  but  opted  not  to  do  so.  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  429. \nAccordingly,  the  fact  that  CD35  is  a  majority-minority \ndistrict is simply irrelevant to plaintiffs’ unfounded chal-\nlenge to CD27. \n\n3.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \n\nin Bell County state-house districts. \n\nPlaintiffs  understandably  have  very  little  to  say \nabout the district court’s incoherent conclusion regard-\ning Bell County state-house districts. The district court \ncorrectly found no §2 results violation because it is un-\ndisputed that a “majority-minority CVAP” district can-\nnot be drawn in Bell County. H.J.S. App. 18a, 180a. And \nit correctly found that the 2011 Legislature’s “failure to \ncreate  the  proposed  [coalition]  districts  was  not  inten-\ntional vote dilution.” H.J.S. App. 18a.  \n\nDespite these findings, the district court perplexingly \nfound  “intentional  discrimination/vote  dilution.”  H.J.S. \nApp. 22a. It purported to base that finding on “evidence \nthat  mapdrawers  . . .  intentionally  racially  gerryman-\ndered the district.” H.J.S. App. 18a. But no plaintiff even \nasserted a racial-gerrymandering claim in Bell County, \nH.J.S. App. 192a-193a—and with good reason, as there \nis no evidence that race predominated in the creation of \nBell  County  state-house  districts.  Having  rejected",
        "27 \n\nclaims  of  intentional  vote  dilution  and  vote-dilution  ef-\nfect, and having recognized that plaintiffs did not bring \nracial-gerrymandering claims, the district court had no \nbasis to find any violation in Bell County. \n\n4.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \n\nin Dallas County state-house districts. \n\nPlaintiffs  do  not  dispute  plaintiff  MALC’s  expert’s \nconcession  that  it  was  not  possible  to  create  additional \ndistricts in Dallas County with an African-American or \nHispanic citizen-voting-age-population majority.9 Nor do \nthey dispute that the 2011 Legislature designed HD105 \nto  pair  two  Republican  incumbents.  The  district  court \ncorrectly rejected plaintiffs’ claims that the 2011 Legis-\nlature engaged in vote dilution by failing to create coali-\ntion  districts.  H.J.S.  App.  26a.  And  plaintiffs  did  not \nbring  racial-gerrymandering  claims  in  Dallas  County. \nH.J.S. App. 192a-193a. The district court thus had no ba-\nsis to hold that the 2011 Legislature, let alone the 2013 \nLegislature,  engaged  in  either  intentional  vote  dilution \nor racial gerrymandering.  \n\n9 Plaintiffs’ claim that under the 2011 plan, “Anglos controlled \nnearly 60% of Dallas County’s house seats with only one-third \nof  its  population,”  H.Br.12,  is  misleading  because  it  relies  on \ntotal  population  rather  than  voting-eligible  population.  The \ndistrict  court  recognized  that  of  approximately  900,000  His-\npanic residents of Dallas County, “only 256,195 were Hispanic \ncitizens of voting age.” H.J.S. App. 169a. Vote-dilution claims \nrequire  examination  of  voting-eligible  population.  See,  e.g., \nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 429.",
        "28 \n\n5.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \nin Nueces County state-house districts. \n\nNueces  County’s  state-house  plan  is  the  only  area \nwhere the district court sustained a VRA §2 vote-dilution \nresults claim in addition to an intent claim. But neither \nof those findings can withstand scrutiny, as plaintiffs do \nnot and cannot contend that the Legislature could have \ndrawn  two  performing  majority-Hispanic  districts  in \nNueces County.10 In fact, the district court expressly de-\nclined to hold that VRA §2  required the Legislature to \ndraw two majority-minority districts in Nueces County. \nH.J.S. App. 60a. That is fatal to plaintiffs’ claims. \n\nNevertheless, the district court found both vote-dilu-\ntive intent and vote-dilutive effects on the basis that the \n2011  Legislature  failed  to  “explor[e]  whether  two \nHCVAP-majority districts wholly within Nueces County \nshould  be  drawn.”  H.J.S.  App.  59a.  But  any  additional \n“exploration”  would  have  been  futile  because  two  per-\nforming majority-Hispanic districts could not be drawn. \nPlaintiff  MALC’s  own  expert  concluded  that  drawing \ntwo  Hispanic-CVAP-majority  districts  wholly  within \nNueces County would result in “a lack of real electoral \nopportunity in both districts.” H.J.S. App. 44a (emphasis \nadded). The Legislature’s choice to avoid that pitfall was \nneither intentional nor actual vote dilution. \n\n10  Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  the  district  court’s  holding  that \nVRA  §2  did  not  require  the  State  to  break  its  whole-county \nrule. See Br.66 (citing H.J.S. App. 49a-50a, 59a).",
        "29 \n\nB.  There Was No Racial Gerrymandering in CD35. \nPlaintiffs do not deny that CD35 was drawn as one of \nseven  majority-Hispanic  districts  in  the  region,  or  that \nthe  Legislature  was  required  to  draw  seven  such  dis-\ntricts in 2011.11 Nor do plaintiffs argue that the Gingles \npreconditions, including racial bloc voting, are not satis-\nfied in CD35 as a whole. See U.S.Br.48. That should lay \nto rest any doubts about whether the Legislature had the \nrequisite “good reasons” to make it a majority-minority \ndistrict.  \n\nPlaintiffs  nonetheless  claim  (C.Br.38-39)  that  CD35 \nwas a racial gerrymander because racial bloc voting does \nnot  exist  in  Travis  County—which  comprises  only  a \nsmall fraction of the population and area of CD35.12 See \nU.S.Br.48.  Plaintiffs  fundamentally  misunderstand  the \nGingles inquiry. As this Court explained just last Term, \n“[t]he ultimate object of the inquiry” is the “district as a \nwhole.” Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 800. Indeed, it must \nbe, because the question under the third Gingles condi-\ntion is whether “racially polarized voting prevents” a mi-\nnority  group  from  electing  its  candidate  of  choice. \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1470 (quoting Growe v. Emison, 507 \nU.S. 25, 40 (1993)).  \n\nCooper  v.  Harris  does  not  support  plaintiffs’  argu-\nment (C.Br.43) that the absence of racial bloc voting in a \n\n11  The  relevant  region  is  South,  Central,  and  West  Texas. \nC.J.S. App. 423a. Plaintiffs’ term “the envelope,” C.Br.4, was \nconcocted  in  litigation  to  establish  a  fictitious  geographic \nboundary. \n\n12  Travis  County  accounts  for  only  21%  of  CD35’s  population. \nC.J.S. App. 181a.",
        "30 \n\nportion of a district defeats the third Gingles condition. \nCooper held that the State lacked good reasons to believe \nthat VRA §2 required it to add additional minority voters \nto an existing district that consistently elected minority-\npreferred  candidates.  137  S.  Ct.  at  1465-66.  Cooper did \nnot hold that VRA §2 cannot justify a new district, like \nCD35, merely because racial bloc voting may not exist in \na portion too small to control outcomes in the district as \na whole. \n\nPlaintiffs  rely  on  Shaw  v.  Hunt,  517  U.S.  899,  916 \n(1996), to argue that the Legislature did not have license \nto  draw  a  majority-minority  district  “anywhere”—by \nwhich  they  mean  to  draw  a  majority-minority  district \nthat  included  Travis  County.  C.Br.42.  But  the  Legisla-\nture  could  lawfully  draw  the  district  anywhere  it  had \ngood  reason  to  believe  all  three  Gingles  factors  were \nmet.  Cf.  Shaw,  517  U.S.  at  916  (racial  classification  did \nnot remedy VRA violation because district did not meet \nfirst Gingles requirement). And that is exactly what the \nLegislature did when it created CD35.  \n\nIn all events, the VRA-compliance defense to a racial-\ngerrymandering claim does not require a “perfect” VRA \nanalysis  ahead  of  time.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1464.  Ra-\nther, so long as the Legislature had “good reason” to be-\nlieve the district would remedy a potential VRA §2 prob-\nlem  (even  if  it  turns  out  that  the  VRA  did  not  actually \nrequire the district), then the district is not a racial ger-\nrymander.  Id.  at  1470.  Here,  plaintiff’s  counsel  MAL-\nDEF  proposed  CD35’s  Austin-to-San-Antonio  configu-\nration,  C.J.S.  App.  411a;  and  the  Latino  Task  Force \nplaintiffs  supported  CD35,  C.J.S.  App.  174a.  These  are",
        "31 \n\nabout the best reasons possible to believe that CD35 was \nneeded to satisfy VRA §2. \n\nPlaintiffs’ real complaint is not that the Legislature \nincluded part of Travis County in CD35, but that it elim-\ninated  an  Anglo-majority  crossover  district  previously \nbased  in  Travis  County.  But  the  district  court  did  not \nfind a violation on this basis, Br.47 n.12, because it cor-\nrectly  recognized  that  §2  does  not  require  the  State  to \npreserve  crossover  districts.  C.J.S.  App.  409a  (citing \nBartlett, 556 U.S. at 23). Plaintiffs racial-gerrymander-\ning claim is just another attempted end-run around Bart-\nlett.  \n\nIV. There Was No Racial Gerrymandering In HD90. \n\nFinally, the 2013 Legislature did not engage in racial \ngerrymandering when it modified HD90 to accommodate \nrequests  from  two  different  groups  of  minority  voters. \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that HD90 was drawn as a ma-\njority-Hispanic district at plaintiffs’ request in 2011 and \nretained  by  the  district  court  in  2012. See H.J.S.  Supp. \nApp. 258a-259a. They do not suggest that this configura-\ntion was not required by VRA §2, nor do they attempt to \ndefend the district court’s patently incorrect holding that \nVRA compliance is just “a vague goal,” rather than a de-\nfense  to  a  racial-gerrymandering  claim.  And  the  only \nother explanation the district court offered for its ruling \non HD90 is readily refuted by the undisputed evidence. \nAccording  to  the  district  court,  “no  one  considered  the \nlegal  significance  of  the  50%  [Spanish-surname-voter-\nregistration]  target  in  terms  of  compliance  with  the \nVRA.” H.J.S. App. 82a. But the record shows that plain-\ntiff  MALC  specifically  objected  to  the  initial  draft \namendment  to  HD90  on  the  ground  that  reducing  the",
        "32 \n\nSpanish-surname-voter-registration population in HD90 \nbelow  50%  would  substantially  dilute  Hispanic  voting \nstrength. J.A. 398a-403a.13  \n\nPlaintiffs  do  not  dispute  that  this  objection  directly \nmotivated  the  incumbent’s  chief  of  staff—whose  intent \nthe district court attributed to the Legislature—to con-\nsider racial data to maintain HD90’s Spanish-surname-\nvoter-registration majority.14 Instead, they blithely sug-\ngest that the Legislature should have simply refused to \nbring the Como neighborhood back into HD90. H.Br.54-\n55  &  n.15.  But  plaintiffs  tellingly  do  not  acknowledge \nthat Como is a predominantly African-American neigh-\nborhood—they describe it as “non-Latino,” H.Br.54—or \nthat residents of Como specifically asked to return their \nneighborhood  to  HD90,  where it  had  been  for  decades. \nH.J.S. App. 71a-72a. There was nothing unlawful about \nreturning  Como  to  HD90  so  long  as  the  Legislature \nmaintained HD90 as a majority-Hispanic district.  \n\nIndeed, even though the Legislature made sure that \nHD90 maintained a Hispanic voting majority, the State \nstill  faced  an  intentional-vote-dilution  claim  in  HD90. \nAnd  the  district  court  rejected  that  claim  only  because \nthe  Legislature  retained  HD90  as  a  majority-Hispanic \n\n13  Plaintiffs  cannot  avoid  that  evidence  based  on  “credibility \ndeterminations.”  H.Br.53.  They  identify  no  credibility  deter-\nmination  related  to  HD90,  and  none  appears  in  the  district \ncourt’s order. \n\n14  Plaintiffs  fault  the  Legislature  for  failing  to  compile  a  de-\ntailed administrative record in HD90, H.Br.54, but that is not \nrequired, see Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 966 (1996) (plurality \nop.);  accord  id.  at  1026  (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting),  and  it  does \nnot change the undisputed facts.",
        "33 \n\ndistrict. H.J.S. App. 83a-84a. If that does not qualify as \n“good  reason”  to  retain  a  majority-Hispanic  district, \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1470, then States have no breathing \nroom left to satisfy both the Constitution and the VRA. \n\nC O N C L U S IO N \n\nThe Court should reverse the district court’s orders \ninsofar as they invalidate districts in Plan C235 and Plan \nH358. \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\nPAUL D.

They  even  characterize  the  2013  Legisla-\nture’s enactment of the court-ordered plans as “legisla-\ntive inaction.” That is nonsensical. The districts plaintiffs \nchallenge are districts duly enacted by the 2013 Legisla-\nture. The intentions this Court must examine are there-\nfore the intentions of the 2013 Legislature. And plaintiffs \ncannot blind the Court to the reality that the 2013 Leg-\nislature enacted the 2013 maps only after those maps re-\nceived  the  imprimatur  of  a  federal  three-judge  district \ncourt.  \n\nPlaintiffs protest that the district court did not draw \nthe challenged districts in the first instance, and that its \n2012 decisions imposing the interim maps were “prelim-\ninary.”  But  that  misses  the  point.  Except  for  HD90, \nevery district invalidated below was subject to pending \nclaims in 2012. The district court was operating under a \nmandate to review those claims and impose maps “that \ndo not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights Act.” \nPerry v. Perez, 565 U.S. 388, 396 (2012) (per curiam). And \nthe  district  court  assured  the  parties  that  it  “obey[ed] \n[this] Court’s directive” and remedied all “plausible legal \ndefects” identified by plaintiffs’ claims against the 2011 \nmaps—as  the  district  court  was  required  to  do  for  all \nclaims  that  were  merely  “not  insubstantial”  under  the \nlower  VRA  §5  standard  set  forth  in  this  Court’s  Perry \ndecision. H.J.S. App. 313a; accord C.J.S. App. 408a.  \n\n(1) \n\n \n \n\f2 \n\nAccordingly,  even  accepting  the  fundamentally \nflawed notion that the 2013 Legislature was under some \nobligation to “remove” any “taint” of intentional discrim-\nination  from  the  court-ordered  maps,  the  district  court \nitself  had  already  concluded  that  no  such  taint  existed. \nThe  Legislature  cannot  plausibly  be  said  to  have  en-\ngaged in intentional discrimination by taking the district \ncourt  at  its  word—particularly  given  the  strong  “pre-\nsumption  of  good  faith”  to  which  the  Legislature’s  ac-\ntions  were  entitled  and  the  “extraordinary  caution” \ncourts  must  apply  when  confronting  claims  alleging  an \nunlawful legislative purpose. Miller v. Johnson, 515 U.S. \n900, 916 (1995).  \n\nThat is all the more true given the context in which \nthe  district  court’s  assurances  came.  By  the  time  the \ncourt  imposed  its  remedial  maps  in  2012,  there  had  al-\nready been: (1) a two-week trial and multiple rounds of \npost-trial  briefs  in  2011,  culminating  in  the  first  set  of \ncourt-ordered remedial maps; (2) an appeal resulting in \nthis  Court’s  Perry  opinion  vacating  those  maps;  and \n(3) post-remand  hearings  and  additional  briefing  on \npending claims—including briefing on claims in the par-\nallel §5 proceedings before the D.C. district court.  \n\nIf the district court truly believed that it lacked suffi-\ncient time to adequately address plaintiffs’ claims before \nissuing  remedial  maps,  it  would  have  revisited  those \nclaims immediately after the 2012 elections. And if it be-\nlieved  the  remedial  maps  incorporated  any  discrimina-\ntory “taint” that should have been apparent to the Leg-\nislature  when  it  adopted  the  court-ordered  districts  in \n2013, the district court could not have denied two motions \n\n \n \n\f3 \n\nto  enjoin  the  Legislature’s  2013  plans,  leaving  them  in \nplace for four years and two election cycles while it adju-\ndicated  moot  claims  against  the  repealed  2011  plans. \nThose are hardly the actions of a court concerned that it \nmay have violated this Court’s mandate to impose maps \n“that do not violate the Constitution or the Voting Rights \nAct.” Perry, 565 U.S. at 396. \n\nRather than point to any evidence that the Legisla-\nture  enacted  the  court-imposed  plans  for  a  discrimina-\ntory  purpose  (because  there  is  none),  plaintiffs  accuse \nthe  2013  Legislature  of  having  “rushed”  the  plans \nthrough.  That  is  manifestly  wrong:  The  Legislature  in \nfact heard nearly 33 hours of debate over 11 public hear-\nings,  after  which  it  held  floor  debates  spanning  over \n1,000 pages in the House and Senate journals. But it is \nalso beside the point. Plaintiffs’ burden was to prove that \nthe Legislature enacted those plans in a deliberate effort \nto sort voters on the basis of race or adversely affect mi-\nnority  voters.  Even  assuming  (contrary  to  reality)  that \nthe  Legislature  had  “rushed”  the  maps  through,  that \nwould  not  begin  to  prove  that  the  Legislature  enacted \ncourt-imposed remedial districts for an illicit purpose.  \n\nMoreover, plaintiffs do not dispute that it is not pos-\nsible  to  draw  additional  performing  majority-minority \ndistricts, as defined in Bartlett v. Strickland, 556 U.S. 1, \n15  (2009)  (plurality  op.),  in  either  the  congressional  or \nstate-house plans—even though nine groups of plaintiffs \nand multiple experts spent more than six years trying to \ndo so. That shows that plaintiffs’ case is not about legal \ndefects in the State’s maps or the makeup of the State’s \n\n \n \n\f4 \n\nlegislative delegations; it is about plaintiffs’ desire to re-\nimpose preclearance on the State of Texas after Shelby \nCounty v. Holder, 570 U.S. 529 (2013). \n\nIn the end, then, plaintiffs are forced to spend most \nof  their  time  complaining  about  the  motivations  of  the \n2011  Legislature.  Those  complaints  are  unfounded,  as \nthe district court correctly concluded in 2012 and Judge \nSmith’s dissent rightly recognized in 2017. But they are \nultimately irrelevant, as this case is about the actions of \nthe 2013 Legislature, and plaintiffs did not come close to \nmeeting their burden of proving an unlawful purpose—\nwith or without the strong presumption of good faith to \nwhich those actions are entitled.  \n\nI.  This  Court  Has  Jurisdiction  To  Review  The  Dis-\n\ntrict Court’s Orders.  \n\nThe  three-judge  district  court  issued  orders  on  the \neve of election deadlines that had the practical effect of \nblocking  the  State  from  using  its  existing  redistricting \nplans for the 2018 elections. The orders did much more \nthan merely invalidate districts in Plans C235 and H358. \nThe  court  concluded  that  these  purported  violations \n“now  require  a  remedy”  and “must  be  remedied  either \nby  the  Texas  Legislature  or  this  Court.”  C.J.S.  App. \n118a-119a; see H.J.S. App. 84a, 86a. And it gave the Gov-\nernor just three days to call a special session or, failing \nthat, ordered defendants to participate in expedited ju-\ndicial redistricting. There can be no serious dispute that \nif the State had responded by declining to redistrict and \nnotifying  the  court  that  it  would  still  use  the  existing \nplans in the 2018 elections, defendants would have been \nheld in contempt. Tellingly, plaintiffs do not even try to \n\n \n \n\f5 \n\nclaim  there  was  any  prospect  that  the  State  could  still \nuse  Plans  C235  or  H358  in  the  2018  elections.  That \nshould  be  the  end  of  the  matter,  as  it  is  plain  that  the \ndistrict court prohibited the State from using its maps in \nfurther elections. \n\nPlaintiffs nonetheless insist that this Court lacks ju-\nrisdiction under the “plain language” of 28 U.S.C. §1253 \nbecause the district court did not label its order an “in-\njunction.”  H.Br.29.1  In  other  words,  they  insist  that \n§1253 imposes a magic-words test. That is the only way \nto understand their contention (H.Br.29, 30-31) that this \nCourt lacks jurisdiction here despite having jurisdiction \nin  Cooper  v.  Harris,  137  S. Ct.  1455  (2017),  and  Gill  v. \nWhitford,  No.  16-1161  (U.S.)—cases  where  district \ncourts also invalidated districts and ordered the States \nto  pass  new  plans,  but  had  not  yet  imposed  remedial \nplans  when  the  States  appealed. But this Court has al-\nready rejected a magic-words test in Carson v. Ameri-\ncan  Brands,  Inc.,  holding  that  appellate  jurisdiction \nturns on the “practical effect” of a court’s order—not its \nlabel or its precise “terms.” 450 U.S. 79, 83-84 (1981).  \n\nPlaintiffs try to limit Carson to 28 U.S.C. §1292(a)(1) \nappeals,  H.Br.30,  but  nothing  in  the  text  of  28  U.S.C. \n§§1253 or 1292 could justify a functional approach for one \nand a magic-words test for the other. Section 1292(a)(1) \n\n1  The  abbreviation  “Br.”  refers  to  the  Brief  for  Appellants; \n“U.S.Br.” refers to the Brief for the United States as Appellee \nin  Support  of  Appellants;  “C.Br.”  refers  to  the  Brief  for  Ap-\npellees  (Congressional  Districts);  and  “H.Br.”  refers  to  the \nBrief for Appellees Other than the United States (State House \nDistricts). \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f6 \n\nvests  courts  with  jurisdiction  over  “[i]nterlocutory  or-\nders  . . .  granting  . . .  injunctions,”  and  §1253  vests  this \nCourt with jurisdiction over “an order granting . . . an in-\nterlocutory . . . injunction.” The fact that §1292(a)(1) does \nnot apply “where a direct review may be had in the Su-\npreme Court” is relevant only to determining the source \nof  this  Court’s  jurisdiction—not  to  determining  what \nqualifies as an “injunction.” Nor does it make any differ-\nence  that  §1253  is  interpreted  narrowly.  H.Br.29-30. \nCarson  acknowledged  that  §1292  is  interpreted  “nar-\nrowly” too, yet that did not stop the Court from holding \nthat  an  order  is  appealable  under  §1292  if  it  has  the \n“practical effect” of an injunction. 450 U.S. at 84.  \n\nThis Court’s decision in Gunn v. University Commit-\nted  to  End  the  War  in  Viet  Nam,  399  U.S.  383  (1970), \ndoes not help plaintiffs either. In Gunn, the district court \nstayed its order finding a First Amendment overbreadth \nviolation, then “entered no further order of any kind.” Id. \nat 387. Moreover, the initial order was wholly unclear as \nto what “was to be enjoined” and “against whom” any or-\nder would run, leading appellants themselves to concede \nthat it was really an “advisory opinion.” Id. at 388, 389. \nHere, by contrast, there is no doubt about the who, what, \nor  when:  The  district  court  ordered  the  State  immedi-\nately to engage in expedited redistricting, and expressly \nrefused  to  stay  its  order  “pending  the  next  session”  of \nthe  Texas  Legislature,  as  the  court  in Gunn  had  done. \n\n \n \n\f7 \n\nId. at 386. The district court thus placed the State in pre-\ncisely the same situation as the States in Gill and Cooper, \nwhere this Court exercised appellate jurisdiction.2  \n\nPlaintiffs assert that the State’s position “transforms \nevery declaration of a violation into a de facto injunction.” \nH.Br.33. Far from it. Declaratory relief, by itself, is in-\nsufficient  to  invoke  this  Court’s  appellate  jurisdiction. \nMitchell v. Donovan, 398 U.S. 427, 430-31 (1970) (per cu-\nriam). But where an order goes beyond declaring rights \nand compels the State to engage in immediate redistrict-\ning on the eve of election deadlines, there is no escaping \nthe conclusion that the State has been enjoined from us-\ning its existing map. This Court’s jurisdiction is just as \nclear here as it was in Cooper and Gill. \n\nII.  The  Legislature  Did  Not  Engage  In  Intentional \nDiscrimination  When  It  Enacted  Districts  Im-\nposed By The District Court Itself. \n\nThe district court reached the remarkable conclusion \nthat  the  Texas  Legislature  engaged  in  intentional  dis-\ncrimination when it adopted as its own the same districts \nthat the court itself ordered the State to use in the 2012 \nelections. Try as they do, plaintiffs cannot justify that un-\nprecedented and untenable result. Plaintiffs attempt to \nrecharacterize  the  district  court’s  decision  as  resting \nsolely on factual findings about the Legislature’s intent, \n\n2  Whitcomb  v.  Chavis,  403  U.S.  914  (1971),  is  also  consistent \nwith  exercising  jurisdiction,  as  it  was  an  unexplained  order \ndismissing for lack of jurisdiction where expedited redistrict-\ning had not been ordered. See U.S.Br.23. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f8 \n\nin hopes of cloaking it in clear-error review. But the dis-\ntrict court did not make any finding that the Legislature \nacted with improper intent in 2013—because the court’s \nfatally  flawed  “remove  the  taint”  theory  obviated  the \nneed to do so. Nor could the court have made any such \nfinding, as plaintiffs’ paltry evidence does not come close \nto establishing intentional discrimination, let alone over-\ncoming  the  strong  presumption  that  the  Legislature’s \ndecision to enact the court’s own maps was a good-faith \neffort to comply with the Constitution and the VRA and \nbring this already-protracted litigation to an end.  \n\nA.  The  District  Court’s  Intentional  Discrimina-\ntion Analysis Rests on a Fatally Flawed Legal \nStandard. \n\nPlaintiffs’ efforts to defend the district court’s inten-\ntional-discrimination holding as a factual finding entitled \nto clear-error review, H.Br.41-43; C.Br.1, 40, fail at the \nthreshold.  The  district  court  never  found  that  the  2013 \nLegislature enacted Plan C235 or H358 for an unconsti-\ntutional  purpose—that  is,  in  a  deliberate  effort  to  sort \nvoters on the basis of race, Miller, 515 U.S. at 916-17, or \n“‘because of,’ not merely ‘in spite of,’ its adverse effects \nupon  an  identifiable  group,”  Pers.  Adm’r  of  Mass.  v. \nFeeney,  442  U.S.  256,  279  (1979).  Instead,  the  court \nfaulted the State for failing to prove that the Legislature \n“remove[d]”  the  purported  “discriminatory  taint”  from \nthe court-imposed plans before adopting them as its own. \nC.J.S. App. 46a. \n\nThat reasoning is wrong at every turn. First, it evis-\ncerates  both  the  strong  “presumption  of  good  faith”  to \n\n \n \n\f9 \n\nwhich  legislative  enactments  are  entitled  and  the  “ex-\ntraordinary caution” courts must employ when confront-\ning unlawful-purpose claims. Miller, 515 U.S. at 916. If \nanything, the “normal presumption of good faith” should \nhave been “heightened by the State’s acceptance of the \njudicial plan.” U.S.Br.30. Instead, the district court not \nonly ignored the presumption, but reversed it, demand-\ning  that  defendants  prove  that  the  maps  were  not \n“tainted” with “discriminatory intent.” \n\nFor the most part, plaintiffs ignore the presumption \nof good faith as well. One of their briefs never even men-\ntions it, while the other contends that it does not apply \nbecause the districts imposed by the court in 2012 were \n“entirely a product of lines drawn by the Legislature” in \n2011. H.Br.36-37. That is wrong as a factual matter, infra \npp.12-14, but it is also beside the point. While the United \nStates is undoubtedly correct that the presumption ap-\nplies with particular force given that the Legislature en-\nacted court-imposed maps, the presumption is fully ap-\nplicable  even  on  the  assumption  that  those  maps  were \n“legislatively drawn.” H.Br.27. After all, the whole point \nof the presumption is to give the benefit of the doubt to \n“legislative enactments,” Miller, 515 U.S. at 916, which \nthe  2013  maps  undoubtedly  were.  The  presumption  of \ngood faith did not disappear just because an earlier leg-\nislature  enacted  different  maps  with  purportedly  dis-\ncriminatory intent.  \n\nHunter v. Underwood, 471 U.S. 222 (1985), does not \nsuggest otherwise. “Hunter did not involve a subsequent \nlegislative enactment at all,” U.S.Br.33, let alone a sub-\nsequent legislative enactment codifying a judicial order. \n\n \n \n\f10 \n\nThere, the legislature merely sat on its hands while the \ncourts  struck  down  various  provisions  of  a  law  admit-\ntedly  passed  with  discriminatory  intent,  U.S.Br.30-31, \nand this Court expressly reserved judgment on whether \nthe  same  law  “would  be  valid  if  enacted  today  without \nany  impermissible  motivation.”  471  U.S.  at  233.  Here, \nthe  Texas  Legislature  adopted  different  plans  that  the \ndistrict  court  concluded  remedied  any  “plausible”  legal \ndefects in the 2011 plans. H.J.S. App. 313a.  \n\nRelying on Justice Thomas’s concurrence in United \nStates v. Fordice, 505 U.S. 717, 746-47 (1992), plaintiffs \nalso  suggest  that  the  presumption  is  not  warranted \nwhere  there  is  a  history  of  discrimination.  H.Br.46-47. \nBut Fordice involved policies continued from a “de jure \nsystem”  of  racial  segregation  in  public  schools—and \neven then, the Court still required ongoing “discrimina-\ntory effects” to prove liability. 505 U.S. at 745 (Thomas, \nJ., concurring) (quoting id. at 729 (majority op.)). As Jus-\ntice Thomas’s concurrence made clear, the Court consid-\nered “the historical background of the policy, the degree \nof its adverse impact, and the plausibility of any justifi-\ncation asserted in its defense,” but it did “not formulate \n[its] standard in terms of a burden shift with respect to \nintent.” Id. at 747. \n\nOf course, the bare act of reenactment cannot “save” \notherwise  invalid  legislation  “from  invalidity,”  C.Br.31 \nn.17, or “insulate” districts “from further challenge, re-\ngardless  of  their  legal  infirmities,”  H.Br.20.  Reenact-\nment has no bearing on claims of discriminatory effects, \nand  it  does  not  definitively  answer  the  question  of  dis-\n\n \n \n\f11 \n\ncriminatory intent. Reenactment does, however, funda-\nmentally alter the object of the intent analysis, which is \nthe intent of the legislature that enacted the challenged \nlaw. And while a court need not blind itself to the history \nbehind  a  law’s  enactment  in  assessing  that  intent,  the \nnew  legislation  does  not  lose  its  presumption  of  good \nfaith  just  because  a  previous  legislature  enacted  the \nsame law with an allegedly illicit purpose. See U.S.Br.28-\n30.  \n\nRegardless,  whatever  questions  may  arise  when  a \nlegislature enacts the same law but “manufacture[s] new \nlegislative records,” C.Br.28, that is manifestly not what \nhappened here. Far from reenacting the 2011 maps, the \n2013 Legislature repealed them and replaced them with \nmaps imposed by the district court itself, which changed \n9 congressional and 28 state-house districts. To be sure, \nthose maps retained some aspects of the 2011 plans, but \nit is neither unusual nor legally suspect for a new law to \nretain aspects of its predecessor, and that certainly does \nnot convert separate districting legislation into “legisla-\ntive  inaction.”  C.Br.27-28.  Accordingly,  the  2013  plans \nwere entitled to the same presumption of good faith as \nany other districting plans, and could be invalidated only \nif plaintiffs satisfied their heavy burden of proving that \nthe legislature enacted the court-imposed maps in a de-\nliberate effort to sort voters on the basis of race, Miller, \n515 U.S. at 916, or “because of” some unlawful “adverse \neffects”  on  minority  voters,  Feeney,  442  U.S.  at  279. \n\n \n \n\f12 \n\nPlaintiffs cannot short-circuit that analysis by complain-\ning about the motivations of a different legislature in en-\nacting a different law.3 \n\nB.  There Is No Evidence that the 2013 Legislature \n\nEngaged in Intentional Discrimination.  \n\nUnable to defend the district court’s legal reasoning, \nplaintiffs resort to distorting the record. But their efforts \ndo not bring them any closer to meeting their heavy bur-\nden  of  proving  that  the  Legislature  engaged  in  inten-\ntional discrimination.  \n\n1. Plaintiffs first try to avoid the presumption of good \nfaith by insisting that the court-imposed plans were not \nreally “the court’s” because they retained some districts \nfrom the 2011 plans. H.Br.36 (emphasis added). That ar-\ngument misses the point. Defendants have never claimed \nthat  everything  in  the  court-ordered  maps  was  “the \ncourt’s idea.” H.Br.37. There is no dispute that the court \nretained some districts from the 2011 maps. But that is \nnot an accident, or the product of some hoodwinking by \ndefendants.  It  is  a  direct  and  intended  consequence  of \nthis  Court’s  decision  in  Perry,  which  specifically  in-\nstructed the district court to “take care not to incorpo-\nrate into the interim plan any legal defects in the state \nplan,” but to preserve districts that were not subject to \n“not insubstantial” §5 claims or to constitutional or VRA \n\n3  Indeed,  plaintiffs  previously  insisted  on  separate  trials  for \nthe 2011 and 2013 plans because “the state actors responsible \nfor  creating  the  2011  and  2013  redistricting  plans  are  differ-\nent.”  Plaintiffs’  Advisory  in  Support  of  Proposed  Scheduling \nOrder at 4 (Oct. 9, 2013), ECF No. 921. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f13 \n\n§2 challenges that were “likely to succeed on the merits.” \n565 U.S. at 394.  \n\nAnd  that  is  precisely  what  the  district  court  did.  It \nordered the State to use the 2012 maps only after care-\nfully reviewing all pending claims against the 2011 maps \nand  concluding  that  every  “plausible”  legal  defect  had \nbeen  remedied.  H.J.S.  App.  313a.  Plaintiffs  claim  that \nthe  Legislature  was  not  entitled  to  rely  on  the  district \nthey  were  “preliminary.” \ncourt’s  orders  because \nH.Br.37. But the district court assured the parties that it \n“obey[ed]  [this]  Court’s  directive  by  adhering  to  the \nState’s enacted plan except in the discrete areas in which \nwe have preliminarily found plausible legal defects under \nthe  standards  of  review  the  Court  has  announced.” \nH.J.S.  App.  313a.  Preliminary  or  not,  the  Legislature \nwas  certainly  entitled  to  take  the  district  court  at  its \nword that it had complied with this Court’s mandate “to \ndraw  interim  maps  that  do  not violate the Constitution \nor the Voting Rights Act.” Perry, 565 U.S. at 396.  \n\nPlaintiffs’ claim that the district court’s 2012 orders \n“did nothing more than decline to enter a preliminary in-\njunction” against the unprecleared 2011 plans is demon-\nstrably false. H.Br.28. The district court had already en-\ntered  a  preliminary  injunction  against  those  plans  in \n2011. J.A. 17a. In 2012, the court affirmatively ordered \nthe State to conduct its upcoming elections under plans \nthat  had  been  reviewed,  approved,  and  substantially \nmodified, with changes to 9 congressional and 28 state-\nhouse districts. C.J.S. App. 423a (“This Court has inde-\npendently  reviewed  Plan  C235 . . . .”);  H.J.S.  App.  315a \n(referring  to  “this  Court’s  independently  drawn  Plan \n\n \n \n\f14 \n\nH309”).  The  court  did  so,  moreover,  after  having  con-\nducted two weeks of trial, held several days of hearings, \nand received hundreds of pages of briefing on plaintiffs’ \nclaims—including  additional  briefing  and  hearings  fol-\nlowing  this  Court’s  remand.  J.A.  4a-20a;  C.J.S.  App. \n380a. That is a world apart from cases where parties “re-\nlied on a short stipulation of facts” and underdeveloped \nlegal theories, Univ. of Tex. v. Camenisch, 451 U.S. 390, \n398  (1981),  and  where  the  district  court  was  “discon-\ncerted by the hurried character of the proceeding” that \noccurred the day after the preliminary injunction motion \nwas filed, Sole v. Wyner, 551 U.S. 74, 79 (2007). \n\nIn  short,  the  notion  that  the  district  court  in  2012 \n“simply  ‘defer[red]’”  to  the  preferences  of  the  Legisla-\nture,  H.Br.19,  strains  credulity.  The  court  imposed  the \n2012  maps  only  after  careful  consideration  of  the  very \nsame challenges pressed here, and with the express as-\nsurance that they addressed all “plausible legal defects” \nin the 2011 plans. H.J.S. App. 313a. The Legislature did \nnot  engage  in  intentional  discrimination  by  taking  the \ndistrict court at its word. \n\n2. Plaintiffs next insist that “the Legislature did not \nactually believe that ‘passing the interim maps would end \nthe litigation.’” H.Br.43. If they mean that the Legisla-\nture knew plaintiffs would continue to fight them no mat-\nter what maps they passed, then they are certainly cor-\nrect.  The  Legislature  did,  however,  have  an  eminently \ngood-faith basis to believe that the district court would \nnot invalidate the maps that it had just ordered the State \nto  use.  Plaintiffs  cite  no  evidence  for  their  charge  that \nthe 2013 Legislature enacted districts because they were \n\n \n \n\f15 \n\nallegedly  “drawn  in  2011  for  discriminatory  reasons.” \nH.Br.45.4 And there is nothing remotely constitutionally \nsuspect about adopting new maps because they are more \nlikely than the previous maps to satisfy the Constitution \nand VRA. After all, it would be a strange doctrine indeed \nthat viewed with suspicion efforts by subsequent legisla-\ntures to remedy the perceived missteps of their prede-\ncessors.  \n\nPlaintiffs  protest  that  the  2013  redistricting  plans \nwere  adopted  too  “‘quickly,’  with  no  real  discussion  of \ndistrict  configurations.”  H.Br.43.  Nonsense.  The  redis-\ntricting legislation was under consideration for 22 days—\nalmost the entire 30-day special session. Br. Stat. App. \n34a, 36a; Tex. Const. art. III, §40. The House and Senate \ncommittees held more than 30 hours of public hearings \nin multiple cities, resulting in more than 1,300 transcript \npages. See 2017 JX-10-15, 20-24. And the separate floor \ndebate accounted for more than 1,000 pages in the Texas \nHouse and Senate Journals. See 2017 JX-17-18; 2017 JX-\n26-27. The Legislature adopted multiple amendments to \nPlan  H309,  and  it  considered  several  amendments  to \nPlan  C235,  most  of  which  were  rejected  on  bipartisan \nvotes  in  the  Senate  Redistricting  Committee.  See  2017 \nJX-24.4.  \n\nPlaintiffs charge the Legislature with “[w]illfully ig-\nnor[ing] those who pointed out deficiencies” in the court-\nordered plans. C.Br.21 (citing C.J.S. App. 45a n.45). But \n\n4 As for supposed “self-contradictory statements” by “legisla-\ntive  leaders,”  H.Br.43,  the  cited  footnote  (H.J.S.  App.  358a \nn.45) does not identify any such statement.  \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f16 \n\nneither the district court nor plaintiffs identified a single \n“deficiency”  that  was  “pointed  out”  to  the  Legislature \nbut ignored.5 Jeff Archer, an attorney at the Texas Leg-\nislative Council, did not identify any “deficiency” in the \ncourt-ordered  plans.  Instead,  his  cited  testimony  con-\nsists  only  of  general  statements  about  the  procedural \nposture \nissued.  See \nU.S.Br.42.  Notably,  Archer  specifically  declined  to  dis-\ncuss  the  “validity”  or  “legal  ramifications”  of  any  pro-\nposed alternative plan. See 2017 JX-14.4 at 7. Plaintiffs’ \ncounsel  MALDEF,  by  contrast,  informed  the  Legisla-\nture  that  these  remedial  plans  addressed  every  defect \nidentified by the D.C. district court under VRA §5. C.J.S. \nApp. 436a-439a. \n\nin  which  those  orders  were \n\nPlaintiffs also argue that the “legislative findings re-\ngarding  the  2013  [state-house]  plan  were  in  fact  pro-\nduced  ahead  of  time  by  the  Texas  Attorney  General.” \nH.Br.43. But the Attorney General’s advice to the Legis-\nlature to make its legislative findings part of the statu-\ntory text says nothing about the Legislature’s purpose. \nAnd there is no evidence that the Legislature did not be-\nlieve those findings—let alone that it did not believe the \n\n5  Nor  was  there  any  “‘steadfast  refusal’  to  consider  creating \nadditional minority opportunity districts.” H.Br.20. Plaintiffs \nare really complaining about the Legislature’s decision not to \ncreate  additional  crossover  or  coalition  districts,  which,  as \nplaintiffs’  congressional  brief  concedes  (C.Br.4  n.2),  are  not \nthe same thing as “minority opportunity districts.” The failure \nto adopt crossover or coalition districts cannot support a find-\ning  of  intentional  discrimination,  as  VRA  §2  does  not  require \neither one. See Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 15. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f17 \n\ndistrict  court’s  express  assurance  that  it  followed  this \nCourt’s  directives.  See  C.J.S.  App.  423a;  H.J.S.  App. \n313a. \n\nRather than engage the legislative history, plaintiffs \ndistort the timeline to create a false impression that the \n2013  Legislature  reenacted  districts  after  the  district \ncourt  had  already  found  them  “tainted”  by  intentional \ndiscrimination.  In  Bell  County,  for  example,  where  the \nLegislature  did  not  change  the  district  boundaries  in \n2013, plaintiffs assert that “[t]he court had earlier found \nthat  in  configuring  the  Bell  County  districts,  Repre-\nsentative  Aycock  had  deliberately  ‘divided  the  growing \nminority  City  of  Killeen  to  protect  his  incumbency.’” \nH.Br.22 (citing H.J.S. Supp. App. 289a). In fact, the dis-\ntrict  court  reached  that  conclusion  nearly  four  years \nlater, in its 2017 advisory opinion on the 2011 maps. The \n2013  Legislature  obviously  could  not  have  “intended  to \ncontinue  the  intentional  discrimination  found  in  Plan \nH283,”  H.Br.22  (quoting  H.J.S.  App.  22a),  when  there \nwas no such “finding” until 2017. \n\n3.  Finally,  plaintiffs’  post-hoc  efforts  to  undermine \nthe conclusions the district court reached in 2012 are en-\ntirely  unfounded,  and  provide  no  basis  to  question  the \nLegislature’s good faith in relying on the district court’s \nexpress assurance that it followed this Court’s mandate \nto impose maps that complied with the Constitution and \nthe VRA.  \n\nFirst,  plaintiffs’  allegation  that  the  court  was  not \naware in 2012 that “it was possible to draw two majority \n\n \n \n\f18 \n\nHCVAP districts” in Nueces County, H.Br.38, is irrele-\nvant. Mapdrawers relied on Spanish-surname-voter-reg-\nistration data when drawing House districts in 2011 be-\ncause citizen-voting-age-population data were not avail-\nable  until  late  April.  H.J.S. App.  129a.  There  is  no  evi-\ndence that they deliberately refused to consider HCVAP \ndata.  In  any  case,  Texas  Legislative  Council  attorneys \ncorrectly  advised  that  two  performing  Hispanic-oppor-\ntunity  districts  could  not  be  drawn  in  Nueces  County. \nH.J.S. Supp. App. 93a. The Legislature’s decision not to \ndivide Nueces County in a way that would have diluted \nHispanic  voting  strength  is  not  evidence  of  intentional \ndiscrimination.  \n\nSecond, Representative Aycock’s testimony at retrial \nin 2014, H.Br.38, does not support a conclusion of inten-\ntional  discrimination  or  racial  predominance  in  HD54. \nHe merely testified that he attempted to create a Repub-\nlican  district  by  adding  areas  that  supported  Republi-\ncans. Br.54-56. Drawing a Republican district is not ra-\ncial discrimination, “even if it so happens that the most \nloyal Democrats happen to be [minorities] and even if the \nState  were  conscious  of  that  fact.” Hunt  v.  Cromartie , \n526 U.S. 541, 551 (1999). In any event, the district court \ncorrectly rejected the only claims that plaintiffs actually \nbrought in Bell County. Infra pp.26-27.  \n\nThird, plaintiffs’ claim that the court had not “heard \nfrom the architect of the challenged districts in western \nDallas  County”  in  2012  is  simply  wrong.  H.Br.38.  That \nindividual (Ryan Downton) gave extensive live testimony \n\n \n \n\f19 \n\nin  2011,  see  2011  Tr.  903-1023,  which  the  district  court \ncited in its 2012 opinion. C.J.S. App. 411a, 414a, 422a. \n\n* \n\n* \n\n* \n\nAt bottom, neither the record nor common sense sup-\nports the district court’s implausible conclusion that the \nLegislature engaged in intentional discrimination when \nit embraced court-imposed districts as its own. Plaintiffs \ndo  not  even  try  to  explain  how  the  very  same  districts \ncould be lawful when imposed by the district court, but \n“tainted” with discriminatory intent when later enacted \nby the Legislature.  \n\nIII. There  Never  Was  Any  Vote  Dilution  Or  Racial \nGerrymandering  To  Begin  With  In  The  Districts \nImposed By The District Court In 2012. \n\nBy the time the district court held a second trial on \nclaims against the 2011 maps, those maps had been re-\npealed, rendering any dispute about the motivations un-\nderlying them moot—a proposition that plaintiffs barely \neven bother to contest. That said, the district court’s “re-\nmove  the  taint”  theory  fails  on  its  own  terms  because \nthere  never  was  any  “taint”  to  “remove”  in  the  first \nplace.6 \n\n6 To the extent the district court found intentional discrimina-\ntion based on one-person, one-vote violations (see Br.56-58, 62-\n63), plaintiffs have waived those arguments by choosing not to \ndefend them on appeal. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f20 \n\nA.  There  Was  No  Vote  Dilution  in  Districts  Im-\n\nposed by the District Court in 2012. \n\n1.  Intentional-vote-dilution  claims \n\nrequire \n\nproof of an actual vote-dilution effect. \n\nAt  the  outset,  all  of  the  district  court’s  intentional-\nvote-dilution findings were infected by its erroneous con-\nclusion that intention-vote-dilution claims do not require \nproof of vote dilution. Intentional-vote-dilution claims re-\nquire  proof  of  both  intent  to  dilute  minority  voting \nstrength and actual dilution of minority voting strength. \nSee, e.g., Shaw v. Reno, 509 U.S. 630, 641 (1993) (explain-\ning  that  districts  “violate  the  Fourteenth  Amendment \nwhen  they  are  adopted  with  a  discriminatory  purpose \nand  have  the  effect  of  diluting  minority  voting \nstrength”).  Those  requirements  do  not  change  just  be-\ncause  a  plaintiff  alleges  that  vote  dilution  was  “inten-\ntional.” \n\nPlaintiffs cannot escape that conclusion by asserting \na  constitutional  rather  than  a  VRA  claim,  because  the \nConstitution no more recognizes an intentional-vote-di-\nlution claim without vote dilution than the VRA does. To \nthe  contrary,  the  constitutional  test  for  vote  dilution  is \nmore demanding than the VRA test, as it requires both \ndiscriminatory  effects  and  discriminatory  intent.  See, \ne.g., City of Mobile v. Bolden, 446 U.S. 55, 66-68 (1980) \n(plurality  op.).  As  Gingles  explained,  VRA  §2  “was  de-\nsigned  to  restore  the  ‘results  test’—the  legal  standard \nthat governed voting discrimination cases prior to [this \nCourt’s] decision in Mobile,” under which discriminatory \neffects alone were enough to establish a constitutional vi-\nolation. Thornburg v. Gingles, 478 U.S. 30, 44 n.8 (1986). \n\n \n \n\f21 \n\nAccordingly, while the Constitution demands discrimina-\ntory intent and discriminatory effects after Mobile, VRA \n§2 now requires only the latter. But plaintiffs do not and \ncannot  cite  precedent  holding  that  the  Constitution  re-\nquires only the former.  \n\nInstead, plaintiffs rely principally on cases involving \nVRA §5. See H.Br.48.7 But those cases are readily distin-\nguishable, as that statute requires the State to prove that \nits voting laws do not have either a discriminatory pur-\npose  or  a  discriminatory  effect.  See  City  of  Pleasant \nGrove v. United States, 479 U.S. 462, 471 (1987); City of \nRichmond  v.  United  States,  422  U.S.  358,  378  (1975). \nThis Court has expressly refused, however, “to equate a \n§ 2 vote dilution inquiry with the § 5 retrogression stand-\nard.” Georgia v. Ashcroft, 539 U.S. 461, 478 (2003). And \nit has certainly never equated the §5 standard with the \nEqual  Protection  Clause,  which  requires  plaintiffs  to \nprove both discriminatory intent and discriminatory ef-\nfects.  \n\nTo the extent cases suggest, in dicta, that a law with \na race-based purpose “has no legitimacy at all under our \nConstitution,” see Pleasant Grove, 479 U.S. at 471 n.11, \nthis  Court’s  modern  precedents  recognize  that  as  a  ra-\ncial-gerrymandering  claim.  For  example,  Garza  v. \nCounty of Los Angeles, 918 F.2d 763 (9th Cir. 1990), cited \nin Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 20, was decided before this Court \nrecognized  racial-gerrymandering  claims  in  1993  in \n\n7  Plaintiffs  also  cite Rogers  v.  Lodge ,  458  U.S.  613  (1982), \nH.Br.48, but that case involved actual vote-dilution effect. See \n458 U.S. at 623-27. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f22 \n\nShaw,  509  U.S.  at  649.  Under  the  Court’s  current  doc-\ntrine, the appropriate claim in Garza would be racial ger-\nrymandering, because the county redistricted “with the \nintent to fragment the Hispanic population” among vari-\nous districts—even though no vote dilution actually oc-\ncurred. 918 F.2d at 770. \n\nTo establish an intentional-vote-dilution claim, then, \nplaintiffs  must  establish  both  that  the  Legislature  in-\ntended  to  dilute  minority  voting  strength  and  that  the \nLegislature succeeded in doing so. And to establish the \nlatter, plaintiffs must prove that it was possible to draw \nan additional performing majority-minority district. See, \ne.g., Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 15; LULAC v. Perry, 548 U.S. \n399,  430  (2006).  As  plaintiffs’  congressional  brief  cor-\nrectly recognizes, “[a] minority opportunity district un-\nder §2 is one in which minority voters [1] comprise a ma-\njority of eligible voters and [2] have a reasonable oppor-\ntunity to elect candidates of their choice.” C.Br.4 n.2. Ac-\ncordingly,  plaintiffs  cannot  establish  vote  dilution  by \nfaulting the Legislature for declining to draw a coalition \ndistrict. But see H.Br.49 (alleging intentional vote dilu-\ntion in Bell County because the “legislature’s decision to \nsplit Killeen minimized the voting strength of a multi-mi-\nnority  coalition”).  This  Court  has  recognized  that  VRA \n§2 does not require States to draw coalition districts. See \nPerry, 565 U.S. at 398 (citing Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 13-15). \nAnd  with  good  reason,  as  requiring  coalition  districts \nwould only inject further considerations of race into re-\ndistricting. Bartlett, 556 U.S. at 21-22. \n\n \n \n\f23 \n\nPlaintiffs  nonetheless  persist  in  urging  a  much \nbroader conception of vote dilution, insisting that it ex-\nists  “whenever  the  challenged  district  makes  it  harder \nfor the minority community to participate effectively in \nthe political process.” H.Br.49. That attempt to replace \nthe long-settled definition of vote dilution with an unde-\nfined  “discernible  discriminatory  effect”  standard, \nH.Br.28, smacks of an effort to resuscitate the VRA §5 \nretrogression standard, which considers “the diminution \nof  a  minority  group’s  effective  exercise  of  the  electoral \nfranchise.” Ashcroft, 539 U.S. at 479. But this Court has \nexpressly refused to export that standard to the VRA §2 \nor Equal Protection Clause contexts.  \n\nIn  sum,  a  challenged  apportionment  scheme  either \nresults in dilution of minority voting strength or it does \nnot. Alleging intentional vote dilution adds the element \nof  discriminatory  intent,  but  it  does  not  change  the  re-\nquirement to prove that vote dilution actually occurred. \nThe district court’s contrary belief fatally infected all of \nits intentional-vote-dilution findings on the 2013 plans. \n\n2.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \n\nin CD27. \n\nUnder a correct understanding of the law, plaintiffs \ndid  not  and  could  not  prove  intentional  vote  dilution  in \nCD27.8  The  district  court  sustained  plaintiffs’  claim  on \n\n8  The  district  court  “did not  base  its  holdings  . . .  on  a  §  2  ef-\nfects  claim”  in  CD27.  C.J.S.  App.  113a-114a;  id.  at  113a  n.85 \n(“If  . . .  there  was  no  evidence  of  improper  intent,  this  would \nbe a different case . . . .”). Regardless, there was no vote-dilu-\ntion effect in CD27. Br.48-51. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f24 \n\nthe  theory  that  intent  alone  was  enough.  C.J.S.  App. \n112a-114a & n.85; cf. U.S.Br.16-17. In fact, the court ex-\npressly  found  that  CD27  does  “not  diminish  Hispanic \nvoter opportunity for § 2 effects purposes” because “no \nadditional compact Latino opportunity district could be \ndrawn”  in  the  region—a  finding  plaintiffs  do  not  chal-\nlenge. C.J.S. App. 113a; see C.Br.51. That should be the \nend of the matter, as a vote-dilution claim cannot survive \nwithout  proof  of  vote  dilution.  See  supra  Part  III.A.1. \nPlaintiffs nonetheless argue that their §2 rights were vi-\nolated  because  certain  Hispanic  voters  in  CD27  could \nhave been included in an existing majority-minority dis-\ntrict  elsewhere  (CD34,  anchored  in  Cameron  County). \nBut that is not a viable theory of vote dilution under §2 \nor the Constitution (or even a §5 retrogression problem, \nas  the  D.C.  district  court  rightly  concluded,  Texas  v. \nUnited  States,  887  F. Supp. 2d  133,  153  (D.D.C.  2012), \nvacated, 133 S. Ct. 2885 (2013) (mem.)).  \n\nAt any rate, there was no intentional discrimination \nin CD27 to begin with. The 2011 Legislature’s decision to \nmove  Nueces  County  to  a  separate  district  from  Cam-\neron  County  had  nothing  to  do  with  Hispanic  voters  in \nNueces County or with Travis County or CD35. The de-\ncision  was  instead  made  at  the  request  of  citizens  and \nlegislators in both Nueces and Cameron Counties, Br.51-\n52—and  was  made  at  the  beginning  of  the  2011  redis-\ntricting  process,  before  the  Legislature  had  even  re-\nceived census data. Aug. 2014 Tr. 1761-62, 1772-73. Plain-\ntiffs refuse to respond to that evidence, C.Br.45, and they \ndo not identify any contrary evidence, or even any sup-\nposed  “inconsistencies”  in  the  record,  C.Br.47.  That  is \n\n \n \n\f25 \n\nbecause there simply is no evidence that the Legislature \nacted, in 2011 or 2013, for the purpose of discriminating \nagainst Hispanic citizens in Nueces County.  \n\nPurporting to rely on Feeney, 442 U.S. at 279, plain-\ntiffs argue that discriminatory purpose can be inferred \nfrom  the  Legislature’s  mere  knowledge  that  its  redis-\ntricting  would  have  “adverse  consequences  . . .  on  an \nidentifiable group—here, minority voters.” C.Br.47 n.25. \nAs an initial matter, there were no unlawful adverse con-\nsequences  because  there  was  no  vote  dilution.  Regard-\nless,  that  radical  argument  conflicts  directly  with \nFeeney,  which  admonished  that  “‘[d]iscriminatory  pur-\npose’ . . . implies more than intent as volition or intent as \nawareness  of  consequences.”  Feeney,  442  U.S.  at  279. \nThis is especially true in the redistricting context, where \n“the legislature always is aware of race.” Bethune-Hill \nv.  Va.  State  Bd.  of  Elections,  137  S. Ct.  788,  797  (2017) \n(quoting Shaw, 509 U.S. at 646). Thus, this Court cited \nFeeney  when  it  made  clear  that  partisan  redistricting \ndoes  not  become  racial  gerrymandering  “even  if  it  so \nhappens that the most loyal Democrats happen to be [mi-\nnorities]  and  even  if  the  State  were  conscious  of  that \nfact.” Hunt v. Cromartie, 526 U.S. at 551.  \n\nWith no other leg to stand on, plaintiffs contend that \nthis case “obvious[ly] parallels” LULAC, asserting that \nthe 2011 Legislature impermissibly “engineered a trade \nthat took §2 rights from those who have them to provide \na §2 remedy to those who do not.” C.Br.51-52. This the-\nory has no basis in evidence. The State has never argued \nthat  CD35  “offset”  CD27.  Cf.  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  429. \nRegardless,  the  Legislature  could  not  “take”  §2  rights \n\n \n \n\f26 \n\nfrom  Hispanic  voters  in  Nueces  County  because  those \nvoters do not have a VRA §2 right to be placed in a ma-\njority-minority  district,  as  it  is  impossible  to  draw  an-\nother  majority-minority  district  in  the  area.  See  C.J.S. \nApp.  114a,  127a-131a,  421a.  That  readily  distinguishes \nthis  case  from  LULAC,  where  the  State  could  have \ndrawn another majority-minority district in the relevant \narea,  but  opted  not  to  do  so.  LULAC,  548  U.S.  at  429. \nAccordingly,  the  fact  that  CD35  is  a  majority-minority \ndistrict is simply irrelevant to plaintiffs’ unfounded chal-\nlenge to CD27. \n\n3.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \n\nin Bell County state-house districts. \n\nPlaintiffs  understandably  have  very  little  to  say \nabout the district court’s incoherent conclusion regard-\ning Bell County state-house districts. The district court \ncorrectly found no §2 results violation because it is un-\ndisputed that a “majority-minority CVAP” district can-\nnot be drawn in Bell County. H.J.S. App. 18a, 180a. And \nit correctly found that the 2011 Legislature’s “failure to \ncreate  the  proposed  [coalition]  districts  was  not  inten-\ntional vote dilution.” H.J.S. App. 18a.  \n\nDespite these findings, the district court perplexingly \nfound  “intentional  discrimination/vote  dilution.”  H.J.S. \nApp. 22a. It purported to base that finding on “evidence \nthat  mapdrawers  . . .  intentionally  racially  gerryman-\ndered the district.” H.J.S. App. 18a. But no plaintiff even \nasserted a racial-gerrymandering claim in Bell County, \nH.J.S. App. 192a-193a—and with good reason, as there \nis no evidence that race predominated in the creation of \nBell  County  state-house  districts.  Having  rejected \n\n \n \n\f27 \n\nclaims  of  intentional  vote  dilution  and  vote-dilution  ef-\nfect, and having recognized that plaintiffs did not bring \nracial-gerrymandering claims, the district court had no \nbasis to find any violation in Bell County. \n\n4.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \n\nin Dallas County state-house districts. \n\nPlaintiffs  do  not  dispute  plaintiff  MALC’s  expert’s \nconcession  that  it  was  not  possible  to  create  additional \ndistricts in Dallas County with an African-American or \nHispanic citizen-voting-age-population majority.9 Nor do \nthey dispute that the 2011 Legislature designed HD105 \nto  pair  two  Republican  incumbents.  The  district  court \ncorrectly rejected plaintiffs’ claims that the 2011 Legis-\nlature engaged in vote dilution by failing to create coali-\ntion  districts.  H.J.S.  App.  26a.  And  plaintiffs  did  not \nbring  racial-gerrymandering  claims  in  Dallas  County. \nH.J.S. App. 192a-193a. The district court thus had no ba-\nsis to hold that the 2011 Legislature, let alone the 2013 \nLegislature,  engaged  in  either  intentional  vote  dilution \nor racial gerrymandering.  \n\n9 Plaintiffs’ claim that under the 2011 plan, “Anglos controlled \nnearly 60% of Dallas County’s house seats with only one-third \nof  its  population,”  H.Br.12,  is  misleading  because  it  relies  on \ntotal  population  rather  than  voting-eligible  population.  The \ndistrict  court  recognized  that  of  approximately  900,000  His-\npanic residents of Dallas County, “only 256,195 were Hispanic \ncitizens of voting age.” H.J.S. App. 169a. Vote-dilution claims \nrequire  examination  of  voting-eligible  population.  See,  e.g., \nLULAC, 548 U.S. at 429. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f28 \n\n5.  There was no discriminatory intent or effect \nin Nueces County state-house districts. \n\nNueces  County’s  state-house  plan  is  the  only  area \nwhere the district court sustained a VRA §2 vote-dilution \nresults claim in addition to an intent claim. But neither \nof those findings can withstand scrutiny, as plaintiffs do \nnot and cannot contend that the Legislature could have \ndrawn  two  performing  majority-Hispanic  districts  in \nNueces County.10 In fact, the district court expressly de-\nclined to hold that VRA §2  required the Legislature to \ndraw two majority-minority districts in Nueces County. \nH.J.S. App. 60a. That is fatal to plaintiffs’ claims. \n\nNevertheless, the district court found both vote-dilu-\ntive intent and vote-dilutive effects on the basis that the \n2011  Legislature  failed  to  “explor[e]  whether  two \nHCVAP-majority districts wholly within Nueces County \nshould  be  drawn.”  H.J.S.  App.  59a.  But  any  additional \n“exploration”  would  have  been  futile  because  two  per-\nforming majority-Hispanic districts could not be drawn. \nPlaintiff  MALC’s  own  expert  concluded  that  drawing \ntwo  Hispanic-CVAP-majority  districts  wholly  within \nNueces County would result in “a lack of real electoral \nopportunity in both districts.” H.J.S. App. 44a (emphasis \nadded). The Legislature’s choice to avoid that pitfall was \nneither intentional nor actual vote dilution. \n\n10  Plaintiffs  do  not  challenge  the  district  court’s  holding  that \nVRA  §2  did  not  require  the  State  to  break  its  whole-county \nrule. See Br.66 (citing H.J.S. App. 49a-50a, 59a). \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f29 \n\nB.  There Was No Racial Gerrymandering in CD35. \nPlaintiffs do not deny that CD35 was drawn as one of \nseven  majority-Hispanic  districts  in  the  region,  or  that \nthe  Legislature  was  required  to  draw  seven  such  dis-\ntricts in 2011.11 Nor do plaintiffs argue that the Gingles \npreconditions, including racial bloc voting, are not satis-\nfied in CD35 as a whole. See U.S.Br.48. That should lay \nto rest any doubts about whether the Legislature had the \nrequisite “good reasons” to make it a majority-minority \ndistrict.  \n\nPlaintiffs  nonetheless  claim  (C.Br.38-39)  that  CD35 \nwas a racial gerrymander because racial bloc voting does \nnot  exist  in  Travis  County—which  comprises  only  a \nsmall fraction of the population and area of CD35.12 See \nU.S.Br.48.  Plaintiffs  fundamentally  misunderstand  the \nGingles inquiry. As this Court explained just last Term, \n“[t]he ultimate object of the inquiry” is the “district as a \nwhole.” Bethune-Hill, 137 S. Ct. at 800. Indeed, it must \nbe, because the question under the third Gingles condi-\ntion is whether “racially polarized voting prevents” a mi-\nnority  group  from  electing  its  candidate  of  choice. \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1470 (quoting Growe v. Emison, 507 \nU.S. 25, 40 (1993)).  \n\nCooper  v.  Harris  does  not  support  plaintiffs’  argu-\nment (C.Br.43) that the absence of racial bloc voting in a \n\n11  The  relevant  region  is  South,  Central,  and  West  Texas. \nC.J.S. App. 423a. Plaintiffs’ term “the envelope,” C.Br.4, was \nconcocted  in  litigation  to  establish  a  fictitious  geographic \nboundary. \n\n12  Travis  County  accounts  for  only  21%  of  CD35’s  population. \nC.J.S. App. 181a. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f30 \n\nportion of a district defeats the third Gingles condition. \nCooper held that the State lacked good reasons to believe \nthat VRA §2 required it to add additional minority voters \nto an existing district that consistently elected minority-\npreferred  candidates.  137  S.  Ct.  at  1465-66.  Cooper did \nnot hold that VRA §2 cannot justify a new district, like \nCD35, merely because racial bloc voting may not exist in \na portion too small to control outcomes in the district as \na whole. \n\nPlaintiffs  rely  on  Shaw  v.  Hunt,  517  U.S.  899,  916 \n(1996), to argue that the Legislature did not have license \nto  draw  a  majority-minority  district  “anywhere”—by \nwhich  they  mean  to  draw  a  majority-minority  district \nthat  included  Travis  County.  C.Br.42.  But  the  Legisla-\nture  could  lawfully  draw  the  district  anywhere  it  had \ngood  reason  to  believe  all  three  Gingles  factors  were \nmet.  Cf.  Shaw,  517  U.S.  at  916  (racial  classification  did \nnot remedy VRA violation because district did not meet \nfirst Gingles requirement). And that is exactly what the \nLegislature did when it created CD35.  \n\nIn all events, the VRA-compliance defense to a racial-\ngerrymandering claim does not require a “perfect” VRA \nanalysis  ahead  of  time.  Cooper,  137  S.  Ct.  at  1464.  Ra-\nther, so long as the Legislature had “good reason” to be-\nlieve the district would remedy a potential VRA §2 prob-\nlem  (even  if  it  turns  out  that  the  VRA  did  not  actually \nrequire the district), then the district is not a racial ger-\nrymander.  Id.  at  1470.  Here,  plaintiff’s  counsel  MAL-\nDEF  proposed  CD35’s  Austin-to-San-Antonio  configu-\nration,  C.J.S.  App.  411a;  and  the  Latino  Task  Force \nplaintiffs  supported  CD35,  C.J.S.  App.  174a.  These  are \n\n \n \n\f31 \n\nabout the best reasons possible to believe that CD35 was \nneeded to satisfy VRA §2. \n\nPlaintiffs’ real complaint is not that the Legislature \nincluded part of Travis County in CD35, but that it elim-\ninated  an  Anglo-majority  crossover  district  previously \nbased  in  Travis  County.  But  the  district  court  did  not \nfind a violation on this basis, Br.47 n.12, because it cor-\nrectly  recognized  that  §2  does  not  require  the  State  to \npreserve  crossover  districts.  C.J.S.  App.  409a  (citing \nBartlett, 556 U.S. at 23). Plaintiffs racial-gerrymander-\ning claim is just another attempted end-run around Bart-\nlett.  \n\nIV. There Was No Racial Gerrymandering In HD90. \n\nFinally, the 2013 Legislature did not engage in racial \ngerrymandering when it modified HD90 to accommodate \nrequests  from  two  different  groups  of  minority  voters. \nPlaintiffs do not dispute that HD90 was drawn as a ma-\njority-Hispanic district at plaintiffs’ request in 2011 and \nretained  by  the  district  court  in  2012. See H.J.S.  Supp. \nApp. 258a-259a. They do not suggest that this configura-\ntion was not required by VRA §2, nor do they attempt to \ndefend the district court’s patently incorrect holding that \nVRA compliance is just “a vague goal,” rather than a de-\nfense  to  a  racial-gerrymandering  claim.  And  the  only \nother explanation the district court offered for its ruling \non HD90 is readily refuted by the undisputed evidence. \nAccording  to  the  district  court,  “no  one  considered  the \nlegal  significance  of  the  50%  [Spanish-surname-voter-\nregistration]  target  in  terms  of  compliance  with  the \nVRA.” H.J.S. App. 82a. But the record shows that plain-\ntiff  MALC  specifically  objected  to  the  initial  draft \namendment  to  HD90  on  the  ground  that  reducing  the \n\n \n \n\f32 \n\nSpanish-surname-voter-registration population in HD90 \nbelow  50%  would  substantially  dilute  Hispanic  voting \nstrength. J.A. 398a-403a.13  \n\nPlaintiffs  do  not  dispute  that  this  objection  directly \nmotivated  the  incumbent’s  chief  of  staff—whose  intent \nthe district court attributed to the Legislature—to con-\nsider racial data to maintain HD90’s Spanish-surname-\nvoter-registration majority.14 Instead, they blithely sug-\ngest that the Legislature should have simply refused to \nbring the Como neighborhood back into HD90. H.Br.54-\n55  &  n.15.  But  plaintiffs  tellingly  do  not  acknowledge \nthat Como is a predominantly African-American neigh-\nborhood—they describe it as “non-Latino,” H.Br.54—or \nthat residents of Como specifically asked to return their \nneighborhood  to  HD90,  where it  had  been  for  decades. \nH.J.S. App. 71a-72a. There was nothing unlawful about \nreturning  Como  to  HD90  so  long  as  the  Legislature \nmaintained HD90 as a majority-Hispanic district.  \n\nIndeed, even though the Legislature made sure that \nHD90 maintained a Hispanic voting majority, the State \nstill  faced  an  intentional-vote-dilution  claim  in  HD90. \nAnd  the  district  court  rejected  that  claim  only  because \nthe  Legislature  retained  HD90  as  a  majority-Hispanic \n\n13  Plaintiffs  cannot  avoid  that  evidence  based  on  “credibility \ndeterminations.”  H.Br.53.  They  identify  no  credibility  deter-\nmination  related  to  HD90,  and  none  appears  in  the  district \ncourt’s order. \n\n14  Plaintiffs  fault  the  Legislature  for  failing  to  compile  a  de-\ntailed administrative record in HD90, H.Br.54, but that is not \nrequired, see Bush v. Vera, 517 U.S. 952, 966 (1996) (plurality \nop.);  accord  id.  at  1026  (Stevens,  J.,  dissenting),  and  it  does \nnot change the undisputed facts. \n\n \n \n                                            \n\f33 \n\ndistrict. H.J.S. App. 83a-84a. If that does not qualify as \n“good  reason”  to  retain  a  majority-Hispanic  district, \nCooper, 137 S. Ct. at 1470, then States have no breathing \nroom left to satisfy both the Constitution and the VRA. \n\nC O N C L U S IO N \n\nThe Court should reverse the district court’s orders \ninsofar as they invalidate districts in Plan C235 and Plan \nH358. \n\nRespectfully submitted. \n\nPAUL D.
